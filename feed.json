      "The Vestavia Hills Police Department, which is investigating Meek's death, has not issued any public statements.",
      "Meek made his on-screen debut in 2014's \u201cThe Santa Con,\u201d and had roles in various TV series, including \u201cMacGyver.\u201d He was perhaps best known for his role in the 2017 film \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d in which he played a younger version of Ansel Elgort's titular character.",

      "As season two of Netflix's hit series \u201cSquid Game\u201d returns Thursday, viewers can expect more untimely deaths for many of its characters",
      "Viewers may gasp, cringe or cry out watching characters die on Netflix's \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but those simulated deaths have a different effect on its creator, writer and director. Instead, Hwang Dong-hyuk feels happiness seeing them go.",
      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d season two premieres Thursday. It once again stars Lee Jung-jae and centers around a secret competition in South Korea that targets people in debt and the winner gets a big cash prize. What they don't know is that losing the game is deadly.",
      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",
      "\u201cI never in my wildest dream thought it was going to be this huge,\u201d said Hwang, who spoke with the AP about the show and what comes next. Answers have been edited for clarity and length.",
      "___",
      "HWANG: I learned that I shouldn\u2019t give up. If you love something and if you want to create something, it might not work now, but the time might come later. Or that idea could be the source of inspiration for something else.",
      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

      "Hitmaking record producer Richard Perry has died at 82",
      "Richard Perry, a hitmaking record producer with a flair for both standards and contemporary sounds whose many successes included Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d series and a Ringo Starr album featuring all four Beatles, died Tuesday. He was 82.",
      "Perry, a recipient of a Grammys Trustee Award in 2015, died at a Los Angeles hospital after suffering cardiac arrest, friend Daphna Kastner said.",
      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",
      "Perry was a onetime drummer, oboist and doo-wop singer who proved at home with a wide variety of musical styles, the rare producer to have No. 1 hits on the pop, R&B, dance and country charts. He was on hand for Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d and The Pointer Sisters' \u201cI\u2019m So Excited,\u201d Tiny Tim\u2019s novelty smash \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d and the Willie Nelson-Julio Iglesias lounge standard \u201cTo All the Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Perry was widely known as a \u201cmusician\u2019s producer,\u201d treating artists like peers rather than vehicles for his own tastes. Singers turned to him whether trying to update their sound (Barbra Streisand), set back the clock (Stewart), revive their career (Fats Domino) or fulfill early promise (Leo Sayer).",
      "\u201cRichard had a knack for matching the right song to the right artist,\u201d Streisand wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s life was a story, in part, of famous friends and the right places. He was backstage for 1950s performances by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, sat in the third row at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival during Otis Redding\u2019s memorable set and attended a recording session for the Rolling Stones\u2019 classic \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d album. A given week might find him dining one night with Paul and Linda McCartney, and Mick and Bianca Jagger the next. He dated Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda among others and was briefly married to the actor Rebecca Broussard.",
      "In Stewart's autobiography, \u201cRod,\u201d he would remember Perry's home in West Hollywood as \u201cthe scene of much late-night skulduggery through the 1970s and beyond, and a place you knew you could always fall into at the end of an evening for a full-blown knees-up with drink and music and dancing.\u201d",
      "In the '70s, Perry helped facilitate a near-Beatles reunion.",
      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",
      "\u201cShe had a number of issues that went unaddressed and found coping mechanisms to get through life,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cI think a lot of people are undiagnosed with things and just make do. Maybe she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fear,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was the fear that I focused on the most. She attacks before anyone can attack her, and she thinks everyone is attacking her.\u201d",
      "But Pansy\u2019s specific diagnosis isn\u2019t the point of \u201cHard Truths.\u201d It's much more about how her family and the outside world react to her. She might be pushing everyone away, but it's clear she's in urgent need of something.",
      "\u201cI want so desperately for someone to help Pansy,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think it would be very convenient to go, \u2018She\u2019s got this mental illness or that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her.\u2019 But what\u2019s more interesting is that we don\u2019t actually know and she\u2019s just in pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d ultimately ends in a kind of cliffhanger, with Pansy and her family locked in stasis. If Pansy tests the boundaries of empathy an audience might feel for a character, it's a moment of truth: Does Pansy go to her husband or refuse to budge? Jean-Baptiste wants to believe in her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she goes, I do, because I like her,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI like Pansy. I gotta look out for her.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",

      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a Korean phrase, \u2018there\u2019s not a sequel that does better than its prequel,\u2019 said actor Yang Dong-geong, whose character debuts in season two. \"I've been careful because we aren't really sure what the reaction will be.\u201d The outlook is positive. Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",
      "The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer. Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his villain role from season one, has appeared in big budget English-language films like \u201cG.I.

      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that I\u2019ve been in. If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

      "Madison Square Garden is a staple of the NBA's Christmas schedule. Now it merges with a bigger home of the holidays, because the \u201cDunk the Halls\u201d game will be staged at Disney, on a court set up right smack in the middle of where countless families have posed for vacation photos.",
      "Why that location?",
      "Because it was Mickey Mouse\u2019s Christmas wish.",
      "\u201cBasketball courts often have the ability to make a normal environment look special, but in Disney it can only turn out incredible,\u201d Wembanyama said in an ESPN video promoting his Christmas debut.",
      "The story \u2014 this is Disney, after all \u2014 begins with Mickey penning a letter to Santa Claus, asking if he and his pals can host a basketball game. They'll not only get to watch one with NBA players, but some of them will even get to play. Goofy and Donald Duck will sub in for a couple Knicks players, while Mickey and Minnie Mouse will come on to play for the Spurs.",
      "\u201cIt looks to me like Goofy and Jalen Brunson have a really good pick-and-roll at the elite level,\u201d said Phil Orlins, an ESPN vice president of production.",
      "Walt Disney World hosted real NBA games in 2020, when the league set up there to complete its season that had been suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those games were played at the ESPN Wide World of Sports.",
      "The setting for the Christmas game will be Main Street USA, at the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. Viewers will recognize Cinderella\u2019s castle behind one baseline and the train station at the other end, and perhaps some shops they have visited in between.",
      "Previous alternate animated broadcasts included an NFL game taking place in Andy's room from \u201cToy Story;\u201d the \u201cNHL Big City Greens Classic\u201d during a game between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers; and earlier this month, another NFL matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys also taking place at Springfield\u2019s Atoms Stadium as part of \u201c The Simpsons Funday Football. \u201d",
      "Unlike basketball, the players are helmeted in those sports. So, this telecast required an extra level of detail and cooperation with players and teams to create accurate appearances of their faces and hairstyles.",
      "\"So, this is a level of detail that we\u2019ve never gone, that we\u2019ve never done on any other broadcast,\" said David Sparrgrove, the senior director of creative animation for ESPN.",
      "Wembanyama, the 7-foot-3 phenom from France who was last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, looks huge even among most NBA players. The creators of the alternate telecast had to design how he'd look not only among his teammates and rivals, but among mice, ducks and chipmunks.",
      "\u201cLike, Victor Wembanyama, seeing him in person is insane. It\u2019s like seeing an alien descend on a basketball court, and I think we kind of captured that in his animated character,\u201d said Drew Carter, who will again handle play-by-play duties, as he had in the previous animated telecasts, and will get an assist from sideline reporter Daisy Duck.",
      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast. The noon EST start means it will begin in the early evening in France and should draw well there. Also, it comes after ABC televises the \u201cDisney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade\u201d for the previous two hours, providing more time to hype the broadcast.",
      "Recognizing that some viewers who then switch over to the animated game may be Disney experts but NBA novices, there will be 10 educational explainers to help with basketball lingo and rules.",
      "Beyond Sports' visualization technology and Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye tracking allow the animated players to make the same movements and plays made moments earlier by the real ones at MSG. Carter and analyst Monica McNutt will be animated in the style of the telecast, donning VR headsets to experience the game from Main Street, USA.",
      "Other animated faces recognizable to some viewers include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who will judge a halftime dunk contest among Mickey and his friends, and Santa himself, who will operate ESPN\u2019s \u201cSkyCam\u201d during the game.",
      "The players are curious how the production \u2014 and themselves \u2014 will look.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so crazy to see the game animated,\u201d Spurs veteran Chris Paul said. \u201cI think what\u2019s dope about it is it will give kids another opportunity to watch a game and to see us, basically, as characters.\u201d",

      "\"Sonic 3\" nearly doubled the haul for \"Mufasa.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d sped past the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters.",
      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",
      "\u201cMoonlight\u201d filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs \u201cMufasa's\u201d voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",
      "Many of Disney\u2019s live-action adaptations \u2013 including \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cJungle Book\u201d \u2013 have been big hits. Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.",
      "Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",
      "Family films like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cSonic 3\u201d have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26% of this year's box office.",
      "\u201cThe box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",

      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the first severe case of the illness in the United States",
      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation\u2019s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week.",
      "Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans \u2014 something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm.",
      "Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work.",
      "\u201cIs this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cRight now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn\u2019t open the door.\u201d",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms.",
      "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month.",
      "The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were \u201cconcerning,\u201d but the risk to the general public from the outbreak \u201chas not changed and remains low.\u201d",
      "Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what\u2019s happening with mutations carefully.",
      "\u201cThere will be additional influenza pandemics and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,\" he said. \"We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don\u2019t know what time it is.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon house cat died after eating pet food that tested positive for bird flu, Oregon authorities said, prompting a recall of raw frozen pet food that was sold nationwide.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\u201d Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cThis cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\u201d",
      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",
      "So far, the CDC has confirmed one human case of bird flu in Oregon. The person was linked to a previously reported outbreak at a commercial poultry operation and fully recovered after experiencing mild illness, according to a November news release from the Oregon Health Authority.",
      "In late October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that a pig at a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu, marking the first detection of the virus in U.S. swine.",

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden has signed the annual defense authorization bill into law despite his objections to language banning transgender health care for military children",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law a defense bill that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion despite his objections to language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children in military families.",
      "Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents\u2019 roles to determine the best care for their children.\u201d He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",
      "\u201cNo service member should have to decide between their family\u2019s health care access and their call to serve our nation,\u201d the president said in a statement.",
      "The Senate forwarded the bill to Biden after passing it last week by a vote of 85-14. In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.",
      "Biden also objected to other language in the bill prohibiting the use of money earmarked to transfer detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to some foreign countries and into the United States. He urged Congress to lift those restrictions.",
      "The annual defense authorization bill, which directs Pentagon policy, provides a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others.",
      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.",
      "The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.",
      "The legislation still must be backed up with a spending package.",

      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",
      "During his campaign, Trump flip-flopped on abortion policy and at points attempted to distance himself from abortion opponents. Since he won the election, though, he has nominated abortion opponents to administration posts.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published this month, he gave rambling answers to questions about pills. He said he intended to maintain access but also left the door open to changing his mind.",

      "",
      "In addition, participants had less positive attitudes toward patients as measured by Provider Attitudes Toward Sickle Cell Patients Scale (PASS) scores after hearing biased handoffs (mean scores 22.9 vs 25.2, P<0.001), they reported in JAMA Network Open.",
      "",
      "\"People are getting it right more often when they hear the neutral [version],\" Wesevich told MedPage Today. \"It's pretty compelling that there's some sort of distraction or cognitive effect of having to neutralize out the biased phrases.\"",
      "",
      "In an invited commentary, Somnath Saha, MD, MPH, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the effect of biased language on information recall \"intriguing.\"",
      "",
      "\"At first glance, it seems that this effect might be a matter of simple distraction,\" they wrote. \"The human brain has finite capacity for retaining information, and the addition of clinically uninformative details might have crowded out information that was clinically important.\"",
      "",
      "The findings suggest that \"by engendering more negative attitudes toward the patient,\" they added, \"stigmatizing language may lessen the clinician's investment in the patient's well-being and thereby reduce the clinician's motivation to retain the information needed to provide optimal care for the patient.\"",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues surveyed 169 residents and medical students (56% female, mean age 28.6), each of whom heard three recorded handoffs, which were a combination of neutral and biased. The biased handoffs were one of three types  --  stereotype, blame, or doubt  --  and they all came from a previous study by Wesevich's group.",
      "",
      "That study involved recording residents doing handoffs, and it found that biased phrases were more common in notes about patients who were Black or obese. While they changed small details to protect patient identity, the biased handoffs are largely true to the words used in the recorded handoffs in the earlier study, Wesevich told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A court in Belarus convicted a well-known opposition activist and sentenced him to six years in prison, the country's oldest and most prominent human rights group, Viasna, reported Friday. The move is the latest in the unabating crackdown against dissent that the country's authorities have unleashed in recent years.",
      "Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, was convicted of gross violations of public order and calling for actions aimed at undermining national security. He was sentenced to six years in prison and fined about $6,000, Viasna reported. The verdict in Kuchuk's trial, which took place behind closed doors in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, was announced on Tuesday, but rights advocates only found out days later.",

      "The authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for successive 15-day stints and then filed criminal charges against him, Viasna said. According to the group, the activist was beaten up during his arrest, and his health deteriorated while he was in pre-trial detention.",

Security forces dispersed the rallies and arrested more than 65,000 people in the four years since.",

      "Germany is headed for a national election seven months early",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition.",
      "Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany\u2019s stagnant economy.",
      "Steinmeier said he made the decision because it was clear after consultation with party leaders that there was no agreement among Germany's political parties on a majority for a new, stable government in the current parliament.",
      "\u201cIt is precisely in difficult times like these that stability requires a government capable of taking action and a reliable majority in parliament,\u201d he said as he made the announcement in Berlin.",
      "\"Therefore I am convinced that for the good of our country new elections are the right way.\u201d",
      "Since the post-World War II constitution doesn\u2019t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Leaders of several major parties agreed earlier on the election date of Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned.",
      "The campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz\u2019s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz\u2019s government, is also bidding for the top job \u2014 though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party.",
      "Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.",
      "The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it.",
      "Germany\u2019s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government.",
      "It\u2019s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany\u2019s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly has voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country\u2019s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment.",
      "Han\u2019s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country\u2019s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han\u2019s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and surrounded the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated, shouting that the vote was \u201cinvalid\u201d and demanding Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported.",
      "The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han\u2019s impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-member assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president\u2019s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",
      "In a statement, Han called his impeachment \u201cregrettable\u201d but said he respects the assembly's decision and will suspend his duties to \u201cnot add to additional confusion and uncertainty.\u201d He said he will wait for \u201ca swift, wise decision\u201d by the Constitutional Court.",
      "Han\u2019s powers were officially suspended after copies of his impeachment document were delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, took over.",
      "Later Friday, Choi's office said he instructed the military to boost its readiness to help prevent North Korea from miscalculating the situation and launching provocations. He also told the foreign ministry to inform the U.S., Japan and other major partners that South Korea's foreign policies remain unchanged.",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment. That\u2019s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Yoon\u2019s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn\u2019t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning,",
      "His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon\u2019s decree.",
      "South Korean media reported that prosecutors indicted former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun for allegedly playing a key role in Yoon's rebellion plot and committing abuse of power and obstruction. The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered.",
      "Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels.",
      "The martial law enactment, the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea, lasted only six hours but it caused political turmoil in South Korea, triggered alarms from its neighbors and rattled markets. Yoon has defended his decree as an act of governance, saying it was a warning to the Democratic Party which he said has been using its parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda.",

      "NEW DELHI -- Authorities in India have declared a seven-day mourning period to honor Manmohan Singh, officials said Friday, as politicians and public paid tributes to the country\u2019s former prime minister widely regarded as the architect of India\u2019s economic reform program.",

He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party\u2019s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister."

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "President Zoran Milanovi\u0107 is seen as a favorite ahead of the presidential election on Sunday, though he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12.",
      "The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanovi\u0107 had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 and a continuous sparring of the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenkovi\u0107's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive.",
      "Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and other heads of states attended the meeting of the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.",

      "The carefully choreographed session at a resort near St. Petersburg veered off script when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whose country was taking the rotating chairmanship in the economic grouping from Armenia, urged Pashinyan to visit Belarus for the union's next meeting.",
      "Pashinyan responded that he plans to attend the Belarus meeting via video call, after which Lukashenko pressed for an explanation and even offered to send a plane to fly the Armenian delegation to the Belarusian capital.",
      "Pashinyan then pointed to his earlier decision to freeze high-level visits to Belarus over Lukashenko's support for Armenia's rival, Azerbaijan.",
      "\u201cI don't think this is the right format for discussing these issues,\" Pashinyan added.",
      "But Lukashenko kept arguing and Pashinyan snapped back. Putin, who sat next to Lukashenko, and other leaders watched the altercation in stony silence.",
      "The Eurasian Economic Union was formed a decade ago to encourage stronger business ties and facilitate trade between its members, but it has been marred by economic and other dispoutes between members."

      "529 college savings plans are powerful tools to help pay for the mounting costs of an education",
      "529 college savings plans \u202fare powerful tools to help pay for the mounting costs of an education. Why are some people hesitant to use them?",
      "One common concern is oversaving. You can use 529 funds to cover only\u202f qualified education expenses \u202fwithout incurring a tax penalty, but it can be hard to pinpoint how much money you actually need.",
      "Many parents open 529s for their children when they are born; they have no way of knowing whether their kids will earn a scholarship or even go to college at all. Fortunately, parents of multiple children can change the beneficiary of a 529 plan.",
      "But what do you do if you still have money left over after covering education expenses?",
      "Thanks to\u202f Secure 2.0, college savers won\u2019t have to worry about overfunding their 529s. Starting this year, you can now\u202f roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA. But don\u2019t think the 529 rollover is a loophole to save extra for retirement; there are rules that limit the conversions.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should consider when converting your 529 funds to a Roth IRA.",
      "The Roth IRA receiving the funds must be in the name of the 529 plan beneficiary.",
      "The 529 plan must be open for at least 15 years.",
      "You cannot convert 529 contributions made within the past five years (or the earnings on those contributions).",
      "The 529 funds you roll over count toward your IRA annual contribution limit.",
      "You can move a maximum of $35,000 from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA during your lifetime.",
      "529 funds must be converted by paying the amount directly to a Roth IRA\u2014you can\u2019t pay yourself and then deposit the money into the Roth IRA later.",
      "You can contribute to a Roth IRA only if you have earnings from a job, so the 529 beneficiary must have eligible earnings when the 529-to-IRA conversions occur.",
      "Roth IRA income limits do not apply to 529 rollovers.",
      "While avoiding the\u202f Roth IRA \u202fincome limits is a retirement-saving perk for those with higher income, the rest of the rules around rolling over your excess 529 funds are designed to ensure that people are using 529 plans for their intended purpose: education. The annual contribution limits as well as the lifetime cap on conversions mean that you can\u2019tdouble up on your retirement funding.",
      "So, what\u2019s the bottom line?",
      "The ability to convert unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA can help alleviate potential concerns about oversaving for education. Still, don\u2019t count on your 529 as a means to save for retirement. Instead, consider funding your Roth IRA separately.",

      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people\u2019s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries",
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people's lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries.",
      "This ability to store large amounts of electricity in batteries was essentially nonexistent a decade ago, but the country had about 24 gigawatt-hours operating as of the end of November, up a whopping 71% over the same date in 2023.",
      "This is welcome news to clean energy advocates including Dariella Rodriguez. She has seen what happens on days when demand for air conditioning or heating spikes and extra power plants fueled by natural gas, located in Port Morris and Mott Haven, fire up not far from where she works in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, New York.",
      "Batteries can jolt into service, sending electricity onto overhead wires, instead of these dirty \u201cpeaker\u201d plants. Rodriguez hasn't seen that transition yet, but she hopes to.",
      "\u201cThe people that are exposed to these plants are the most vulnerable people in environmental justice communities already,\u201d said Rodriguez, a director at THE POINT Community Development Corporation there, noting that lower-income people and communities of color often live near peakers.",
      "The nation\u2019s 1,000 peaker plants can be very dirty, inefficient and expensive, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog group that works for the U.S. Congress. Some 63 million people are estimated to live within a three-mile radius of one.",
      "Although peakers run only a small part of the time, they release more harmful nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide per unit of energy, the agency said. Those two pollutants cause asthma and other breathing problems.",
      "Peakers also release more greenhouse gases than other power plants do per unit of electricity.",
      "Batteries are \u201ca really obvious solution\u201d to reducing need for peakers, says Daniel Chu, senior energy planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance.",
      "Storing extra power in batteries also extends the hours of the day that you can use clean energy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always sunny, the wind\u2019s not always blowing, but energy storage can help move that generation to when it\u2019s most needed,\u201d said Tim Fox, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners.",
      "That's why at least half of battery storage facilities in the U.S. are co-located with, or in some other way support solar, an AP analysis of Energy Information Administration data shows. The amount of solar energy in the U.S. is growing and surpassed the 100-gigawatt mark this year.",
      "Another way that the addition of these batteries is helpful to the American electrical grid and grids around the world is that forecasting is getting more difficult.",
      "\u201cWith weather patterns changing, the old ways of essentially figuring out how much capacity you need on the grid for extreme events just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Oliver Garnett, director of energy services product at the technology company Fermata Energy.",
      "Last, global electricity demand is slated to increase \u2014 by about one-third to three-quarters by 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. Data centers for artificial intelligence, switching vehicles to electricity and population growth are all contributing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do we have enough power plants?\u2019 is the classic question every utility asks every year,\u201d said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the science nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe beauty of the batteries is that if there\u2019s energy in them, they can be used for unexpected needs.\u201d",
      "Otherwise, if utilities have to find more power generation, they may keep investing in plants that burn gas or coal and account for one-quarter of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, instead of retiring them.",
      "Leading the charge for adding new batteries to the grid this year was California with more than 11 gigawatt-hours operating. One way to think about this is roughly the amount of electricity that a nuclear power plant would put out over 11 hours. Then the batteries would need to be recharged to do the same thing again. It's a limited, but meaningful amount of power. In Texas, 6 gigawatt-hours were online. Arizona saw nearly 2 gigawatt-hours humming and Nevada \u2014 the fourth-largest deployer of storage in the U.S. \u2014 had 1.1 gigawatt-hours operational.",
      "Yet many states aren't using storage yet. As of November, 86% of large-scale battery storage in the U.S. was operating in just those four states.",
      "Some states haven't set targets telling utilities to go out and build or buy energy storage on their own. Only 18 states have 50 megawatt-hours or more operating.",
      "Others don't have as much clean electricity to pair with the batteries, or claim storage isn\u2019t reliable in times of crisis. It can also be challenging to connect storage to the grid. Still, experts expect more momentum.",
      "Especially in California and Texas, \u201cThat investment and that experiment is paying off very well,\u201d said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power.",
      "\u201cThe word is getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing the technology move to other parts of the country.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe question lurking is, what happens when $1 billion becomes routine and people don\u2019t care about it anymore?\u201d said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of the 2022 book \u201cFor a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's no easy round number after a billion,\u201d Cohen said. \"But also, how much money can one person possibly, possibly, possibly need?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Mega Millions' ticket prices will rise from $2 to $5 in April. The increase will be one of many changes that officials say will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts.",
      "Here's brief history of lotteries and why jackpots are growing:",
      "Cohen notes in his book that lotteries have existed in one form or another for more than 4,000 years.",
      "In Rome, emperors and nobles held drawings at dinner parties and awarded prizes that ranged from terracotta vases to people who were enslaved. As early as the 1400s, lotteries were used in Europe to fund city defenses and other public works.",
      "Sweepstakes were common in the American colonies, helping to pay for the revolution against Britain. Cohen noted in his book that Thomas Jefferson approved of lotteries, writing that they were a tax \u201claid on the willing only.\u201d",
      "Lotteries began to fall out of favor in the U.S. in the 1800s because of concerns over fraud, mismanagement and impacts on poor people. But starting in the 1960s, states began to legalize them to help address financial shortfalls without raising taxes.",
      "\u201cLotteries were seen as budgetary miracles, the chance for states to make revenue appear seemingly out of thin air,\u201d Cohen wrote.",
      "When Mega Millions started in 1996, it was called \u201cThe Big Game\u201d and involved only six states. It was meant to compete with Powerball, which then had 20 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The original payout for The Big Game started at $5 million. The value would be nearly twice that today accounting for inflation.",
      "In 2024 dollars, the before-taxes prize could buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution or cover Michael Soroka's $9 million contract to pitch next season for the Washington Nationals",
      "By contrast, the pre-tax winnings from Friday\u2019s Mega Millions prize could theoretically buy a Major League Baseball team. The Nationals would be too expensive. But Forbes recently valued the Miami Marlins at $1 billion.",
      "A better comparison might be Taylor Swift's tour revenue at the end of 2023. Her Eras Tour became the first to earn more than $1 billion after selling more than 4 million tickets.",
      "Swift, however, was expected to bring in a total of more than $2 billion when her tour finally wrapped up Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "These days, Mega Millions and its lottery compatriot Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico.",
      "In October, Mega Millions said it hoped increased ticket revenue and less stratospheric odds would lead to more people winning, even as prizes grow extraordinarily high.",
      "Games with massive payouts tend to be more popular despite the slimmer odds. Larger jackpots also attract more media attention, increase ticket sales and bring in new players, Cohen said.",
      "Lottery officials have allowed the odds to become lower with a larger pool of numbers to pick from, Cohen said. And that has made games harder to win, leading to payouts rolling over into even larger prizes.",
      "The first billion-dollar jackpot was in 2016. Cohen said he expects the upward trajectory to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, he warned against the tropes of the troubled or bankrupt lottery winner.",
      "A well-known example is Andrew \u201cJack\u201d Whittaker Jr. He won a record Powerball jackpot after buying a single ticket in 2002 but quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks as he endured constant requests for money, leaving him unable to trust others.",
      "Most winners don't turn out like him, Cohen said.",
      "\u201cEven if we deny it, we all sort of believe in the meritocracy \u2014 this belief that if you won your money through luck, then you probably didn\u2019t actually deserve it,\u201d Cohen said. And yet various studies have shown \u201clottery winners are happier, healthier and wealthier than the rest of us.\u201d",

While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The biggest wildcard for mortgage rates next year is whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives will contribute to higher inflation and swell the national debt, which could keep mortgage rates elevated. That\u2019s because what happens with inflation, the U.S. deficit and the economy can have an effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The yield, which was below 3.7% as recently as September, was at 4.61% in midday trading Thursday.",

      "Here are a few takeaways on electric vehicles in 2024: As of November, the global EV market grew by 25% year-over-year",
      "DETROIT -- Electric vehicles had another whirlwind year around the globe, driven by buyers in China, and growth in parts of Europe and the United States, despite headwinds.",
      "In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs.",
      "Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy. Road transport accounts for around one-sixth of all global emissions from energy, according to the International Energy Agency. Widespread EV adoption could significantly address climate change.",
      "Here are five facts about EVs this year. Most of the data comes from consultancy Rho Motion.",
      "The global EV market, including pure EVs and plug-in hybrids, grew by 25% year-over-year as of November.",
      "Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China.",
      "Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion.",
      "Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase.",
      "Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline.",
      "In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales.",
      "In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs.",
      "The best-selling pure electric vehicles were the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Tesla Model 3 \u2014 both globally and in the U.S., according to Rho Motion.",
      "The Model Y SUV was released in 2020. Its base version today costs nearly $45,000.",
      "The Model 3 was released in 2017. The least expensive version sells for around $42,000.",
      "Both have been eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S.",
      "Tesla's market share stood at 17% of all electric cars across the globe through October, according to Rho Motion.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla's market share was 49% through October. That means the company still has the biggest EV market share. But its hold is shrinking as other auto companies combined sell a growing number of electrics. For example, GM, Ford, Honda and more are offering a wider variety of EVs at lower prices and sizes and are chipping away at Tesla's longstanding lead.",

      "The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands, but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union's executive commission as part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. Russia's use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",
      "The Eagle S's anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle television reported, relying on police statements.",

      "Thousands of workers are facing an unsettling reality heading into 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- Jason LaCroix felt privileged to work from home, especially as a father to two young children. He needed flexibility when his son, then 6, suffered a brain injury and spent 35 days in intensive care.",
      "LaCroix, a senior systems engineer based in Atlanta, took time off and then worked from home while managing his son's care and appointments. But LaCroix was laid off last February from that job, where he'd been working remotely for five years. His new role requires him to spend four days a week in a company office and commute for three hours a day.",
      "\u201cI want to be around for my kids,\u201d LaCroix, 44, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to be around for my son, because we almost lost him.\u201d",
      "Heading into 2025, thousands of workers face an unsettling reality: after years of working from the comfort of home, they must return to the office full-time for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic or look for new work.",
      "Employees at Amazon, AT&T and other companies have been called back to the office five days per week. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to fire federal workers who don't show up to do their jobs in-person.",
      "\u201cPeople always want to have flexibility,\u201d said Mark Ma, a University of Pittsburgh associate professor of business administration. \u201cI have never heard anyone telling me that I thank my job because it\u2019s so rigid in its schedule.\u201d",
      "Ma researched what happened when technology and finance companies in the S&P 500 stopped allowing employees to work remotely in recent years. He found the companies experienced high turnover rates after implementing return-to-office mandates, especially among female employees \u2014 who often have childcare responsibilities \u2014 and senior-level executives.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people have adjusted their lives. They\u2019ve figured out, \u2018Oh wow, I can pick my kids up for school. Wow. I can caretake for my aging parents while I am still working,'\" said Shavon Terrell-Camper, a therapist and mental wellness coach. \u201cOnce you have tasted work-from-home ... it\u2019s difficult to see your life going back to something that could\u2019ve been unsustainable from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Workers and experts have advice to share about how to navigate the changes when an employer calls you back to the office.",
      "Employers can compromise if their goal is to increase how much time staff members spend together. Ma suggests an \u201cemployee-choice\u201d approach which gives teams the authority to decide how many days they will work in the office as a group.",
      "If that's not an option, employees also can ask to adjust their hours. LaCroix leaves home at 5 a.m. and works in the office until 2 p.m. to reduce time in traffic and allow him to be home when his kids get off the bus after school. His employer requires eight hours in the workplace but is flexible on which hours.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are pushing back, and they are trying to work out scenarios to see what type of flexibility does exist within the mandate,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Some are coming up with work-arounds that aren't endorsed by upper management. \u201cCoffee badging\u201d is a technique that involves heading to the office, swiping a company ID, having a coffee and leaving to work from home. Desperate to hold onto valuable employees, supervisors have tried a \u201chushed hybrid\u201d approach, where they take their subordinates\u2019 ID badges and swipe them \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d to make it appear they\u2019ve been in the office, Ma said.",
      "It's best to have an honest conversation with a manager about any personal needs and to \u201cask for forgiveness ahead of time, because your family is the most important thing,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. Many companies have employee assistance programs that do more than most people realize, such as directing employees to resources that can help them care for parents or children, she said.",
      "Medical conditions can make it especially challenging to work on-site. Kyle Ankney, a public relations strategist based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has cerebral palsy and needs a nurse to help him change a catheter three times a day. His health insurance will only send a nurse to one location, so working in an office isn't an option.",
      "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t an issue, I could find my way into the office,\u201d he said.",
      "Ankney, who ran his own PR firm for years, was seeking director-level roles, but a recruiter told him he should consider less-senior roles because of his need to work remotely. Instead, he applied to director-level jobs that were advertised as on-site or hybrid, and then reached out to explain his circumstances and ask if the hiring companies were open to him working from home.",
      "\u201cWhile I would never normally, especially in a career setting, lead with, \u2018I have cerebral palsy and I\u2019m in a wheelchair,\u2019 I\u2019m finding that I'm almost having to make myself vulnerable in that way just to see if the opportunity is even there for me,\u201d Ankney said.",
      "Landing a fully remote job can be competitive. \u201cThere are going to be many people that don\u2019t have the luxury just to leave\" their current jobs if they're required to return to the office, \"especially in a volatile market such as we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Attorney Holly Keerikatte was recently working on-site five days a week at a hospital, commuting about three hours a day and looking for a role that allowed more time with her family. She received two job offers. One was fully remote. The other paid 50% more but required a long commute. She recalled reading the phrase, \u201cThe only people who remember you worked late are your children.\u201d She chose the remote job.",
      "\u201cMy primary driver is what\u2019s best for my family,\u201d Keerikatte said. \u201cMy advice is to be up-front and transparent about what you want, what you\u2019re looking for and why.\"",
      "When faced with the inevitability of returning to an office, look for the positives. Friendships can blossom as colleagues take coffee breaks together or sample new lunch spots. In-person conversations can spark ideas that wouldn\u2019t surface at home.",
      "Employers can ease the transition by organizing activities that create camaraderie. For example, managers can put together a series of talks about the transition and have groups share what works for them, Dufrane said.",
      "Face-to-face contact allows people to better understand what colleagues are thinking and doing, which helps prevent resentment and can provide helpful feedback.",
      "Video director Deborah Ann DeSnoo, who owns Plug-In Inc., a video production company in Chofu, Japan, says she has worked in many countries where the film industry was male-dominated and female directors like her were uncommon. She makes a point to connect with colleagues in person, giving her a chance to bond.",
      "\u201cYou can read the air in a different way, and you find a solution,\u201d DeSnoo said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a Zoom and they ignore you, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",
      "TOKYO -- A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source.",
      "\u201cHow we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan\u2019s future growth,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.\u201d",
      "Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels.",
      "The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels.",
      "The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult.",
      "Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.",

      "Edmunds highlights five dream-worthy vehicles for holiday wish lists, focusing on models that are luxurious yet somewhat attainable",
      "Just about everyone dreams about cars they wish they could own, and there\u2019s no better time than the holidays to make a list of vehicles you\u2019d love to have in your driveway. The car pros at Edmunds rounded up five of their favorite dream-worthy vehicles. But rather than just list the most outlandish and expensive exotics, they focused on highlighting models that are expensive but not so pricey that it\u2019d be completely unrealistic for you to own one one day. The vehicles are ordered in ascending order of price and include destination fees.",
      "Off-road trucks look fantastic and are extremely capable. What truck enthusiast wouldn\u2019t have one topping their wish list? The king of the hill for 2025 is the F-150 Raptor R. The regular Raptor is already impressive, and the R takes it to the next level with a bonkers 720-horsepower supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine, upgraded Fox dual-value shock absorbers, and massive 37-inch all-terrain tires. An R-specific grille and hood are also part of the R\u2019s upgrades.",
      "Thankfully, the Raptor R isn\u2019t all bark and bite. It also has plenty of features to make it a livable truck for daily driving. Standard features include leather upholstery, cooling front seats, a premium sound system, and a surround-view camera to help make this big truck easier to park.",
      "Starting Price: $112,825",
      "Few sedans can match the Mercedes-Benz S-Class for opulence, luxury and prestige. This grand sedan showcases nearly every luxury, technology and performance innovation that Mercedes-Benz has concocted. Everything you touch inside is likely covered in leather, heated, or bathed in disco-worthy ambient light.",
      "A novel could be written about all of the S-Class\u2019 luxury and comfort features, but one of the most notable is the E-Active Body Control system. It scans the road surface ahead and adjusts the suspension to deliver the best ride possible. The S-Class also boasts an extensive list of advanced safety features and has an augmented reality head-up display that projects images that appear to float in front of the car. For the ultimate S-Class, get the 791-horsepower AMG S 63 E Performance model.",
      "Starting Price: $118,900",
      "Who needs a European exotic car when the Corvette ZR1 is just as capable? A sports car fanatic\u2019s wish list wouldn\u2019t be right without the ZR1. The new Corvette hit a record-setting top speed of 233 mph, making it the fastest car ever built by an American automaker and the fastest current production car priced under $1 million, according to Chevrolet.",
      "The top speed record was possible thanks to the ZR1\u2019s turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine that cranks out a staggering 1,064 horsepower. Its carbon-fiber aero package kept it glued to the track by generating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Chevrolet also says the ZR1 can accelerate through the quarter mile in less than 10 seconds. We expect the Corvette ZR1 to go on sale in early 2025.",
      "Estimated starting price: $150,000",
      "Does your wish list include a big and powerful SUV? If it does, the Escalade-V should top it. The big Caddy roars like a muscle car thanks to its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that churns out 682 horsepower and helps it hit 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. The Escalade-V also boasts enormous 24-inch wheels and large Brembo brakes that help bring the three-ton SUV to a stop.",
      "But the Escalade-V isn\u2019t only about brute power. It also has three rows of seating, plenty of cargo space and offers impressive tech like Super Cruise, a hands-free highway driving system, and an enormous 55-inch curved display that spans the dashboard.",
      "Starting Price: $161,990",
      "What if we told you there was a car that could outpace almost anything on a drag strip, keep up with high-end sports cars on a racetrack, and be comfortable enough for daily errands? Well, if that sounds amazing, add the Air Sapphire to your dream list.",
      "The Air Sapphire is a high-performance electric luxury sedan made by Lucid, an electric vehicle startup. It\u2019s one of the most powerful production cars in the world, producing an astonishing 1,234 horsepower from its three electric motors. Lucid says it has a top speed of 205 mph and can rocket to 60 mph in a mind-numbing 1.9 seconds. You can adjust the vehicle\u2019s setting for exceptional track performance or simply provide a comfortable ride around town.",
      "Starting price: $250,500",
      "Even if you can\u2019t afford any of these vehicles, you can still picture one sitting in your driveway or imagine yourself cruising around town in it. And who knows, maybe holiday magic will give you the opportunity to own one in the future.",

      "A task force led by Brazilian prosecutors says it has rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\u201d conditions at a construction site in northeastern Brazil, where Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is building a factory",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- A task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\" conditions at a construction site in northeastern Brazil, where Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is building a factory.",
      "On Tuesday, the Labor Prosecutor\u2019s Office released videos of the dorms where the construction workers were staying, which showed beds with no mattresses and rooms without any places for the workers to store their personal belongings.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said the workers had been hired in China by Jinjiang Construction Brazil, one of the contractors on the site, which is located in Cama\u00e7ari, a city in the Salvador metropolitan region.",
      "Officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated the workers' passports and held 60% of their wages. Those who quit would be forced to pay the company for their airfare from China, and for their return ticket, the statement said.",
      "Efforts to reach Jinjiang Construction in Brazil were unsuccessful as a contact phone number and email address were not immediately available.",
      "BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of electric cars. The company said on Monday night that it will \u201cimmediately terminate the contract\u201d with the Jinjian group and is \u201cstudying other appropriate measures.\u201d",
      "BYD said that the Jinjiang workers will be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and that they will not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been revising working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that \u201cadjustments\u201d had to be made.",
      "Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD\u2019s site in Cama\u00e7ari was especially critical, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up and get ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m.",
      "Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker\u2019s freedom of movement."

    "title": "Heavy travel day starts with brief grounding of all American Airlines flights",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 17:14:19 -0500",
    "summary": "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
    "story": [
      "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide Tuesday because of a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive.",
      "Government regulators cleared American flights to get airborne about an hour after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a national ground stop for the airline. The order, which prevented planes from taking off, was issued at the airline's request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system, or FOS. The airline blamed technology from one of its vendors.",
      "As a result, flights were delayed across American\u2019s major hubs, with only 37% of the airline's 3,901 domestic and international flights leaving on time, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Nineteen flights were canceled.",
      "Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing American Airlines pilots, said the airline told pilots at 7 a.m. Eastern that there was an outage affecting the FOS system. It handles different types of airline operations, including dispatch, flight planning, passenger boarding, as well as an airplane's weight and balance data, he said.",
      "Some components of FOS have gone down in the past, but a systemwide outage is rare, Tajer said.",
      "Hours after the ground stop was lifted, Tajer said the union had not heard about any \u201cchaos out there beyond just the normal heavy travel day.\u201d He said officials were watching for any cascading effects, such as staffing problems.",
      "On social media, however, customers expressed frustrations about delays that caused them or their family members to miss connecting flights. One person asked if American planned to hold flights for passengers to make connections, while others complained about the lack of assistance they said they received from the airline or gate agents.",
      "Cirium noted that the vast majority of flights were departing within two hours of their scheduled departure time. A similar percentage \u2014 36% \u2014 were arriving at their destinations as scheduled.",
      "Dallas-Fort Worth, New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport and Charlotte, North Carolina, saw the greatest number of delays, Cirium said. Washington, Chicago and Miami experienced considerably fewer delays.",
      "Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 4,058 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed, with 76 flights canceled. The site had not posted any American Airlines flights on Tuesday morning, but showed in the afternoon that 961 American flights were delayed.",
      "Amid the travel problems, significant rain and snow were expected in the Pacific Northwest at least into Christmas Day. Showers and thunderstorms were developing in the South. Freezing rain was reported in the Mid-Atlantic region near Baltimore and Washington, and snow fell in New York.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier\u2019s flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline tends to be expensive.",
      "An American spokesperson said Tuesday was not a peak travel day for the airline \u2014 with about 2,000 fewer flights than the busiest days \u2014 so the airline had somewhat of a buffer to manage the delays.",
      "The groundings happened as millions of travelers were expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers through Jan. 2.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations more disruptive than during slower periods. Even with just a brief outage, the cancellations have a cascading effect that can take days to clear up.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.04 a gallon, down from $3.13 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",

    "summary": "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Half of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. Two lawsuits related to that law have been filed so far.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "summary": "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to President Joe Biden, who opposes the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March. He has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is giving up Nippon Steel's potential investments in the mills and upgrades that might help preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "Under the terms of the proposed $14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steelmakers in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \u201cblock this deal from happening.\u201d He proposed reviving U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \u201cthrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\u201d",
      "The steelworkers union questions if Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\u201cOur union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it\u2019s up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\u201d David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \u201cis the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it had been informed by CFIUS that it had referred the case to Biden, and urged him to \u201creflect on the great lengths that we have gone to to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U. S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that our transaction should and will be approved if it is fairly evaluated on its merits,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "A growing number of conservatives have publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and officials in areas near its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America\u2019s manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement to protect national security.",
      "Congress significantly expanded the committee's powers through the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Biden issued an executive order broadening the factors the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how they impact the U.S. supply chain or if they put Americans\u2019 personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel has factories in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world\u2019s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "The strike, which began Friday in Los Angeles, Chicago and Starbucks' hometown of Seattle, spread Monday to stores in Boston, Dallas and Portland, Ore. Workers in New York, Denver, Pittsburgh and other cities had also joined the strike over the weekend.",
      "Workers are protesting a lack of progress in contract negotiation with the company. Starbucks Workers United, which began the unionization effort in 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year.",
      "The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. Since 2021, baristas at 535 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to join the union.",
      "The strike comes at one of the busiest times of the year for Starbucks. But the company said Monday it has had \u201cno significant impact\u201d to its store operations. Starbucks has around 10,000 company-operated stores in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe respect our partners\u2019 right to engage in lawful strike activity, and we appreciate the thousands of partners across the country who are continuing to support each other and deliver the Starbucks experience for our customers,\" the company said Monday in a statement.",
      "The two side have been bargaining since the spring but appear to have reached an impasse over economic issues. Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of 1.5% or more for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",
      "Starbucks said its U.S. baristas make an average of $18 per hour. With benefits \u2014 including health care, free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 Starbucks\u2019 pay package is worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week, the company said.",
      "Workers say they deserve more, and note that Starbucks' new Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job."

      "Rajinder Singh Minhas, 60, of Rochester, Michigan, was arrested and arraigned last week on charges of falsely altering a public record, substantial endangerment to the public, discharge of injurious substance to waters of the state, false statements and omissions regarding air pollution control and other charges, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Monday.",

      "Government safety regulators said Monday they have closed an investigation into two previous recalls of the Ford Focus after determining that Ford Motor Co. has satisfied its concerns.",
      "In 2018, Ford recalled around 1.5 million Ford Focus sedans from the 2012-2018 model years because they could lose power. The issue was a malfunctioning canister purge valve and software that didn\u2019t adequately detect when it was stuck open. If the valve was stuck open, excessive vacuum could build up in the fuel management system and deform the fuel tank.",
      "Five crashes and two injuries were reported related to the issue, but no fatalities.",

    "story": [
      "A biologist hid 350 audio monitors across Costa Rica\u2019s tropical rainforests to spy on endangered spider monkeys in order to help protect them",
      "PUERTO JIM\u00c9NEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey\u2019s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.",
      "So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.",
      "The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.",
      "Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world\u2019s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.",
      "More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can \u201chandle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies\u201d that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.",
      "Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.",
      "\u201cThose remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.",
      "Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.",
      "Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation \u2014 and efforts to reverse it \u2014 is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.",
      "Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be \u201copen-sourced\u201d to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.",
      "\u201cShe basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,\u201d said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim C\u00f3rdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.",
      "Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica \u2014 spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cThe spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there\u2019s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.\u201d",
      "The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.",
      "After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared \u2014 peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again \u2014 extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.",
      "Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.",
      "Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.",
      "Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re reducing our influence on their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd also \u2014 they don\u2019t want us here.\"",

    "summary": "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a &ldquo;total failure.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy \u201cmoonscape\u201d unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents.",
      "That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed.",
      "A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.",
      "There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water.",
      "Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on.",
      "\u201cWe bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,\u201d said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. \u201cNo way to survive with our children again.\u201d",
      "Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries.",
      "After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role.",
      "To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground.",
      "But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a \u201ccomplete absence of topsoil\u201d and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits.",
      "The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP.",
      "The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents \u201cbaseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful.",
      "But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief.",
      "A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites.",
      "They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups.",
      "In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep\u2019s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites.",
      "Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained.",
      "Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests.",
      "In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab\u2019s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice.",
      "Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to.",
      "The U.N. cited another problem \u2014 contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a \u201cblank check,\u201d U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell.",
      "The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cdemonized for doing their job.\u201d Shekwolo\u2019s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and \u201cphysically prevented\u201d auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment.",
      "Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to \u201ccorrect the identified weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria\u2019s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako\u2019s office declined an interview.",
      "Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep\u2019s alleged failings and determined to address them.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proper remediation being done,\u201d she told the AP in a phone interview. \u201cThe companies had no competence whatsoever.\u201d",
      "In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of \u201csignificant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,\u201d in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians.",
      "The \u201cmajority\u201d of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies \u201cwouldn\u2019t get the big jobs.\u201d",
      "One of Shekwolo\u2019s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo\u2019s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of.",
      "When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies.",
      "\u201cThat sent shockwaves around the political class,\u201d said Ikeazor. \u201cThey all had interests.\"",
      "\"That was when the battle started,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months.",
      "Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn\u2019t like him.",
      "Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June.",
      "Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn\u2019t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization.",
      "Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on.",

Jackson Arnold returned to the starting role the final five regular-season games. But Arnold then left in the portal to go to Auburn.",
      "Oklahoma: While the Sooners played in a bowl for the 26th consecutive season, they had 23 winning seasons in a row before Venables took over as head coach. ... Hawkins was hampered by at least six dropped passes while throwing to a group whose only scholarship receivers were freshmen.",

      "When Snoop Dogg agreed to become the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl, he had a demand: It must have a NIL component",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The new contract runs though the 2029-30 season, and validates what the Avalanche expected out of Blackwood in solidifying their goaltending upon acquiring the 28-year-old in a trade with San Jose on Dec. 9. Blackwood has gone 3-1 since the trade with a 2.03 goals-against average and .931 save percentage.",
      "\u201cWhen we acquired Mackenzie a few weeks ago, we wanted to let him get to Denver, get acclimated to his new team, new city and then in due time we\u2019d reach out to him and his representatives,\u201d general manager Chris MacFarland said in a statement released by the team. \u201cAs I said when we acquired him, we feel like Mackenzie has just gotten better and better every year and he has come in and done a great job with us in his first few starts. He\u2019s a big body, athletic goaltender who is still young and still growing as a goaltender.\u201d",
      "Blackwood shined in his Avalanche debut with 37 saves in a 5-2 win over Nashville, in becoming just fourth NHL goalie to stop at least that many shots in his first game with a franchise. He\u2019s yet to allow more than two goals in each of his four starts with Colorado, and improved his season record to 9-10-3.",
      "Blackwood is completing the second year of a two-year contract, and is on his third NHL team after spending his first five seasons in New Jersey. The Devils' second-round pick in 2015, he was the second goalie chosen in that year's draft.",
      "Overall, Blackwood has an 84-92-25 record with 11 shutouts and a 3.05 goals-against average in 219 career games.",
      "The Avalanche have completely reshuffled their goaltending tandem by also acquiring Scott Wedgewood in a trade with Nashville on Nov. 30.",
      "The two newcomers have provided stability in net for a team that was allowing 3.71 goals per outing through its first 24 games in opening the season with goalies Alexandar Georgiev and rookie Justus Annunen.",
      "Georgiev was dealt to San Jose along with a 2026 second-round pick and rookie forward Nikolai Kovalenko in the trade to acquire Blackwood. Annunen was swapped in the trade with Nashville.",
      "The Avalanche (21-15), who play at Utah on Friday, are 8-3 and allowing an average 2.45 goals in the month of December while making the jump from ninth to sixth in the Western Conference standings.",

He's a guy who's always gonna be upbeat. He's always going to fight. He has one way about him, and that's what I love about him. I think we're very, very much the same in that way. We just go.

      "CHICAGO -- The defense delivered for the Chicago Bears. It was one of the team's best performances of the season on that side of the ball.",
      "Just not good enough.",
      "\u201cI guess we should have held them to three points or zero points at the end of the day,\u201d safety Kevin Byard said.",
      "Byard and Co. shut down Seattle on Thursday night, limiting Geno Smith and the Seahawks to 265 yards and Jason Myers' two field goals. But Chicago finished with just 179 yards of offense in a 6-3 loss.",
      "The Bears (4-12) became the first NFL team to lose when allowing six points or fewer since the Raiders fell 3-0 loss to the Vikings on Dec. 10, 2023. It was the fourth time in the last 90 seasons that the franchise lost a game when allowing six points or fewer, joining a 6-3 loss to Tampa Bay on Oct. 24, 1999, a 6-3 loss to Denver on Dec. 5, 1971, and a 3-0 loss to the New York Giants on Nov. 17, 1935.",
      "The defense was expected to help carry the team in its first season since it selected quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But it had struggled of late, contributing to a 10-game losing streak since a 4-2 start.",
      "Chicago had allowed an average of 31 points and 422.6 yards of offense over its previous five games.",
      "\u201cOur defense has a certain standard, and we've showed it,\u201d defensive back Kyler Gordon said. \u201cObviously sinking a little bit; just getting back on the guys to obviously get back right. It's just important to know what we can do. Just go in there and execute. We did way better today.\u201d",
      "Gordon made a big play with Chicago trailing 6-3 late in the third quarter, stripping Pharaoh Brown at the end of a 4-yard reception. Gordon emerged from a pile of players with the ball and started running up the field. He was briefly chased by Tyler Lockett, before the receiver turned back in confusion about what had happened.",
      "It was originally called a 62-yard fumble return for a touchdown, but a replay official ruled Gordon was down at the Chicago 38.",
      "\u201cApparently someone touched my leg,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI don't know. They got to show me a replay before I believe it.\u201d",
      "Chicago had one first down before Williams was sacked for a 14-yard loss and the drive stalled.",
      "Seattle had a chance to put the game away in the fourth. Smith passed to DK Metcalf for 23 yards to move the Seahawks out to their own 40. But Smith's third-and-6 pass to Zach Charbonnet gained just 2 yards and Seattle punted the ball back to Chicago with about five minutes left.",
      "The Bears sacked Smith three times, and the Seahawks went 5 for 13 on third down.",
      "\u201cI think we played our brand of ball today,\u201d Byard said. \u201cGuys flew around. Ky got the turnover. Wanted to get a little bit more, but I think we flew around. We played hard. We know we're a resilient group, but I just think that the execution was a lot better.\u201d",

      "If Jimmy Butler wants a trade, the Miami Heat have no plans to make him happy",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- If Jimmy Butler wants a trade, the Miami Heat have no plans to make him happy.",
      "Heat President Pat Riley \u2014 in a rare move \u2014 spoke out to address rumors Thursday, saying the team has no plans to trade Butler. It's a clear sign that, if necessary, the team will be willing to let Butler leave as a free agent and get nothing in return.",
      "\u201cWe usually don\u2019t comment on rumors, but all this speculation has become a distraction to the team and is not fair to the players and coaches,\" Riley said in a release distributed by the team. \"Therefore, we will make it clear \u2014 we are not trading Jimmy Butler.\u201d",
      "The Heat play in Orlando on Thursday. Butler did not fly with the team to Orlando on Wednesday night, and his intentions for future games seem a bit unclear as well.",
      "Butler has not asked the Heat for a trade, but ESPN, citing sources it did not name, reported Wednesday that the six-time All-Star wants a trade by the league\u2019s Feb. 6 deadline and is open to joining teams such as Phoenix, Golden State, Houston and Dallas.",
      "\u201cYou have to compartmentalize in this business,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Thursday at the team's morning shootaround in Orlando. \u201cWe want Jimmy here. There\u2019s no ifs, ands or buts about it. And it\u2019s just unfortunate that you have to control or deal with a lot of the noise on the outside.\u201d",
      "Butler, to be fair, has fueled some of the noise.",
      "The primary colors of his reportedly preferred teams include orange, yellow, red and blue. Butler\u2019s hair, perhaps not coincidentally, has been tinged in those colors at times in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI actually like it,\u201d Butler said earlier this month when asked about being linked to trade talks and speculation. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be talked about. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as bad publicity \u2014 to a point.\u201d",
      "Miami, if it doesn\u2019t trade Butler, would run the risk of potentially losing him for nothing as a free agent next summer. He's making $49 million this season and has a player option for $52 million next season.",
      "Riley's statement is another development in a long-running saga involving Butler\u2019s future with the Heat, one that began picking up steam back in May when Riley was noncommittal about giving Butler an extension over the summer.",
      "Butler is eligible for an extension that would guarantee him $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons. But he is 35 and misses, on average, about one out of every four games in his Heat tenure.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who\u2019s going to be there and available every single night,\u201d Riley said in May. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d",
      "Butler twisted an ankle in Miami\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City on Friday but missed the remainder of that game and the next two Heat games \u2014 at Orlando last Saturday and against Brooklyn on Monday \u2014 with illness, not the ankle, cited as the reason.",
      "Butler has helped Miami make the NBA Finals twice in his Heat tenure. He is averaging 18.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists this season.",

    "story": [
      "The Detroit Red Wings have fired coach Derek Lalonde and named Todd McLellan as his replacement",
      "The Detroit Red Wings fired coach Derek Lalonde on Thursday and named Todd McLellan as his replacement, a major change by general manager Steve Yzerman more than a third of the way through another disappointing season in the place known as \u201cHockeytown.\u201d",
      "The move the day after Christmas comes with the Red Wings on a three-game skid and having lost nine of their past 12. They've lost 21 of their first 34 games this season and are above only the lowly Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference.",
      "Lalonde was nearly midway through his third season with Detroit after winning the Stanley Cup twice as an assistant with Tampa Bay. Yzerman inherited Jeff Blashill as coach when he left the Lightning for the Red Wings in 2019 and hired Lalonde in the summer of 2022 with the goal of getting the team back in the playoffs.",
      "Despite signing three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Kane in 2023 and re-signing him last offseason, the success has not approached the Red Wings\u2019 glory days when they won the Cup four times between 1996-97 and 2007-08 \u2014 three times with Yzerman as captain and once with him working in the front office. Instead, their playoff drought is on track to reach a ninth year \u2014 second-longest in the league behind Buffalo.",
      "Associate coach Bob Boughner was also fired and Trent Yawney hired to work on McLellan\u2019s staff as an assistant. McLellan signed a multiyear contract to start his fourth NHL head coaching job after stints with San Jose, Edmonton and Los Angeles.",
      "McLellan, 57, coached his team to the playoffs in nine of the 14 full seasons he was in charge behind the bench. He returns to the Motor City after getting his first job in the league as a Red Wings assistant in 2005 and serving under coach Mike Babcock on the 2008 title run.",
      "The Melville, Saskatchewan, native was hired by the Sharks just after and led them on three trips to the West final. Most recently, McLellan was fired by the Kings in February during the All-Star break and interviewed for other vacancies since.",
      "This is the fourth coaching change around the NHL this season and 15th this calendar year, counting Rick Bowness' retirement in Winnipeg. The Boston Bruins in November fired Jim Montgomery, who was hired by the St. Louis Blues less than a week later, and the Chicago Blackhawks replaced Luke Richardson with Anders Sorensen in early December.",

      "City dropped more points Thursday in its improbably poor run of form by drawing 1-1 at home to Everton, with Haaland having a spot kick saved by England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the 53rd minute.",
      "The four-time defending champions have only won one of its last 13 games in all competitions and manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged he needs to spend in the January transfer window to reverse City's slide.",
      "\u201cThe transfer window in the winter is not easy, but even the players know that we have to add some new players,\u201d said Guardiola, who has had to cope without a host of key players, including Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, through injury this season.",
      "While City is languishing in seventh place, United is even further adrift in 14th place after a 2-0 loss at lowly Wolverhampton.",
      "United played almost the whole of the second half with 10 men after Fernandes collected his second yellow card in the 47th minute. It was the United captain's third sending-off of the season, though one was rescinded.",
      "Second-place Chelsea also dropped points after conceding in the fifth minute of stoppage time to lose 2-1 at home to Fulham, giving Liverpool the chance to extend its lead to seven points by beating Leicester later.",
      "Nottingham Forest won 1-0 against Tottenham to go up to third, while there were also victories for Newcastle and West Ham. Sixth-place Bournemouth drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace.",
      "City secured only its fifth point in the league since the end of October but that will be scant consolation to Guardiola, whose beleaguered team squandered a winning position after going ahead through Bernardo Silva\u2019s deflected shot in the 14th. Iliman Ndiaye equalized in the 36th.",
      "Haaland\u2019s penalty failure means the Norway international has only scored once in his last seven games. He headed in from the rebound after his spot kick, but the goal was ruled out for offside.",
      "Haaland, who last week admitted his form had not been good enough during a run that has seen City\u2019s season unravel, held his head in his hands after his failure to score from the spot. He still has 18 goals in 25 appearances this season, but has not scored in a win for his club since the 1-0 victory against Southampton on Oct. 26.",
      "\u201cWe shoot a lot in the 18-yard box, but unfortunately we could not get the results that we wanted,\u201d Guardiola said.",
      "City\u2019s damaging run has seen it slip down the standings in the league and crash out of the English League Cup. It is also in danger of missing out on the playoffs for the round of 16 in the Champions League \u2014 sitting just one point above the cut-off point with two games to play.",
      "Wolves' first goal against United came direct from a corner, with Brazil striker Matheus Cunha seeing his kick curl over the head of goalkeeper Andre Onana and into the far corner in the 58th minute.",
      "Such goals are rare, though United also conceded from a corner in its 4-3 loss to Tottenham in the English League Cup this month. Son Heung-min scored on that occasion.",
      "Wolves added a second through Hwang Hee-chan in the ninth minute of stoppage time and have won two straight games since Vitor Pereira was hired to replace Gary O'Neil. Cunha has 10 goals of the season.",
      "Chelsea dropped points for the second time in as many games, with Enzo Maresca's team drawing 0-0 at Everton last week.",
      "The Blues gave up a lead earned by Cole Palmer in the 16th as Harry Wilson equalized in the 82nd and Rodrigo Muniz grabbed the late winner for Fulham, which won at Stamford Bridge for the first time in 45 years.",
      "Arsenal can now jump from fourth to second with a win against Ipswich on Friday.",
      "Forest's remarkable season shows little sign of slowing down after Anthony Elanga's winner against Tottenham at the City Ground. Forest is a point behind Chelsea in third.",
      "Villa was already a goal down to Newcastle after Anthony Gordon's strike in the second minute when Jhon Duran was sent off in the 32nd. Alexander Isak and Joelinton added goals for the hosts",
      "West Ham had to cope with first-half injuries to defender Max Kilman and goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, but still won 1-0 at Southampton after Jarrod Bowen's goal in the 59th.",

      "Bates used his platform as an NFL player to spread his love of Jesus in\u202f a prime-time interview on NBC \u202fafter lifting the Lions to a win over the Texans with a 52-yard field goal as time expired.",
      "A month later, Bates told The Associated Press it is a duty to share his Christian faith.",

Recently, for example, Jake Retzlaff became the first Jewish quarterback to play for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has embraced his role as an ambassador of Judaism in football.",

      "The one week of the year where golf tours around the world go silent is always a good time to reflect on some of the tales from the tours",
      "Scottie Scheffler won a lot of tournaments and had to do a lot of talking this year. One theme stood out even as Scheffler was dominating his competition by winning nine times.",
      "The answer could be found on a white board in Paris.",
      "Golfers at the Olympics were asked to write their nicknames, countries, favorite Olympic sports and their goal in Paris. Most of the players said their goal was gold, or at least to win a medal.",
      "Scheffler wrote: Have fun.",
      "He shot 62 in the final round and won the gold medal. That was fun. In fact, from Kapalua in January to being voted PGA Tour player of the year in December, Scheffler used some form of the word \u201cfun\u201d 183 times in news conferences.",
      "It was like that for a lot of people in the world of golf, who created memories that make this year's edition of \u201cTales from the Tour.\u201d",
      "Tommy Fleetwood came to The Sentry on Maui for the first time and brought his father from England. Peter Fleetwood sat in a cart watching his son on the practice range and soaking up the weather in paradise, his first trip to Hawaii.",
      "Being a popular vacation spot, it led to a question about where they used to go to relax.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t take holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford them. We went around to junior golf tournaments in the summer. That was our holidays. And that was good.\u201d",
      "There was a quiet contentment about him as he watched his son, now one of the top players and characters in the sport. The father resumed his thoughts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a great life. I have nothing to complain about,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my wife a few years ago and I complain about that. But nothing else. I had everything I ever needed.\u201d",
      "The season opener can be a good tone-setter, and it's not always measure by a scorecard.",
      "All the attention on money includes the caddies.",
      "Xander Schauffele and Austin Kaiser were teammates at San Diego State and close friends ever since. Kaiser was working in a warehouse when Schauffele asked if he would caddie for him. They got their PGA Tour card in 2017, the first win, and before long Schauffele was a mainstay among the top 10 in the world ranking.",
      "Kaiser wasn\u2019t doing too bad, either.",
      "The standard fee for many caddies is 10% for a win. With $20 million purses, it adds up. Schauffele was discussing this at Bay Hill when he looked over at Kaiser and told him, \u201cYou get paid too much.\u201d",
      "Kaiser didn't blink.",
      "\u201cYeah, but you're the (expletive) paying me,\u201d he replied.",
      "Both broke out laughing. Some four months later, they had two major championships. Money well spent.",
      "The U.S. Open was approaching and Jack Nicklaus was asked what he thought about the toughest test in golf giving up a pair of 62s the previous year at Los Angeles Country Club. His thoughts instead turned to the course, which he had not seen in some time.",
      "\u201cI played it in 1954, the U.S. Junior. I was 14 years old,\u201d Nicklaus. \u201cI got beat in the second round. I think Hugh Royer Jr. beat me.\u201d",
      "Think about it. This is an 84-year-old who has competed at more than 1,000 tournaments since he was a boy. How can he remember losing 70 years ago to someone named Hugh Royer?",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you,\" Nicklaus added with a smile, \"but I think it was 5-and-3.\u201d",
      "That afternoon came a phone call on another matter to Michael Trostel, the great USGA resource on history. He had a U.S. Junior Amateur record book near him and was asked to look up 1954 at LA Country Club. How did Nicklaus fare?",
      "\u201cLooks like he lost in the second round ... to Hugh Royer Jr.,\u201d Trostel replied.",
      "The score?",
      "\u201cHold on ... 4 and 3,\" he said.",
      "Nicklaus rarely misses, and when he does, it's not by much.",
      "Nelly Korda had high hopes for the U.S. Women\u2019s Open and so did everyone else. She had tied an LPGA record with five straight wins, one of them was a major. She was a big favorite at the biggest tournament in women's golf.",
      "For two holes, anyway.",
      "On her third hole, the par-3 12th at Lancaster, Korda after a long wait hit her 6-iron long into a bunker. She blasted out to a severely sloped green and watched it roll off the front and into a stream. Her next chip from the other side of the stream wasn\u2019t strong enough and went in the water. So did the one after that.",
      "It was a horror show unfolding before her eyes \u2014 and the eyes of her swing coach. Because of the long wait, Jamie Mulligan and had gone up to the grandstands.",
      "After the third ball found the water, Mulligan quietly said, \u201cThis is kind of tough to watch.\u201d",
      "She made 10.",
      "Mulligan, however, didn\u2019t lose his sense of humor, one of the reasons they mesh so well. An acquaintance sitting next to Mulligan found a reason to head back toward the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cI need to find her manager to get more golf balls,\u201d he said.",
      "Steve Stricker accepted the award. His daughter called the shots.",
      "Stricker easily won the Golf Writers Association of America award as the senior player of the year after a blockbuster 2023 season of six wins, three of them majors. It was a festive night at the awards dinner. The only question was whether Stricker would get emotional.",
      "It started when he approached the podium, partly because Gary Woodland got everyone emotional with heartfelt gratitude returning from brain surgery.",
      "Stricker rallied, his voice still a little unsteady, but the message was back on track.",
      "\u201cIf he looks at my mom he\u2019s going to lose it,\u201d his oldest daughter, Bobbi, whispered from her seat in the auditorium.",
      "Stricker spoke of his special year and said he wanted to thank his family. That\u2019s when he turned to look at them and it was over. He went seven full seconds before he could get out another word. Amid the tears, he laughed at himself.",
      "It\u2019s what makes him so endearing to so many.",
      "Justin Thomas made a solid recovery this year, but he couldn\u2019t afford a bad week at the BMW Championship. And he was having a rough week with his putting at Castle Pines.",
      "Thomas was 49th in the key putting statistic going into the third round. He was on the practice green with his father when he mentioned where he ranked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone putting worse than me this week.\u201d",
      "Mike Thomas had to deliver the bad news \u2014 Hideki Matsuyama had withdrawn, and there were only 49 players left in the field.",
      "The good news for Thomas? He made just enough over the weekend to finish 30th place in the FedEx Cup and get back to the Tour Championship.",
      "Scheffler won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. His caddie, Ted Scott, also received a medal and was never prouder.",
      "Since 2008, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has given American medalists the \u201cOrder of Ikkos\u201d medallion to present to a key member of their team, usually a coach.",
      "For Scheffler, it was an easy choice.",
      "He spoke after the second round about struggling with his attitude and how his caddie helped him. Scott later filled in the details.",
      "It was on the eighth hole, after Scheffler made double bogey from a bad lie in the fairway.",
      "\u201cI called him off the side of the green and I had a stern talking to him,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI just said, 'I want you to look into my eyes, listen to my words and don\u2019t talk back.\u2019\u201d",
      "The message that followed was for Scheffler not to overcomplicate his game or overreact. The mission going forward was to commit to the shot and accept the outcome.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019You might make everything at the end of the tournament. You don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see what happens,'\u201d Scott said.",
      "He made everything at the end, a 29 on the back nine won the gold medal. He showered Scott was more praise than usual when it was over.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a pro look me in the eyes and say he couldn\u2019t do it without me,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was special.\u201d",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Gary Player is a big believer that one can't go through life without love. Even at age 89, he's never too old to find it. Player happily shared his big news at the PNC Championship.",
      "He has a new girlfriend.",
      "\u201cI said I wanted to live until 100. Now if I live to 91, I'll be happy,\u201d Player said with a laugh. \u201cIsn't that amazing that at 89 you can find a girlfriend? She loves everything I love \u2014 golf, fishing, gym work, reading, opera, everything.\u201d",
      "Her name is Susan Waterfall, she lives in New York and she's 83. Player's wife, Vivienne, died in 2021. They had been married for 64 years.",
      "Player said he wasn't searching. Friends approached him during a fundraiser at Leopard Creek in South Africa about a woman he should meet. It never happened. He was in New York for a golf course design when someone else brought up her name. Again, they never connected. Then he was invited to be an honorary member for a new golf course in Miami, where memberships go for about $1.3 million.",
      "\u201cI'm on the putting green and this lady comes up and says, \u2018I\u2019m Susan Waterfall. Everyone has been trying to introduce us,'\u201d Player said. \u201cI put my arm around her \u2014 she's gorgeous \u2014 and I said, \u2018I love this country, America, so much. I\u2019ve got to have an American girlfriend.' She blushes, doesn't say anything. So I said, \u2018Will you come to dinner with me?\u2019\u201d",
      "He called her two days later in New York \u2014 he says she stepped out of a board meeting to take his call \u2014 and they headed to Gleneagles in Scotland to go fishing.",
      "\u201cShe's very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Listen, Susan, I don\u2019t need your money. I'm also rich. You don't need my money. But if you die before me, you can leave me a little.'\u201d",
      "Nelly Korda is celebrating part of Christmas a little early because younger brother Sebastian is headed Down Under for the Australian Open tennis tournament. And then she\u2019s off to the mountains for a little ... dog sledding?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for that, something I\u2019ve never done,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI love the mountains, I love snow and so I\u2019m super excited for that to recharge my batteries. I skied as a kid, but I do not ski now. I\u2019m already fragile enough.\u201d",

      "The made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek brought PGA Tour stars Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy against LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. It was under the lights at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. It was billed as the PGA Tour vs. LIV, just what golf fans wanted.",
      "But according to Sports Business Journal, the 16-hole match (Scheffler and McIlroy won handily) drew only 625,000 viewers across two networks on TNT and TBS on a Tuesday night.",
      "Sports Business Journal said that put it as the second-lowest viewership for \u201cThe Match\u201d series.",
      "One of those viewers was Fred Couples, but not until the fifth hole.",
      "\u201cI did not know it was on,\u201d Couples said. He only realized it when his longtime caddie, Joe LaCava, sent him a text and \u201cI don't even need to say what the text about.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was pitch dark and freezing. Now, I don\u2019t know why they would do that, to play a match that big. ... But I thought it was fun,\u201d Couples said. \u201cI just ... we just didn't get the pitch dark. It was just weird.\u201d",

The 125-year-old WGA, which runs the BMW Championship, said the tournament at Castle Pines in Colorado raised a record $10.2 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation.",

The Epson Tour has announced a 20-tournament schedule for 2025 that includes three new tournaments and total prize money of $5 million. ... Fred Couples says he has been asked to introduce players on the first tee when the Skins Game returns next year on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Couples was known as \u201cMr. Skins\u201d during the event's peak years. Couples made nearly $4.5 million \u2014 back when $4.5 million meant something \u2014 in 11 appearances. ... The TMRW Golf League that starts next month is going worldwide before a shot has been struck into the monstrous screen in SoFi Center. It has agreements for Canal+ to show matches live in France and sub-Saharan Africa, while Disney+ has secured rights to show them exclusively in the five Nordic countries.

      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander",
      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Milwaukee has the NBA's leading scorer in Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were the teams that made their way to the NBA Cup final.",
      "By any measure, they're both very good teams.",
      "And neither will play on Christmas Day this year. Bah, humbug.",
      "In its defense, the NBA faces the same challenge every summer, figuring out which 10 teams will get the honor \u2014 and it is an honor \u2014 of playing on Christmas Day.",
      "The Knicks and Lakers almost always find their way onto the slate, which makes sense given the size of the New York and Los Angeles media markets. The teams coming off runs to the NBA Finals typically get a Christmas invite, so hello, Boston and Dallas. The rest is a mix of stars, ratings potential, storylines and, hopefully, good teams.",
      "Victor Wembanyama \u2014 the French star who already is a massive draw both in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 makes his Christmas debut when San Antonio goes to New York. Minnesota plays Dallas in a West finals rematch. Boston plays Philadelphia, a forever rivalry. The Lakers play Golden State, LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry. And Denver plays Phoenix in the nightcap. Nobody could have said those games were Christmas mistakes when the schedule came out.",
      "It's also a sign of the parity in the NBA right now \u2014 there are clearly more than 10 teams worthy of Christmas consideration. That said, the Thunder and Bucks certainly have the right to feel snubbed.",
      "\u201cWe should\u2019ve had a Christmas day game, I believe, but the NBA felt different,\u201d Bucks guard Khris Middleton said on media day, back in September. \u201cThat\u2019s how they feel. I said my opinion on it. And sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The Thunder not getting picked is puzzling, especially after being the No. 1 seed in the West last season.",
      "This is the 17th consecutive season of the NBA having five games on Christmas Day. More often than not \u2014 75% of the time \u2014 the No. 1 seeds for the East and West playoffs have been picked for a Christmas game the following season. And entering this year, each of the previous 11 No. 1 seeds in the West playoffs wound up having a game on Dec. 25 that same year.",
      "But not the Thunder.",
      "\u201cDisappointed, for sure,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cI'd love to play on Christmas Day. And I think we're that caliber of team. The NBA makes their decisions. Can't slight them for it. Ball's in our court to prove to them why we deserve to be in that game.\u201d",
      "There have been reasons for some of the eight No. 1 seeds who got snubbed in that span to get snubbed. Some examples:",
      "\u2014 Cleveland was the East's No. 1 seed in 2010. LeBron James left Cleveland that summer and went to Miami, and the Cavaliers became a far-less-marketable team overnight so putting them on the Christmas schedule wouldn't have made much sense.",
      "\u2014 Indiana was the East's No. 1 seed in 2014. Paul George got hurt badly while playing for USA Basketball that summer and the Pacers weren't the same the following the season, which the schedule-makers probably realized could happen.",
      "\u2014 Toronto was the East's No. 1 seed in 2018. Toronto didn't make the Christmas list a few months later for the simple reason that the Raptors are from Canada, and Canadian viewers don't count in American television ratings. (The then-reigning NBA champion Raptors made the Christmas lineup in 2019.)",
      "None of those situations would apply to the Thunder.",
      "Oklahoma City is a small market, sure. Only Memphis and New Orleans are smaller among NBA cities in the U.S., according to Nielsen. It's easy to deduce that national ratings play a part in the decision of who plays on Christmas and who doesn't, but it's also clear that those who just want to see good ball on Dec. 25 probably would have tuned in for a Thunder game.",
      "\u201cThey make the schedule. We play it,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cOur players, I know, would have liked to play on Christmas because that's such a staple day in the NBA season. But we can't control that. All we can control is playing the schedule we're given, playing the hand we're dealt.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than my non-existent cartilage,\u201d said Vonn, one of the most successful skiers of all time with 82 World Cup wins. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of skiers already about it and I really think that it could be something that should be considered.",
      "\u201cI feel amazing. I mean, obviously not everyone responds the same way to surgeries. For some reason, I bounce back pretty well from surgery. But I think it\u2019s something to seriously consider for athletes that have a lot of knee problems.\u201d",
      "Andrea Panzeri, the Italian Winter Sports Federation\u2019s head physician and an orthopedist who has operated numerous times on Vonn\u2019s good friend and fellow downhiller, Sofia Goggia, said knee replacements are usually performed on patients older than 50.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely the first time in World Cup history that such a young athlete has raced with one,\" Panzeri told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not aware of any other elite-level athletes in other sports competing with one, either.\u201d",
      "Panzeri performs knee replacements. But he had never even thought about doing one on a World Cup skier \u2014 until he saw Vonn competing with one.",
      "\u201cPartial prosthetics, like the half-knee ones, are definitely the ones that offer the best performance and we\u2019re seeing that (with Vonn),\" Panzeri said. \u201cI don\u2019t think her decision is going to change pro sports. But it could provide more motivation for so-called \u2018normal\u2019 people to try a prosthetic.\"",
      "Three-time Grand Slam tennis champion Andy Murray played with an artificial hip at the end of his career. Vonn\u2019s former skiing teammate Julia Mancuso also redid her hip a few months after she retired in 2018 and maintains an active lifestyle.",
      "\u201cI, for sure, would have considered a comeback if I didn\u2019t have kids,\" Mancuso told The AP recently. \"So I can totally relate to Lindsey.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said that \u201chips have different biomechanics than a knee and many more people are able to play sports with a hip prosthetic than a knee prosthetic.\"",
      "Elan Goldwaser, a sports medicine physician at Columbia University Medical Center who works with the U.S. Ski Team, has seen many athletes come to his clinic for knee replacements but not elite-level competitors.",
      "So, is Vonn\u2019s operation going to be a trend-setter in skiing?",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the go-to like in baseball with Tommy John surgery,\u201d Goldwaser said in St. Moritz. \u201cBut if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s a good procedure to do.\u201d",
      "Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach, said they had questions over whether her titanium knee would hold up to the forces required to navigate downhill skiing turns at 80 mph (130 kph) as she hurls herself down steep mountains.",
      "\u201cThere was not a lot of research out there with high-level athletes and partial knee replacements,\" Knight said. \u201cIt is a new frontier. But so far everything\u2019s working really well... And I would not be surprised if other people do it because the results that Lindsey\u2019s had, with no pain and no swelling, have been unbelievable.",
      "\u201cGranted, she stayed in great shape the entire time she hasn\u2019t been racing. So, that probably helped. I mean, if you\u2019re sitting around as a non-active skier and not doing anything with your fitness, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as effective. But if you\u2019re an athlete who\u2019s got some knee problems, from what I\u2019m seeing, I wouldn\u2019t be saying no to them.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s new knee also left an impression on U.S. Ski Team head coach Paul Kristofic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely due for one myself,\u201d Kristofic said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her.\"",
      "Still, there are doubters.",
      "Four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen told Swiss tabloid Blick last week that \u201cthere is a risk that Vonn will tear her artificial knee to pieces.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said the titanium does not rupture.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small prosthetic that doesn\u2019t break.\u201d",
      "Vonn will race next in St. Anton, Austria, Jan. 11-12.",

      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

    "summary": "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk&rsquo;s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta&rsquo;s Threads and its algorithms",

      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",
      "Even as its challenges aren\u2019t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a \u201ccrossroads,\u201d said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team.",
      "\u201cWhether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,\u201d Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.",
      "That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.",
      "Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.",
      "\u201cBluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,\u201d Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're \u201ctrying to keep everybody happy\u201d are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't \u2014 see Meta's platforms \u2014 the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.",

    "summary": "Two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over TikTok's future, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to delay a Jan. 19 deadline.",
    "story": [
      "The high court is set to hear arguments Jan. 10.",
      "Two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over TikTok's future, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to delay a Jan. 19 deadline for the app to be sold to a new owner or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "An amicus brief filed by Trump's nominee to be solicitor general, John Sauer, is asking the court to grant a stay delaying the deadline so that the incoming president can work out a \"negotiated resolution\" that would save the app.",
      "The filing casts Trump as someone who \"alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government.\"",
      "Trump's brief says he \"opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture,\" but does not express the view that the law requiring the sale violates the First Amendment, saying he takes no position on the merits of the case.",
      "Instead, the filing from Sauer asks the court to put the deadline on pause to allow Trump's incoming administration \"to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "TikTok, which has over 170 million U.S. users, has sued over the law requiring it to be sold by its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance by Jan. 19 or be banned in the U.S.",
      "A federal appeals court earlier this month rejected the company's request for an emergency pause in the deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in the case on Jan. 10.",
      "President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was part of a massive, $95 billion foreign aid package passed by Congress, on April 24.",
      "Biden and some congressional leaders argued that the ultimatum against TikTok was necessary because of security concerns about ByteDance and its connections to the Chinese government.",
      "Trump originally tried to ban TikTok in his first term, but has since reversed course, vowing during the 2024 presidential campaign to \"save\" the app.",
      "In Trump\u2019s amicus brief, Sauer raised the idea of social media censorship, invoking Brazil\u2019s recent month-long ban of social media platform X, the treatment of the Hunter Biden laptop story and government efforts to stamp out COVID-19 misinformation as incidents that should give the justices pause.",
      "\u201cThis Court should be deeply concerned about setting a precedent that could create a slippery slope toward global government censorship of social media speech,\u201d Sauer wrote in the filing. \u201cThe power of a Western government to ban an entire social-media platform with more than 100 million users, at the very least, should be considered and exercised with the most extreme care\u2014not reviewed on a \u2018highly expedited basis.\u2019\u201d",
      "While Sauer acknowledged that TikTok may pose national security risks while it remains under ByteDance\u2019s control, he also urges the justices to be skeptical of national security officials, whom, he said, \u201chave repeatedly procured social-media censorship of disfavored content and viewpoints through a combination of pressure, coercion, and deception.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a jarring parallel between the D.C. Circuit\u2019s near-plenary deference to national security officials calling for social-media censorship, and the recent, well-documented history of federal officials\u2019 extensive involvement in social-media censorship efforts directed at the speech of tens of millions Americans,\u201d Sauer wrote.",

      "\"The investigation into the air accident is ongoing. And we do not think we have a right to give any assessments and will not do so until conclusions are drawn based on the results of the investigation,\" Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Friday. \"We have our own aviation authorities that can do it, and this information may come only from them.\"",

      "Tennessee has a porous safety net for mothers and young children, recent research and an analysis by The Associated Press found. It\u2019s unknown how many women in the state have given birth because they didn\u2019t have access to abortion, but it is clear that from the time a Tennessee woman gets pregnant, she faces greater obstacles to a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a financially stable family than the average American mom.",
      "Like other states with strict abortion bans, Tennesseans of childbearing age are more likely to live in maternal care deserts and face overall doctor shortages. Women, infants and children are less likely to be enrolled in a government nutrition program known as WIC. And Tennessee is one of only 10 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid to a greater share of low-income families.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s survival, every day,\u201d said Janie Busbee, founder of Mother to Mother, a Nashville-based nonprofit providing baby supplies for low-income moms. \u201cIf we took some of that stress off of them, then maybe they\u2019d have time to dream.\u201d",
      "GOP state leaders in Tennessee and other states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 argue that they are bolstering services for families.",
      "Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which allowed an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "The state also raised the Medicaid income limit for parents to the poverty level \u2014 nearly $26,000 for a family of three \u2014 and offers recipients 100 free diapers a month for babies under two. According to the governor's office, these changes have resulted in thousands of new parents accessing government services.",
      "\u201cPro-life is much more than defending the lives of the unborn,\u201d Republican Gov. Bill Lee said in his 2023 annual address to lawmakers and echoed more recently on social media. \u201cThis is not a matter of politics. This is about human dignity.\u201d",
      "Yet, nonprofit leaders and mothers told the AP there are still significant gaps in the safety net.",
      "Anika Chillis, a 39-year-old single mom in Memphis, has Medicaid, WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps). While she\u2019s deeply grateful for the help, she said it also can disappear \u2014 like when she temporarily lost WIC.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said, sitting on a park bench as her 2-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter played nearby. \u201cGroceries are constantly going up.\u201d And being a single mom \u201cmakes it doubly hard on you.\u201d",
      "Tennessee fared poorly at WIC enrollment, Medicaid, having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, an October study found.",
      "Other states with similarly restrictive abortion laws \u2014 such as Idaho, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia and Mississippi \u2014 ranked poorly on numerous measures, too. Researchers said restrictive states had a slightly higher average birth rate and a much lower average abortion rate than the least restrictive states.",
      "\u201cIn general, these states that restrict abortion are the more fiscally conservative, the more socially conservative states,\u201d said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Public Health.",
      "The Republican supermajority in the Tennessee legislature has long rebuffed efforts to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $35,600 for a family of three. And TennCare faces criticism already, with a federal judge ruling earlier this year that the state unlawfully terminated coverage for thousands of families and had a \u201clethargic\u201d response to nearly 250,000 children losing coverage because of paperwork problems caused by the state.",
      "DiJuana Davis, 44, was among the plaintiffs. In 2019, the Nashville resident was supposed to have surgery to prevent pregnancy and ease her chronic anemia. Days before the procedure, she was informed her Medicaid coverage had been cut off and the hospital was canceling.",
      "She later found out her renewal paperwork went to the wrong address, an error that left her uninsured for two months \u2014 during which she became pregnant and developed preeclampsia. Doctors induced labor to save her life, and her son was born prematurely.",
      "\u201cThe system is broken,\u201d she said, \u201cand it needs to be fixed.\u201d",
      "More than 3% of the 83,000 babies born in Tennessee in 2023 had mothers who didn\u2019t receive prenatal care. Only seven states had a higher share, according to an AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "After birth, doctor shortages impede ongoing care. Around a third of Tennesseans live in a primary care shortage area \u2014 a greater share than in all but 10 other states \u2014 according to an AP analysis of data from the Census Bureau and the Health Resources and Services Administration.",
      "Moms described several aid programs as frustrating to navigate. Chillis was on WIC for several months after her son was born, but then went without because of mistake during the renewal process \u2014 eventually getting it restored with help from the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center.",
      "Chillis credits a nonprofit preschool provider with linking her to aid programs in the first place: \u201cI don't see a lot of advertisements about, you know, how you can join this program or go get this\u201d service, she said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t have the knowledge.\u201d",
      "Cagnacci, who is pregnant and has a 1-year-old, said she was on SNAP for a while but missed an appointment and was unclear about the steps after that. The process to get recertified was \"such a headache\u201d that she's going without it.",
      "\u201cI just felt like it was purposely being made difficult so that I would just give up,\u201d she said.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to get social services there, according to a survey by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it\u2019s difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\u201cPeople who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\u201d said Madden, the researcher. But the weakness of the safety net shows \u201cthe hypocrisy of that argument.\u201d",
      "Tennessee\u2019s new diaper program shows the deep political divisions surrounding aid programs. The Republican governor described it as an effort to strengthen families while Democratic state Sen. London Lamar said GOP leaders are \u201ctrying to put a little bow on an abortion ban.\" And GOP state Sen. Mark Pody recently told the right-leaning news website Tennessee Conservative that \u201cit is not the state\u2019s responsibility to have a diaper for every single baby\" and floated the possibility of cutting the program.",
      "Of Tennessee's 2.8 million households, 30% earn above the poverty level but not enough to afford the basic cost of living in their counties, according to a recent report. Often, they don't qualify for government help.",
      "\u201cSome are working three jobs and still can\u2019t survive,\u201d said Busbee, of Mother to Mother.",
      "A fragmented patchwork of charities can help, but they don\u2019t cover the entire state. The Nashville Diaper Connection, for example, serves 30 counties, working with partners to provide 50 diapers a month, mostly to working families who make a bit too much for Medicaid. Other nonprofits are hindered in helping by government agencies' income rules. And most charities are constrained by the ebb and flow of donations.",
      "Nonprofit leaders fear their job may get harder with a new administration in Washington and a GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans could seek significant changes to federal assistance programs they\u2019ve long criticized, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through four years of a Trump administration, and the goal under the Trump administration was to cut social services,\u201d said Signe Anderson, the justice center's senior director of nutrition advocacy. \u201cI\u2019m concerned \u2026 for families in Tennessee and across the country.\u201d",

      "Williamson is calling for a reinvention of the Democrat party.",
      "Marianne Williamson, spiritual leader and author who ran two longshot Democratic presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, framing her run as a way to reimagine the Democratic Party as the party regroups and takes stock of its losses during the 2024 election cycle.",
      "In an announcement video posted early Thursday morning, Williamson framed her candidacy for party chair as a chance to rethink the party as a whole.",
      "\"I feel that in order for the Democrats to rise like a phoenix on the ashes of our electoral defeat, we need to look at more than just the outer issues, such as data analysis and field organizing and fundraising,\" Williamson said. \"We need to transform -- in a way, we need to reinvent the Democratic Party in order to counter what MAGA is bringing to the table.\"",
      "In an accompanying blog post, Williamson stressed Democrats must better understand President-elect Donald Trump's appeal and strategy to better counter it, adding that she wants to \"reinvent the party from the inside out.\"",
      "\"President Trump has ushered in an age of political theater -- a collective adrenaline rush that has enabled him to not only move masses of people into his camp, but also masses of people away from ours. It does not serve us to underestimate the historic nature of what he has achieved,\" Williamson wrote. \"In fact, it's important that we recognize the psychological and emotional dimensions of Trump's appeal. We need to understand it to create the energy to counter it.\"",
      "\"As Chairwoman, I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out. For if we want a new President in four years, and a new Congress in two, then we must immediately get about the task of creating a new party,\" she added later.",
      "Williamson also said that she would have a \"a 365-days-of-the-year strategy\" to allow Americans to be politically involved yearround and that she wants the party to inspire Americans.",
      "Williamson was unable to generate a groundswell of support in either of her bids for president, although she stayed in the race until the Democratic presidential primaries concluded and she gained some traction with Democrats who wanted to protest the White House on the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Williamson was also hypercritical of the DNC, in part, for not holding presidential primary debates against President Joe Biden Biden last cycle and has accused it of rigging the process against her.",
      "\"We have a very frayed bond of affection with millions of Americans particularly working people in the United States. We have to address the problem on that level. On the level of the heart. On the level of the mind,\" Williamson told ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips on Thursday afternoon. \"People aren't feeling it about Democrats anymore. At least not enough of them to make for the kind of victory we need in '26 and '28.\"",
      "Williamson needs to get the support of at least 40 DNC members to qualify for the first DNC candidate forum in early January. The DNC plans on hosting four moderated forums before the election.",
      "She joins a handful of other declared candidates for DNC chair, including Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Jamie Harrison, the current chairman, isn't running for reelection.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions.",
      "Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision on Monday to change the sentences of 37 of the 40 condemned people to life in prison without parole, arguing that it was senseless and insulted the families of their victims. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cWhen you hear the acts of each, you won\u2019t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d",
      "Presidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty \u201cas soon as I am inaugurated,\u201d but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of \u201cviolent rapists, murderers, and monsters.\u201d",
      "He highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty \u2014 including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cTrump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,\u201d said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cBut whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.\u201d",
      "Berman said Trump\u2019s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden\u2019s commutation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, \u2018don\u2019t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Most Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.",
      "Before Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.",
      "\u201cThe reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,\u201d Berman said.",
      "A question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.",
      "Berman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.",
      "\u201cThat would literally take decades to unfold. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Berman said.",
      "Before one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.",
      "One of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.",
      "The other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.",
      "Some families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates.

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Following the release of the report, Gaetz shared on X what appears to be a message he received from President-elect Donald Trump, though it is unclear when the message was sent.",
      "\"I got a great note from President Trump!\" Gaetz wrote alongside a photograph showing what appears to be a brief message from Trump, saying, \"Matt very unfair!\"",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "Last month, Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",
      "\"After Plaintiff's resignation from Congress, Defendants improperly continued to act on its investigation, and apparently voted to publicly release reports and/or investigative materials related to Plaintiff without proper notice or disclosure to Plaintiff,\" the complaint said.",
      "Following the report's release Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta gave Gaetz until 5 p.m. ET to show why the suit shouldn't be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, given \"this case appears to be moot in light of the House Ethics Committee's public disclosure of the report.\"",
      "In a subsequent filing, attorneys for Gaetz acknowledged that their lawsuit is now \"mooted\" following the release of the report -- a move they said has caused Gaetz \"irreversible and irreparable harm.\"",
      "The filing said the committee's decision to release the report was \"unprecedented and procedurally defective,\" and reiterated their claim that it was released without notifying him.",

    "summary": "\u201cIf you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democratic senator told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
    "story": [
      "Fetterman said his colleagues should \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said he hopes President-elect Donald Trump is successful in his second term and that he's not \"rooting against him.\"",
      "\"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\" Fetterman told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"So country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"",
      "Fetterman, who has made headlines as one of the few in his party who have met with several of Trump's cabinet picks, said his Democratic colleagues need to \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- A 93-year-old former Catholic priest sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for raping a teenage boy has died, Louisiana authorities and his lawyer confirmed Friday.",
      "Less than two weeks after being sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars, Lawrence Hecker died of natural causes at 3 a.m. Thursday at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, according to Ken Pastorick, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections communications director.",

      "The Associated Press does not identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted.",

      "Hecker had been ordained as an archdiocesan priest in 1958 and remained in this position even after facing an undisputed complaint of child molestation in the late 1980s, according to court records. Hecker left the ministry in 2002.",

      "Bibb County sheriff's deputies said Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, died at a hospital. Another man was critically injured, while five others are expected to recover.",
      "In a news conference Thursday, Sheriff David Davis said an argument broke out among people gathered at the house and that one person \u201ctook a gun out and started just seemingly indiscriminately shooting.\u201d",
      "Davis said investigators are seeking to question someone in the shooting but didn't name a suspect. He said there are many witnesses, but that some were hospitalized, others didn't want to talk because they were doing something illegal, and others were drunk. Davis said investigators have a blurry photograph of a dark vehicle but are seeking more pictures or video to help identify it.",

He said multiple arrests were made at the house where the shooting happened and another house in November 2023. He said deputies succeeded in shutting down the site of Thursday's shooting for much of this year, and there had only been four police calls to the location this year, with bootlegging activity shifting to another house on the street.

      "A Rhode Island man has admitted to using gasoline to set several fires around the exterior of a predominantly Black church earlier this year",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A Rhode Island man has admitted to using gasoline to set several fires around the exterior of a predominantly Black church earlier this year, according to a federal plea agreement.",
      "Prosecutors said Kevin Colantonio set several fires around the exterior of the Shiloh Gospel Temple early Feb. 11 in North Providence after purchasing a lighter and gasoline.",
      "The building was vacant at the time and the fires were quickly extinguished by members of the North Providence Police and Fire departments, investigators said. The fires caused property damage.",
      "A lawyer representing Colantonio didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Without the quick action of first responders who arrived at the church at about 12:12 a.m. following reports of an individual trying to set fires, the damage to the house of worship would have been catastrophic, investigators said at the time.",
      "Zachary Cunha, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island, said at the time of Colantonio\u2019s arrest that a search of his home turned up notebooks and writings that included phrases like \u201cburn churches down to the ground,\u201d \u201chunt them down,\u201d and \u201cgun everyone down who isn\u2019t white.\u201d",
      "The plea agreement, which was filed in federal court last week, states that Colantonio intentionally targeted the church because of the \u201cactual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, and/or ethnicity of the congregants.\u201d",
      "Most of the Pentecostal congregation, which has been established for about 35 years, is Black and African American, according to investigators.",
      "No injuries were reported.",
      "Colantonio faces four counts: obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs; malicious damage by means of fire; and two counts of assault on a federal officer.",
      "If served consecutively, Colantonio faces 56 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years, a fine of $1 million and three years of supervised release.",
      "A change of plea hearing is scheduled for Jan. 7."

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden has imposed sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgia\u2019s ruling political party",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia\u2019s ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and towards Russia, U.S. officials said Friday.",
      "The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties \u201cfor undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,\" according to a statement.",
      "The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the U.S. has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. Those sanctions include freezes on assets and properties those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families.",
      "\u201cWe strongly condemn Georgian Dream\u2019s actions under Ivanishvili\u2019s leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. \u201cThe United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.\"",
      "Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia\u2019s prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, Georgia\u2019s longtime ruling party.",
      "Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia\u2019s membership application process indefinitely.",
      "In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country\u2019s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- After a nearly weeklong search, Athena found her way home to her Florida family in time for Christmas Eve and even rang the doorbell.",
      "Athena, a 4-year-old German Shepherd and Husky mix, escaped her home in Green Cove Springs, Florida, on Dec. 15, prompting a search among the community and nearby towns for her. Her owner, Brooke Comer, said her family left for church that day and got a message from her neighbor with a picture of Athena outside the house.",
      "Comer panicked. Her family rushed home to find her collar in the crate and no visible opening Athena could have gotten out from. How she escaped remains a mystery.",
      "The next week's events continued to be an \u201cunbelievable\u201d story for Comer, where neighbors and community members from nearby towns would contact her from her missing dog ads and send any footage or photos where they may have spotted Athena. Based on all the alerts Comer got, it looked like Athena made a nearly 20-mile (32-kilometer) roundtrip while she was missing.",
      "At every alert, Comer and her family would go to the spot within minutes and search for Athena \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\u201cShe was the hide-and-seek all time grand champion,\u201d Comer said. \u201cWith every sighting my heart jumped, and it honestly was excitement and then your heart's crushed because we were always one step behind.\u201d",
      "The entire search was a terrifying and scary experience for Comer, who was worried about where her already skittish dog could have gone or could have encountered. That was until 2:30 a.m. Christmas Eve, when she got a Ring video notification from her doorbell and her other dog began barking.",
      "\u201cI was kind of like in a daze, and the dog was barking, and as soon as I heard that ring, I looked at my phone and you could see in the video it was Athena and she was jumping at the door, ringing the doorbell,\u201d Comer said.",
      "As soon as Comer opened the door, Athena bolted inside and went to go lick her son's face, who was on the couch half-asleep. After that, she immediately grabbed her ball to play and shortly went to her cage to go back to sleep.",
      "Comer said the experience gave so much hope because of the neighbors and the large community looking for Athena for the past week. The next plan was to get Athena a full exam, flea and tick treatments and a microchip."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 12:05:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal officials say the United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials say the United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country",
      "The United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness this year, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said federally required tallies taken across the country in January found that more than 770,000 people were counted as homeless \u2014 a number that misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own.",
      "That increase comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\u201cNo American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe, and quality housing they deserve,\u201d HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \u201cevidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\u201d",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\u201cIncreased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\u201d Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \u201cAs advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\u201d",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don\u2019t violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\u201cThe reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\u201d Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \u201cWith bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country\u2019s housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\u201d",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023. California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",
      "The numbers ticked up to about 580,000 in the 2020 count and held relatively steady over the next two years as Congress responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency rental assistance, stimulus payments, aid to states and local governments and a temporary eviction moratorium.",

      "As the calendar changes to 2025, you might be thinking about how to approach your relationship with money in the new year",
      "NEW YORK -- With the end of 2024 around the corner, you might be reflecting on financial goals for 2025.",
      "Whether you're saving to move out of your parents' house or pay off student loan debt, financial resolutions can help you stay motivated, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for Credit Karma.",
      "\u201cEntering a new year doesn\u2019t erase all our financial challenges from the prior year,\" Alev said. \u201cBut it can really help to bring a fresh-start mentality to how you\u2019re managing your finances.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re planning to make financial resolutions for the new year, experts recommend that you start by evaluating the state of your finances in 2024. Then, set specific goals and make sure they're attainable for your lifestyle.",
      "Here are some tips from experts:",
      "Think about how you currently deal with finances \u2014 what's good, what's bad, and what can improve.",
      "\u201cLet this be the year you change your relationship with money,\u201d said Ashley Lapato, personal finance educator for YNAB, a budgeting app.",
      "If you feel like money is a chore, that there's shame surrounding the topic of money, or like you were born being \u201cbad at money,\u201d it's time to change that mentality, Lapato said.",
      "To adjust your approach, Lapato recommends viewing money goals as an opportunity to imagine your desired lifestyle in the future. She recommends asking questions like, \u201cWhat do my 30s look like? What do my 40s look like?\u201d and using money as a means to get there.",
      "Liz Young Thomas, head of SoFi Investment Strategy, added that it\u2019s key you forgive yourself for past mistakes in order to move into the new year with motivation.",
      "When setting your financial resolutions for 2025, it's important to establish the \u201cwhy\u201d of each, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial tracking app.",
      "\u201cIf you can attach the financial goal to a bigger life goal, it\u2019s much more motivating and more likely you\u2019ll continue on that path,\u201d Watson said.",
      "Whether you're saving to buy a house, pay off credit card debt or take a summer vacation, being clear about the goal can keep you motivated. Watson also recommends using a tool to help you keep track of your finances, such as an app, spreadsheet, or website.",
      "\u201cAfter three years of inflation, your pay increases are likely still playing catch up to your monthly expenses, leaving you wondering where all the money is going,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \"Make that monthly budget for 2025 and resolve to track your spending against it throughout the year.\"",
      "McBride said that you may need to make adjustments during the year as certain expenses increase, which would require cutting back in other areas.",
      "\u201cCalibrate your spending with your income, and any month you spend less than budgeted, transfer the difference into your savings account, ideally a high-yield savings account,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInterest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down very fast, so you\u2019re still going to have to put in the hard work of paying down debt, especially high-cost credit card debt, and do so with urgency,\u201d McBride said.",
      "Start by taking stock of how much debt you have now relative to the beginning of the year. Hopefully you\u2019ve made steady progress on paying it down, but, if you\u2019ve gone in the other direction, McBride encourages making a game plan. That includes looking into 0% balance transfer offers.",
      "\u201cYou have more power over credit card interest rates than you think you do,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cWielding that power is one of the best moves you can make in 2025.\u201d",
      "A 0% balance transfer credit card is \u201ca good weapon\u201d in the fight against high card APRs, or annual percentage rates, he said. A low-interest personal loan is an option as well.",
      "You may simply be able to pick up the phone and ask for a lower interest rate. LendingTree found that a majority of people who did that in 2024 were successful, and the average reduction was more than 6 points.",
      "When planning for your financial resolutions, it\u2019s important to consider how you\u2019re going to make your goals sustainable for your lifestyle, said Credit Karma's Alev.",
      "\u201cIt really is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d Alev said.",
      "Alev recommends setting realistic, practical goals to make it easier to stick with them. For example, instead of planning to save thousands of dollars by the end of the year, start by saving $20 a paycheck.",
      "Even when your plans are achievable, there are times you'll get derailed. Maybe it\u2019s an unexpected medical bill or an extraordinary life event. When these situations happen, Alev recommends trying not to feel defeated and working to get back on track without feeling guilty.",
      "\u201cYou can't manage what you can't see, so set a New Year\u2019s resolution to check your credit score monthly in 2025,\" said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore. \u201cBe sure to pay more than the minimum on your credit accounts, as that's one of the best ways to boost your credit score.\u201d",
      "Bandebo also advises student loan borrowers to make all payments on time, as servicers will begin to report late payments starting in January, and missed payments will affect borrowers' credit scores.",
      "Automated changes, like increasing workplace 401(k) plan contributions, setting up direct deposits from paychecks into dedicated savings accounts, and arranging for monthly transfers into an IRA and/or 529 college savings accounts all add up quickly, McBride said.",
      "Your financial goals can encompass more than just managing your money better \u2014 they can also be about keeping your money safe from scams. A golden rule to protect yourself from scams is to \u201cslow down,\u201d said Johan Gerber, vice president of security solutions at Mastercard.",
      "\u201cYou have to slow down and talk to other people if you\u2019re not sure (whether or not) it\u2019s scam,\u201d said Gerber, who recommends building an accountability system with family to keep yourself and your loved ones secure.",
      "Scammers use urgency to make people fall for their tricks, so taking your time to make any financial decision can keep you from losing money.",
      "Your financial goals don\u2019t always have to be rooted in a dollar amount \u2014 they can also be about well-being. Finances are deeply connected with our mental health, and, to take care of our money, we also need to take care of ourselves.",
      "\u201cI think that now more than any other year, your financial wellness should be a resolution,\" said Alejandra Rojas, personal finance expert and founder of The Money Mindset Hub, a mentoring platform for women entrepreneurs. \"Your mental health with money should be a resolution.\u201d",
      "To focus on your financial wellness, you can set one or two goals focusing on your relationship with money. For example, you could find ways to address and resolve financial trauma, or you could set a goal to talk more openly with loved ones about money, Rojas said.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has ruled that the Georgia state Senate can subpoena Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis",
      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ruled that the Georgia state Senate can subpoena Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as part of a inquiry into whether she has engaged in misconduct during her prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump but is giving Willis the chance to contest whether lawmakers' demands are overly broad.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram filed the order Monday, telling Willis she has until Jan. 13 to submit arguments over whether the subpoenas seek legally shielded or confidential information. Ingram wrote that the would issue a final order later saying what Willis had to respond to.",
      "A state appeals court earlier this month removed Willis from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others, citing an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d that might not typically warrant such a removal. The Georgia Court of Appeals panel said in a 2-1 ruling that because of the romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade \u201cthis is the rare case in which disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.\u201d",
      "Willis\u2019 office immediately filed a notice of intent to ask the Georgia Supreme Court to review the decision.",
      "The Republican-led Senate committee sent subpoenas to Willis in August seeking to compel her to testify during its September meeting and to produce scores of documents. The committee was formed earlier this year to examine allegations of \u201cvarious forms of misconduct\u201d by Willis, an elected Democrat, during her prosecution of Trump and others over their efforts to overturn the former president\u2019s 2020 election loss in Georgia.",
      "The resolution creating the committee focused in particular on Willis\u2019 hiring of Wade to lead the prosecution against Trump and others. The resolution said the relationship amounted to a \u201cclear conflict of interest and a fraud upon the taxpayers\u201d of the county and state.",
      "Willis' attorney, former Democratic Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, argued that the Senate committee did not have the power to subpoena her. He also argued that the subpoenas were overly broad and not related to a legitimate legislative need, saying the committee is seeking confidential and privileged information, as well as private and personal information.",
      "Willis\u2019 challenge was pending in mid-September when she skipped a hearing during which the committee members had hoped to question her.",
      "In October, the committee asked Ingram to require Willis to comply with the subpoenas. The committee\u2019s lawyers wrote in a court filing that Willis\u2019 failure to do so had delayed its ability to finish its inquiry and to provide recommendations for any legislation or changes in appropriations that might result.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willis\u2019 actions showed a \u201ctremendous lapse in judgment,\u201d but he did not find a conflict of interest that would disqualify Willis. He said she could continue her prosecution as long as Wade stepped aside, which he did.",
      "Willis and Wade have acknowledged the relationship but have said it began after he was hired and ended before the indictment against Trump was filed.",
      "One wrinkle in the proceedings is that the current Georgia legislative term will end when lawmakers are sworn in for their new term on Jan. 13. However, Republican state Sen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming said last week that he will file legislation to reestablish the committee at the beginning of the 2025 legislative session.",
      "\u201cDespite our committee\u2019s lawful subpoena, DA Willis has refused to testify,\u201d Dolezal said in a statement. \u201cThis, coupled with troubling revelations of apparent violations of Georgia\u2019s open records laws, paints a disturbing picture of an office operating as though it is above the law. This behavior undermines public trust and raises serious questions about the integrity of her office.\u201d",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones said he would support Dolezal's move, saying Willis' \u201crefusal to come before the committee is unacceptable and addressing these issues to require accountability will be a priority for the Senate.\u201d"

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- States with restrictive abortion laws generally have more porous safety nets for mothers and young children, according to recent research and an analysis by The Associated Press.",
      "Tennessee is an example of how this plays out. Tennessee residents of childbearing age are more likely to live in maternal care deserts and face overall doctor shortages. Women, infants and children are less likely to be enrolled in a government nutrition program known as WIC. And Tennessee is one of only 10 states that hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid to a greater share of low-income families.",
      "The AP reported on how safety net programs in Tennessee and states with similarly strict abortion laws often fail families. Here are some key takeaways.",
      "The Republican supermajority in the Tennessee legislature has long rebuffed efforts to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $35,600 for a family of three.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal judge ruled TennCare \u2014 the state's Medicaid program \u2014 unlawfully terminated coverage for thousands of families and had a \u201clethargic\u201d response to nearly 250,000 children losing coverage because of paperwork problems.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee argues that his administration has enhanced services. For example, it boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to one year, which allowed an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "The state also raised the Medicaid income limit for parents to the poverty level \u2014 nearly $26,000 for a family of three \u2014 and began offering recipients 100 free diapers a month for babies under two.",
      "\u201cPro-life is much more than defending the lives of the unborn,\u201d Lee said in his 2023 annual address to lawmakers and echoed more recently on social media. \u201cThis is not a matter of politics. This is about human dignity.\u201d",

The process to get recertified was \u201csuch a headache\u201d that she\u2019s going without SNAP.",
      "\u201cI just felt like it was purposely being made difficult so that I would just give up,\u201d she said.",
      "The issues extend beyond Tennessee. Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to get social services there, according to a survey by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it\u2019s difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "Of Tennessee\u2019s 2.8 million households, 30% earn above the poverty level but not enough to afford the basic cost of living in their counties, according to a recent report. Often, they don\u2019t qualify for government help.",

      "DiJuana Davis, 44, was among the plaintiffs. In 2019, the Nashville resident was supposed to have surgery to prevent pregnancy and ease her chronic anemia. Days before the procedure, she was informed her Medicaid coverage had been cut off and the hospital was canceling.",

      "Tennessee\u2019s new diaper program shows the deep political divisions surrounding aid programs. The Republican governor described it as an effort to strengthen families while Democratic state Sen.

Mark Pody recently told the right-leaning news website Tennessee Conservative that \u201cit is not the state\u2019s responsibility to have a diaper for every single baby\" and floated the possibility of cutting the program.",

      "Most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials share responsibility for the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO \u2014 although not as much as the person who pulled the trigger",
      "WASHINGTON -- Most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials share responsibility for the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO \u2014 although not as much as the person who pulled the trigger, according to a new poll.",
      "In the survey from NORC at the University of Chicago, about 8 in 10 U.S. adults said the person who committed the killing has \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of responsibility for the Dec. 4 shooting of Brian Thompson.",
      "Despite that, some have cast Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspect charged with Thompson\u2019s murder, as a heroic figure in the aftermath of his arrest, which gave rise to an outpouring of grievances about insurance companies. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition investigators found at the scene, echoing a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "UnitedHealthcare has said Mangione was not a client.",
      "About 7 in 10 adults say that denials for health care coverage by insurance companies, or the profits made by health insurance companies, also bear at least \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of responsibility for Thompson\u2019s death. Younger Americans are particularly likely to see the murder as the result of a confluence of forces rather than just one person's action.",
      "The poll finds hat the story of the slaying is being followed widely. About 7 in 10 said they had heard or read \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d about Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "Multiple factors were seen as responsible. About half in the poll believe that at least \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of blame is rooted in wealth or income inequality, although they did not think other factors like political divisions in the U.S. held the same level of responsibility.",
      "Patients and doctors often complain about coverage denials and other complications interfering with care, especially for serious illnesses like cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Insurance industry critics frequently point to company profits in questioning whether the interests of patients are their top focus.",
      "UnitedHealthcare made more than $16 billion in profit last year, before interest and taxes, on $281 billion in revenue. Insurers frequently note that most of the revenue they bring in goes back out the door to pay for care. UnitedHealthcare said this month that it pays about 90% of medical claims when they are submitted. The insurer has not provided details about how many claims that involves.",
      "Americans under 30 are especially likely to think a mix of factors is to blame for Thompson\u2019s death. They say that insurance company denials and profits are about as responsible as Thompson\u2019s killer for his death. About 7 in 10 U.S. adults between 18 and 29 say \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of responsibility falls on profits made by health insurance companies, denials for health care coverage by health insurance companies or the person who committed the killing.",
      "Young people are also the least likely age group to say \u201ca great deal\u201d of responsibility falls on the person who committed the killing. Only about 4 in 10 say that, compared with about 6 in 10 between 30 and 59. Roughly 8 in 10 adults over 60 say that person deserves \u201ca great deal\u201d of responsibility.",
      "About two-thirds of young people place at least a moderate level of blame on wealth or income inequality, in general.",
      "People under 30 are more likely to place blame on the media, with 54% saying that compared with about one-third of older adults.",
      "Frustrations with health insurers, coverage and the complicated U.S. health care system have been simmering for years among patients.",
      "About 3 in 10 Americans say they have had a problem getting coverage from their health insurer in the last year, whether those involved problems finding a suitable provider in-network, a claim getting denied or issues getting prior authorization or insurer approval before care happens. These struggles are more prevalent among Americans under 60.",
      "Insurers say prior authorizations help eliminate waste in the system and let people know whether care will be covered before it is delivered.",
      "Roughly 3 in 10 in the poll say immediate family or close friends have experienced problems getting coverage from their health insurer in the last year. Americans under 30 are among the most likely to say they don\u2019t have health insurance.",
      "Most Americans get health coverage through their job or by purchasing individual policies. Separate, government-funded programs provide coverage for people with low incomes or those who are age 65 and over or have severe illnesses or disabilities.",
      "\u2014-",
      "The poll of\u202f1,001 adults was conducted Dec. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

      "The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said \u201cincludes multiple negative sections on China.\u201d",
      "China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense.",
      "The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that \u201crelevant senior executives\u201d of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any.",
      "Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved.",
      "The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries.",
      "Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the \u201cso-called\u201d threat from China to justify increased military spending.",
      "\u201cU.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,\u201d he said at a press conference. \"This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.\u201d",
      "The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.",
      "Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Malcolm Koonce was born, his father spent time in prison for an armed robbery conviction that prosecutors now say was tainted by a detective\u2019s lies and \u201chighly suggestive\u201d photo identification techniques.",
      "Jeffrey Koonce, now 67, will ask a suburban New York judge on Friday to vacate his conviction for a 1981 robbery at Vernon Stars Rod and Gun Club in Mount Vernon, where three people were struck by shotgun pellets as patrons were looted of cash and jewelry.",
      "Koonce, who spent nearly eight years in prison, has always maintained his innocence. Westchester County District Attorney Mimi Rocah is backing his request after her office uncovered trouble with the case.",
      "Rocah\u2019s Conviction Review Unit investigated the 1983 conviction and found evidence that Mount Vernon police pressured the lone victim-witness to implicate Koonce, made Koonce\u2019s picture larger than others in a photo array and failed to interview alibi witnesses who corroborated his claim that he was elsewhere.",
      "A Mount Vernon detective later lied about the composition of the photo arrays when he testified at pretrial hearings and Koonce\u2019s trial, and a court subsequently ordered the department to change its unduly suggestive photo identification practices, Rocah said. One of the detectives involved in Koonce\u2019s case later went to prison following a federal corruption sting.",
      "In a statement, Rocah said Koonce\u2019s conviction \u201cwas tainted by such questionable investigatory processes and procedures\u201d that her office can no longer stand by it.",
      "Koonce and his lawyer, Karen Newirth, are set to appear Friday before Westchester County Judge James McCarty to request that he vacate Koonce\u2019s robbery and weapons possession convictions and dismiss the underlying indictment.",
      "Koonce absconded from court during jury deliberations and was found about seven months later, sleeping on his girlfriend\u2019s couch in the Bronx, according to newspaper reports from the time.",
      "He was sentenced to 7\u00bd to 15 years in prison for the robbery and served a shorter, simultaneous sentence for bail jumping. He was released on parole in August 1992. His brother, Paul, a high school sophomore at the time, also was charged in the robbery. He was acquitted.",
      "Malcolm Koonce was born in 1998. The NFL's Raiders drafted him in 2021. Another son, Dejuan Koonce, is a retired New York State Trooper who was assigned to protective details for Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "Police accused Jeffrey and Paul Koonce of being among the three men who held up the Vernon Stars club on June 20, 1981. Patrons were forced to lie face down on the floor and made to hand over about $500 in cash, jewelry and other valuables, police said.",
      "One of the perpetrators had a sawed-off shotgun and fired off at least two rounds, striking a 15-year-old and two other patrons, police said.",
      "Rocah\u2019s office found that detectives used dubious tactics to compel a victim to identify Koonce as the shooter. He was the only person to do so. Others told investigators that it was too dark in the club to identify the perpetrators by their faces.",
      "The witness, a high school freshman at the time, picked Koonce out of a photo array that featured Koonce\u2019s enlarged photo and smaller images of men who didn\u2019t look like him.",
      "The witness later told Rocah\u2019s office that he didn\u2019t remember seeing any faces in the dark club and that other patrons immediately covered him after the shooting, obscuring his view.",
      "Detectives then brought Koonce to the hospital where the witness was being treated so he could identify him in person. The witness told a pretrial hearing that he felt pressured to quickly identify Koonce. The trial judge called the tactic \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d",
      "Rocah\u2019s office also found Mount Vernon detectives harmed Koonce by failing to interview all his alibi witnesses. They include a now-retired New York City police detective who said Koonce was with him in the city the night of the robbery.",

      "Here's a look at some of the most notable state laws taking effect:",
      "California, home to Hollywood and some of the largest technology companies, is seeking to rein in the artificial intelligence industry and put some parameters around social media stars. New laws seek to prevent the use of digital replicas of Hollywood actors and performers without permission and allow the estates of dead performers to sue over unauthorized AI use.",

Starting with the new year, penalties will kick in: a $150 fine for the first violation, progressing to $500 for third and subsequent offenses and up to 15 years imprisonment if a driver using a cellphone cause an injury or death.

    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",

      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",

      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",

We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",

      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",

    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",

Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",
      "Manmohan Singh defended his record, saying his government had worked with \"utmost commitment and dedication for the country and the welfare of its people\".",
      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters."

      "The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts.",

    "story": [
      "Pascual Andreu points proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914.",
      "But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.",
      "\"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\"",
      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",
      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",
      "Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.",
      "\"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.",
      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",
      "\"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over \u20ac1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.",
      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "Only 40.1% of fourth year pupils - typically aged 14-16 years old - achieved a pass rate for National 5 mathematics in 2024, while 75.2% passed English. Just over 25% passed the most popular science subject, biology.",
      "The Scottish government said that not all pupils sit National 5 exams in S4.",
      "The Commission on School Reform is an independent group of education experts, set up by think tank Reform Scotland.",
      "Its latest report analyses SQA exam data based on the number of pupils in the cohort, rather than the number which sit the examination.",

      "Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Ford said issues like staffing could be a contributing factor to the reason for the decline in student performance, but Scotland does not collect enough data to examine the true cause.",

      "\"Pupils are choosing subjects on the basis of where they are most likely to succeed and that's even more concerning because we have to ask ourselves, why do fewer pupils now expect to succeed in maths and in stem subjects?",
      "\"For society as whole, this is not good news. Society develops on the back of an educated population and not having the level of education in sciences and mathematics that other countries do will be to Scotland's disadvantage.\"",
      "'Not good enough'",
      "Chair of Reform Scotland and former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell said it was \"very worrying\" that less than half of Scotland's 16-year-olds had passed National 5 maths.",
      "He added:  \"If our economic future is to be based around industries like renewable energy and health sciences, improving our pass rates in mathematics and the sciences is a matter of critical national importance.",

      "Some students may not obtain a National 5 qualification in maths in S4 but go on to get one in S5.",
      "Another factor is worth considering too.",
      "Once English and maths, or at least arithmetic, were effectively compulsory for students in S4.",
      "Now they are often just options, albeit relatively popular ones.",
      "This reflects how many schools only allow students to do a maximum of six National 4 or 5 courses in S4.",
      "There are several issues worthy of discussion.",
      "One is whether young people at all schools should have the chance to obtain more than 6 qualifications in S4.",
      "Another is whether certain subjects should, in effect, be mandatory as was once the case. (Until the 1980s any student with a reasonable prospect of passing was expected to do O Grade English and Maths. From the late 80s on, most would study Standard Grade courses in these subjects at the appropriate level.)",
      "If, however, compulsion is not the answer some supporters of particular subjects may want to consider if more can be done to make them attractive options which a greater number of students might positively choose."

    "story": [
      "Grange Hill and Hollyoaks creator Sir Phil Redmond has said that modern broadcasting lacks courage, and suggested that TV watchdog rules should be broken more often.",
      "The man behind the iconic soaps said gritty programming was important, and that there was a vacuum of such for today's youth.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Phil suggested social media was a major issue that needed frank exploring through television dramas.",
      "\"I think the problem is, is that the courage has gone out of broadcasting really, and there's just too much risk aversion,\" Sir Phil told the show's guest editor Sir Sajid Javid on Friday.",
      "Sir Phil was joined on the programme by Chairman of Ofcom Lord Michael Grade and Grange Hill star Michelle Gayle, who respectively added mental health and misogyny to the list of topics needing realistic reflecting on television.",
      "\"There is a place for something like Grange Hill, and from my career, I always found that the harder you made the storyline, the more you upset the regulators, but the more the audience appreciated it,\" Sir Phil said.",
      "Audiences live the kinds of issues explored by such programmes, he added, \"and what they want to see is their own life put on screen as realistically as possible\".",
      "Lord Grade agreed with Sir Phil, and said there was \"absolutely, no harm at all\" in upsetting Ofcom.",
      "\"This was an amazing, amazing show. It changed television in more ways than I think people realise,\" he said.",
      "Prior to Grange Hill, Lord Grade likened youth television to \"the world of Enid Blyton\", featuring gentle storylines.",
      "\"Then along came Grange Hill, the anxieties as you go through growing up, there it was in the raw,\" he said.",
      "Grange Hill was a series that aired on the BBC from 1978 to 2008 and storied life in a London comprehensive school.",
      "It was known for its gritty social realism, exploring racism as well as drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness and HIV and Aids.",
      "Ms Gayle, who played student Fiona Wilson, said she was never labelled a \"diversity hire\", and that her character \"just existed\" naturally within the show.",
      "\"There was no, kind of, 'this is woke casting',\" she said.",
      "\"This was a multicultural school because this is what most schools were experiencing at the time.",
      "\"It was 'never you're the black person,' or 'you're the token,' it's 'lets show what's happening right now',\" she said.",
      "Asked what issues the guests would think Grange Hill would explore if on air today, Lord Grade suggested mental health and family relationships.",
      "\"These are big stories today, and very emotionally engaging,\" he said.",
      "Choosing rising prevalence of misogyny, Ms Gayle said: \"I think there's a real conversation to be had around TV getting a grip, getting young boys to watch so they are outside this toxic echo chamber [of social media].\"",
      "Sir Phil said social media itself would be the issue to tackle.",
      "\"There's no counterpoint to that, and that's what Grange Hill used to offer,\" he said.",
      "\"It didn't matter what the issue was... Grange Hill would always offer some solution or some way to go and ask somebody about this issue, but at the end of it, it's basically, you're not on your own.\""

      "\"Call the Midwife will always be a drama for me about women and the working classes,\" she tells the BBC.",

      "There have only been two instances where she's been asked to change something in the show, which was initially set in 1957 and is about to hit the 1970s.",
      "\"One was for the haemorrhage machine,\" she recalls, describing a contraption which recreates post-birth blood loss.",
      "\"I think it's a unique piece of equipment to us.",
      "\"We were told the blood was too noisy on the lino [on the floor] - so that was literally about a sound effect.\"",

      "\"I never know which organ is coming under pressure.",
      "\"But there's this kind of 'Wow' moment, when I see things that actually happened, and then that feeds into the fictional process of developing the drama.\"",
      "The show is also a family affair for Thomas, given her husband Stephen McGann plays a central character, GP Dr Patrick Turner.",
      "His recognisable face is often the reason the couple are approached in the street by fans, who don't always realise who Thomas is.",
      "\"He's always quick to say: \"'Oh, this is the lady who writes it',\" she says, \"and then they kind of go into a meltdown! I think some people don't realise we're married in real life.\"",
      "The series is broadcast in up to 200 global territories, although its biggest audience is in the US.",
      "She laughs as she recalls seeing the dubbed version of McGann on Italian TV while the couple were away on holiday there.",
      "\"They gave him a really deep, sexy laugh, out of all proportion to what he was saying - it was a lovely 'har har har'.\"",
      "Thomas, whose other writing work includes 2007 BBC period drama Cranford and 2017 mini-series Little Women, says despite how much of her life is entwined with the show, she still manages to keep home and work separate.",
      "She rarely goes on set during filming, and explains that McGann never sees the scripts before they're issued to the other actors.",

      "Now 32, Davies is appearing in cinemas around the world in Better Man, a musical biopic in which he plays his childhood hero.",
      "But he is far from recognisable, partly because of his hard work studying and recreating William's voice and mannerisms, but mostly because he's represented on screen as a computer-generated chimpanzee.",
      "\"I am the lead. I am Rob. Rob is me. Just with a monkey layering on top,\" he explains.",

      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 19:34:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress' explosive legal case claims to lift the lid on tactics used to destroy stars' reputations.",
    "story": [
      "Actress Blake Lively was arguably the internet's public enemy number one for a couple of weeks in the summer. She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",
      "\"You know we can bury anyone,\" Nathan wrote to Abel in one damning discussion.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Actor Baldoni women's solidarity award rescinded amid allegations",
      "Now, the people hired to do crisis PR for Baldoni are doing crisis PR for themselves.",
      "Abel has said Lively's lawyers \"cherry picked\" messages to include in their case without crucial context, and that there was \"no 'smear' implemented\".",
      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",
      "In recent days, Lively has received support from a string of former co-stars and others in Hollywood.",
      "The name of one of her supporters stands out.",
      "Amber Heard, former wife of Johnny Depp, told NBC: \"Social media is the absolute personification of the classic saying, 'A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.'",
      "\"I saw this firsthand and up close. It's as horrifying as it is destructive.\"",
      "Heard was on the receiving end of social media hostility during two high-profile libel trials involving Depp in the UK and US in 2020 and 2022. Nathan also reportedly worked for Depp.",
      "Freedman responded to Heard by saying the only connection between her and Lively was that \"for decades every move they have made has been out there for everyone to see\" so the public could \"make up their own minds - which they did, organically\".",
      "Tortoise Media head of investigations Alexi Mostrous, who hosted a podcast called Who Trolled Amber? earlier this year examining the abuse she received, said there were parallels.",
      "\"In both the Blake Lively case and the Amber Heard case, you see PR companies working with digital media specialists and other 'contractors' to promote online stories beneficial to their wealthy clients in ways that are opaque and not well understood,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It's an unregulated world where all sorts of tactics can take place behind closed doors.\"",
      "'Common tactic'",
      "Variety said Lively's case \"lays bare a show business process that's meant to operate in the shadows \u2013 the hiring of expensive crisis communications experts to sway opinion and uplift clients\".",
      "Her allegations suggest a \"sinister shadow campaign\" that went \"beyond what most publicity firms in Hollywood see as acceptable\", The Wrap's Sharon Waxman wrote.",
      "According to Rory Lynch, partner and head of reputation management law at Gateley Legal, it is \"quite a common tactic\" in Hollywood and business disputes to \"have PRs on both sides planting negative stories, sometimes false stories, about the opposition\".",
      "\"Even back in the golden era of Hollywood, there were rumours that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were using PR professionals to negatively brief against each other.\"",
      "However, the PR people who worked for Baldoni and his studio \"dropped the ball a little bit\" by discussing tactics in texts, he told BBC News.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me, especially in the US and Hollywood, that you've got quite aggressive crisis PR people.",
      "\"But the fact that they put that in writing, I think, was possibly not the wisest thing. Normally they might do something like that over the phone.\"",
      "Lively herself is \"a sophisticated operator\" who will \"have her own PR people working away in the background as well\", Lynch added.",
      "'Our eyes are open'",
      "The New York Times, which broke the story of Lively's complaint at the weekend, said she \"denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer\".",
      "The paper also pointed out that \"it is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity\" towards Lively was originally seeded by those working on behalf of Baldoni, \"and how much they noticed and amplified\".",
      "Some fans have stressed that their criticisms were genuine, but many who turned against Lively now see the situation in a different light.",
      "\"We are so able to be manipulated into hating a woman that all it takes is a co-ordinated PR effort for us to switch sides against a domestic abuse victim, or a long-beloved American sweetheart,\" wrote Maddy Mussen in the Standard.",
      "\"Now our eyes are open, will we be harder to fool? Or will we still want any excuse to turn on a famous woman who is suddenly, in our eyes and the eyes of the ones manipulating us, no longer worthy?\"",
      "The Guardian's Laura Snapes wrote that she and her friends had now \"looked back, horrified, on what we had said about her in recent months\".",
      "She added: \"Lively's complaint has left my head spinning. What can you really trust?\""

      "Kapranos and wife Clara Luciani welcomed their first child last year, and the 52-year-old told BBC Scotland News departing on tours with his band is now \"really difficult.\"",
      "\"Saying goodbye to him is hard,\" says the singer, speaking as his band prepare to release their sixth album, The Human Fear, in January.",
      "\"I've spent my adult life shirking responsibility, and being as irresponsible as possible, so being presented with responsibility is quite refreshing.",
      "\"A lot of people said to me that sleep deprivation would destroy me, but it was just like 2004 when the band was kicking off and I never went to bed.",
      "\"We'd be playing gigs, going out all night and then be up at 6am to fly somewhere. I slept about two hours a night back then, so this is the same - just without a hangover.\"",
      "Kapranos will be forced to say goodbye on a few occasions as 2025 goes on, with a busy year in store for Franz \u2013 now revamped and reformatted since those early days, but still adept at writing artful indie pop.",
      "Emerging from Glasgow's bustling music scene Kapranos, guitarist Nick McCarthy, bassist Bob Hardy and drummer Paul Thomson enjoyed chart success with inescapable singles like Take Me Out, earned a reputation as one of the country's finest live acts and snagged the Mercury Music Prize in 2004.",
      "That victory came as the band thought \"anyone but us would win,\" recalls the singer.",
      "\"It's quite a Glasgow attitude. You're like 'we're not the sort of people who win prizes'.\"",
      "Success had taken time to arrive.",
      "Kapranos was born in England but moved to to Scotland as a child. As a teenager he became entrenched in the 90s Glasgow music scene, running club nights and playing in the likes of cult indie band the Yummy Fur before forming Franz Ferdinand.",
      "Much has changed since their debut album won the Mercury, with The Human Fear marking the group's first studio offering since the exit of original drummer Thomson in 2021.",
      "Guitarist McCarthy had left in 2016.",

      "\"Whenever we do a cover it always sounds like us, and I like that.  We did Good Luck Babe [by Chappell Roan] on Radio 2, which is an amazing song but when we play it, it just sounds like Franz Ferdinand.",
      "\"Bob and I were talking about this before we made this record, that it's good to be at ease with your identity and your sound.",

      "A greatest hits compilation in 2021 and ensuing tour helped the singer make \"peace with everything that we've done before\".",
      "\"I'm not the kinda person who likes to look back,\" he adds.",
      "\"Once we make a record I never really listen to it again, so for the tour I was being forced to listen to that music again, and I found I felt pretty comfortable with it.\"",
      "Celebrating the past meant the band were also eager to try new things for the future.",

      "However, while the title might suggest a record bubbling with dread, Kapranos says it's about the opposite.",
      "\"The greatest moments in life are when you overcome fear,\" he says, admitting his own childhood terror was the shark in Jaws.",
      "\"Watching horror films or riding rollercoasters gives you a buzz and we should maybe approach some wider existential fears with the same attitude.",

      "'Loathe' to write about politics again",
      "Politics is something Franz Ferdinand have visited before. In 2014 they backed Scottish independence and two years later they released Demagogue, aimed at the then incoming American President Donald Trump.",
      "However the second Presidency of Trump is unlikely to spur such a similiar reaction.",
      "\"Trump's not my favourite man and there's so much in worldwide politics that's disheartening,\" says the singer.",

      "\"Some of my friends on social media just bang on about it all the time. The arts is a powerful tool of protest and we should continue to do that, but there's a difference between that and low key whinging.\"",

      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice.\"",
      "They added: \"Most upsetting is the unabashed exploitation of domestic violence survivors' stories to silence a woman who asked for safety. The hypocrisy is astounding.",

      "However, prosecutors claim he was involved in commercial transactions of up to 60kg.",

      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",

      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",

      "In 2000, Gail was shocked to receive the news that Sarah (Tina O'Brien) was pregnant at the age of 13.",

      "3. Her husband, the serial killer",

      "Gail, with a now legendary line, branded Richard as \"Norman Bates with a briefcase\", a reference to the serial killer in classic Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.",

      "\"You're just so used to seeing her, that twinkly-eyed little lady who's just a ball of joy, she's going to be hugely missed.",
      "\"I mean, that character - she's such an icon. She's one of the last greats.\"",
      "Eileen was not the only Weatherfield woman to be on the receiving end of Gail's anger when defending her family.",
      "In 2010, the tempestous but loyal Gail had an aggresive food fight with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) after Deirdre was found to have kissed the partner of Gail's mum, Audrey.",
      "\"Ken, do something!\" exclaimed a cake-splattered Deidre.",
      "5. Falsely imprisoned for murder",
      "In 2010, Gail got married again, this time to Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale).",
      "This one wasn't any happier in the end, though, as he decided he was going to fake his own death due to debts.",
      "But he accidentally drowned for real on a boat trip, leading to his new wife being arrested for murder after witnesses said they'd seen the couple arguing (about his aforementioned plan).",
      "In prison, troublemaker Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) lied that her cellmate Gail had confessed to killing Joe.",
      "Luckily for one of the street's most downtrodden characters, Gail was found not guilty and released.",
      "6. Helping her son deal with his wife's death",
      "Gail had her troubles with son David (Jack P. Shepherd) as well, once accusing him of delibrately causing \"fear and misery to everyone in this family\".",
      "\"We've had sleepless nights,\" she added dramatically. \"I'm on pills, for God's sake!\"",
      "By 2016, David was a married man himself. However, that came to a tragic end when his wife Kylie (Paula Lane) was stabbed to death, dying in David's arms.",
      "Gail's motherly advice was for him to be honest with his own children about what had happened.",
      "In a heart-rending, tear-filled scene, she recalled the day she had struggled to tell her eldest son Nick (nowadays Ben Price) the truth about his dad Brian being killed, explaining that the boy had been left scarred.",
      "\"It was just about the worst conversation of my life,\" Gail told David, with a wry laugh to break the tension. \"And it's had some competition.\"",
      "Price told the BBC that while his on-screen mum's big storylines \"were great\", he would miss the \"beautiful bits in between\" with her the most.",
      "\"For me, it's being welcomed into the Platts' [house] in the morning, or having a cup of tea, or going, 'Don't worry mum'.",

      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",
      "\"And yet [she was saying], if you did know everybody's business then you would have seen this coming.\"",
      "The powerful scene was nominated for Bafta's Must See Moment award.",
      "Speaking before Worth's final scenes, Coronation Street's executive producer Iain MacLeod confirmed she wouldn't die. \"It didn't feel like killing her off would be right,\" he told the Daily Star.",
      "\"Gail has had a hard life. She had a difficult childhood and disastrous marriages. So, we thought what viewers really want is a happy ending for her, so that's what we're doing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 22:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Over the centuries, painters in India have depicted Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
    "story": [
      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy.",
      "\"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.",
      "Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities.",
      "In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).",
      "Biblical scenes unfold in local settings and feature motifs and elements that speak to an Indian audience.",
      "Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity.",
      "\"Fonseca wanted to situate Christianity - which has largely been viewed as a western religious tradition - within the Indian subcontinent. It was from this angst that his watercolours painted Christianity anew,\" Rinald D'Souza, director of the Xavier Centre of Historical Research, Goa, told the BBC."

      "From the moment Justin Baldoni announced in 2019 that he was adapting the best-selling book It Ends With Us into a film, there was a widespread frenzy.",
      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",
      "The podcast bills itself as creating \"a safe environment\" for exploring issues such as how \"masculinity\" shows up in relationships, as well as \"sex, success\" and \"mental health\".",

    "summary": "After dominating culture this summer, Brat tops a \"poll of polls\" to be named the year's best record.",
    "story": [
      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",
      "Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.",
      "Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter.",
      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",

At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",

      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",

      "An ECG (electrocardiogram) records and can reveal problems with the electrical activity of the heart, including the rate and rhythm.",

      "\"It's not as simple as saying it's this or that bit of the ECG. It's looking at a combination of subtle things.\"",
      "As part of the trial up to 1,000 patients at both hospitals will have ECG scans read by the AI system to see if it helps detect and predict disease.",

    "summary": "The party leader defends not outlining specific policy positions so far in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
    "story": [
      "Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted she will not be rushed into policy positions, claiming there is no \"quick fix\" following the party's defeat in July's general election.",
      "Badenoch became the party's sixth leader in less than nine years when she was elected at the start of November.",
      "In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said the public \"kicked out\" the Conservatives because the party was not trusted and did not deliver, adding building trust is \"something that takes a while\".",
      "Badenoch also dismissed concerns that her approach of not pinning down policy positions could leave a vacuum that might be filled by Reform UK.",
      "Speaking to Amol Rajan, Badenoch said: \"Reform is saying stuff because it hasn't thought it all through. You can give easy answers if you haven't thought it all through.",
      "\"I do the thinking and what people are going to get with new leadership under me is thoughtful Conservatism, not knee-jerk analysis.\"",
      "\"We are about what we are for, not just what we are against,\" she said earlier in the interview.",
      "Badenoch said she would not \"rush out\" policy positions within six weeks and people would need to be \"patient\", but that she wanted to ensure people could believe she was telling the truth so she could earn their trust.",
      "In response, Reform leader Nigel Farage said the Conservative leader \"doesn't understand that the level of betrayal means that the Tory brand is broken. She personally bears heavy responsibility for this\".",
      "During the leadership contest, Badenoch deliberately avoided specific policy positions, focusing instead on Conservative \"principles\".",
      "But some in the party - including Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen - have warned against leaving a void on key issues such as migration that could be filled by Reform.",
      "Houchen told the BBC this month there was a \"big opportunity\" for the Tories because Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had \"left the field\" on the issue of migration, and called for the party to put forward a \"sensible narrative\".",
      "'Let people down'",
      "In the interview, Badenoch acknowledged again that her party had \"let people down\" in the area of migration.",
      "She said the numbers were too high, having previously pledged to put a cap on arrivals into the UK \u2013 though she has not specified what level she would consider acceptable.",
      "Net migration hit a record in the year to June 2023 - with the difference between those arriving in the UK and leaving standing at 906,000 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The net figure dropped to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",
      "The previous Conservative government's key migration policy was the Rwanda deportation scheme designed specifically to deter small boat crossings.",
      "No flights were able to take off to the east African country before July's election after numerous legal challenges, and Labour swiftly scrapped the scheme after winning power.",
      "The new government has focused on tackling the criminal gangs involved in people smuggling, with Sir Keir announcing an extra \u00a375m to go to policing UK borders in November.",
      "At a press conference last month, Badenoch said the Conservatives still believed a \"deterrent\" was necessary but did not commit to a revival of the Rwanda scheme.",
      "In the Today interview, Badenoch also acknowledged the local elections scheduled for May next year would be difficult for her party, but said it was a marathon not a sprint.",
      "She said: \"The Conservative Party is under changed leadership and I think that the voters will start to see that, but it's going to be slow and steady. It's the tortoise strategy, not the hare.\"",
      "A Labour spokesperson said: \"Every time Kemi Badenoch speaks it becomes clearer that she has no solutions to the problems the Tories created.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the Conservatives have made unfunded spending commitments worth billions without explaining how she would pay for any of them.\"",
      "Musk 'challenge'",
      "Farage told the BBC last week that Reform was in \"open negotiations\" with US billionaire Elon Musk about donations to the party.",
      "Mr Musk will hold a role within the US government from January with President-elect Donald Trump appointing him as lead for the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Asked whether she was concerned about the prospect of Mr Musk donating to Reform, Badenoch downplayed the possibility it would happen but said she \"believes in competition\".",
      "She said: \"So I think that if Elon Musk is giving a party, a competitor party money, then that is a challenge for me to make sure that I raise the same.\"",
      "She said it might be \"counterproductive\" for Reform, claiming people in the UK \"don't necessarily like to see politics being bought\".",

      "Many charities and other non-profit groups provide supported housing without issue, but the housing select committee found issues arose when private firms began entering the sector over the last decade to provide \"exempt\" supported accommodation.",

      "Charities and MPs argue these exempt supporting housing firms have exploited a lack of regulation and the benefit loophole to make millions while providing low-quality housing.",
      "In response to these concerns, the new law gives the department for housing and local councils powers to set standards for supported housing providers, but no exact start date has been set for a consultation into how the law will work.",

      "A Nasa spacecraft has made history by surviving the closest-ever approach to the Sun.",
      "Scientists received a signal from the Parker Solar Probe just before midnight EST  on Thursday (05:00 GMT on Friday) after it had been out of communication for several days during its burning-hot fly-by.",
      "Nasa said the probe was \"safe\" and operating normally after it passed just 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface.",

      "Moving at up to 430,000 mph (692,000 kph), the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 1,800F (980C), according to the Nasa website.",
      "\"This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,\" the agency said.",
      "Dr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, previously told BBC News: \"For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go [and] visit it.",
      "\"And so we can't really experience the atmosphere of our star unless we fly through it.\"",
      "Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018, heading to the centre of our solar system.",
      "It had already swept past the Sun 21 times, getting ever nearer, but the Christmas Eve visit was record-breaking.",
      "At its closest approach, the probe was 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from our star's surface.",
      "That might not sound that close, but Dr Fox put it into perspective. \"We are 93 million miles away from the Sun, so if I put the Sun and the Earth one metre apart, Parker Solar Probe is 4cm from the Sun - so that's close.\"",
      "The probe endured temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could have frazzled the on-board electronics.",
      "It was protected by an 11.5cm (4.5in) thick carbon-composite shield, but the spacecraft's tactic was to get in and out fast.",
      "In fact, it moved faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.",
      "Parker's speed came from the immense gravitational pull it felt as it fell towards the Sun.",
      "So why go to all this effort to \"touch\" the Sun?",
      "Scientists hope that as the spacecraft passed through our star's outer atmosphere - its corona - it will have collected data that will solve a long-standing mystery.",
      "\"The corona is really, really hot, and we have no idea why,\" explained Dr Jenifer Millard, an astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in Wales.",
      "\"The surface of the Sun is about 6,000C or so, but the corona, this tenuous outer atmosphere that you can see during solar eclipses, reaches millions of degrees - and that is further away from the Sun. So how is that atmosphere getting hotter?\"",
      "The mission should also help scientists better understand solar wind - the constant stream of charged particles bursting out from the corona.",
      "When these particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field the sky lights up with dazzling auroras.",
      "But this so-called space weather can cause problems too, knocking out power grids, electronics and communication systems.",
      "\"Understanding the Sun, its activity, space weather, the solar wind, is so important to our everyday lives on Earth,\" said Dr Millard.",

      "Dr Fox had been expecting the team to text her a green heart to let her know the probe was OK as soon as a signal was beamed back home.",
      "She previously admitted she was nervous about the audacious attempt, but had faith in the probe.",
      "\"I will worry about the spacecraft. But we really have designed it to withstand all of these brutal, brutal conditions. It's a tough, tough little spacecraft.\""

      "Legislation requiring local authorities to create a \"definitive map\" showing public rights of way in their area was passed in 1949.",
      "But the documents have been kept under continuous review, meaning anyone with appropriate evidence could apply for a path to be added.",
      "There are estimated to be more than 40,000 miles of rights of way in England which are not officially recorded.",
      "The previous Conservative government had also planned to scrap the cut off date for historic paths to be registered but later decided to extend it from 2026 to 2031, saying this would provide more certainty for landowners, councils and users.",
      "But the Local Government Association said financial pressures had left councils with limited resources to process applications, making the 2031 deadline \"a tall order unlikely to be met\".",

      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",

    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",

      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 01:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

      "\"Now the Azerbaijani side is also expecting Russia to take those steps,\" said political commentator Farhad Mammadov.",
      "Kazakh authorities have been treating the injured and working closely with Azerbaijan on the investigation.",
      "Officials say the Brazilian plane manufacturer Embraer has sent two specialists to the crash site, 3km (1.9 miles) from Aktau airport in Kazakhstan, and three members of Brazil's aviation agency will arrive on Saturday.",
      "Reports in Baku suggest both Russia and Kazakhstan have proposed having a committee from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - a regional organisation dominated by Russia - investigate the crash, but Azerbaijan has instead demanded an international inquiry.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines and several other airlines have suspended flights to some Russian cities in response to the crash.",
      "In a social media post, the airline said this was \"for security reasons\". It had already halted flights to Grozny and Makhachkala in neighbouring Dagestan, but has now added the cities of Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara and Mineralnye Vody.",
      "Israel's flagship airline, El Al, has meanwhile suspended all flights to Moscow, citing developments in Russian airspace, and UAE-based budget carrier Flydubai has halted flights to Sochi and Mineralnye Vody."

      "Here's what we know about Flight J2-8243.",
      "Flight takes off",
      "In the early morning on Christmas Day, Flight J2-8243 took off from the airport of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. It was due to land in Grozny, the capital of the Russian region of Chechnya.",
      "On board were 67 passengers, most of whom were Azerbaijani nationals, as well as those from Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "The plane was an Embraer 190, operated by Azerbaijan Airlines.",
      "Approach to Grozny",
      "As the flight approached Grozny, it entered thick fog, surviving passengers say.",

      "It was on the third attempt, survivors say, that they felt a series of explosions hit the plane.",
      "\"The third time, something exploded... some of the aircraft's skin had blown out,\" one told Russian TV.",
      "A flight attendant on the plane, Zulfuqar Asadov, told local media the impact of the strike \"caused panic inside\".",

      "Diversion to Kazakhstan",
      "After the incident over Grozny, the plane diverted some 450km (280 miles) east to Aktau airport in Kazakhstan.",
      "It remains unclear why it was diverted over the Caspian Sea - a far longer journey than several other options.",
      "Russian aviation authorities have claimed the pilots of the plane were \"offered other airports\", but chose Aktau.",

      "Crash-landing",
      "Video from near the scene shows the plane descending rapidly through the air before crashing into the ground and skidding for several hundred metres in a ball of flame.",

      "The pilots of the plane are credited with saving lives by managing to land part of the plane, despite themselves being killed in the crash.",
      "It is believed most of those who survived were seated in its rear.",
      "Was it hit by Russian air defence?",
      "Initial reports from Russian media suggested the aircraft collided with a flock of birds.",
      "However, aviation experts and others in Azerbaijan believe the plane's GPS systems were affected by electronic jamming and it was then damaged by shrapnel from Russian air-defence missile blasts.",
      "On Friday White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the US had \"early indications\" Russia was responsible, but declined to comment further.",

      "\"We have enough capabilities - militarily, economically, and even in popular support - to go through this battle, even if we are on our own,\" he insisted.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 23:53:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The killings have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse.",
    "story": [
      "\"The Chinese people are so miserable,\" read a social media post in the wake of yet another mass killing in the country earlier this year. The same user also warned: \"There will only be more and more copycat attacks.\"",
      "\"This tragedy reflects the darkness within society,\" wrote another.",
      "Such bleak assessments, following a spate of deadly incidents in China during 2024, have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse to \"take revenge on society\".",
      "Attacks like this are still rare given China's huge population, and are not new, says David Schak, associate professor at Griffith University in Australia. But they seem to come in waves, often as copycat attempts at garnering attention.",
      "This year has been especially distressing.",
      "From 2019 to 2023, police recorded three to five cases each year, where perpetrators attacked pedestrians or strangers.",
      "In 2024, that number jumped to 19.",
      "In 2019, three people were killed and 28 injured in such incidents; in 2023, 16 dead and 40 injured and in 2024, 63 people killed and 166 injured. November was especially bloody.",
      "On the 11th of that month, a 62-year-old man ploughed a car into people exercising outside a stadium in the city of Zhuhai, killing at least 35. Police said that the driver had been unhappy with his divorce settlement. He was sentenced to death this week.",
      "Days later, in Changde city, a man drove into a crowd of children and parents outside a primary school, injuring 30 of them. The authorities said he was angry over financial losses and family problems.",
      "That same week, a 21-year-old who couldn't graduate after failing his exams, went on a stabbing rampage on his campus in Wuxi city, killing eight and injuring 17.",
      "In September, a 37-year-old man raced through a Shanghai shopping centre, stabbing people as he went. In June, four American instructors were attacked at a park by a 55-year-old man wielding a knife. And there were two separate attacks on Japanese citizens, including one in which a 10-year-old boy was stabbed to death outside his school.",
      "The perpetrators have largely targeted \"random people\" to show their \"displeasure with society\", Prof Schak says.",
      "In a country with vast surveillance capabilities, where women rarely hesitate to walk alone at night, these killings have sparked understandable unease.",
      "So what has prompted so many mass attacks in China this year?",
      "China's slowing economy",
      "A major source of pressure in China right now is the sluggish economy. It is no secret that the country has been struggling with high youth unemployment, massive debt and a real estate crisis which has consumed the life savings of many families, sometimes with nothing to show for it.",
      "On the outskirts of most major cities there are entire housing estates where construction has stopped because indebted developers cannot afford to complete them. In 2022, the BBC interviewed people camping in the concrete shells of their own unfinished apartments, without running water, electricity and windows because they had nowhere else to stay.",
      "Xi Jinping is worried about the economy - what do Chinese people think?",
      "A Japanese boy was killed in China. Was cyber-nationalism to blame?",
      "\"Optimism certainly does seem to have faded,\" says George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University's China Centre. \"Let's use the word trapped, just for the moment. I think China has become trapped in a sort of cycle of repression. Social repression and economic repression, on the one hand, and a kind of faltering economic development model on the other.\"",
      "Studies appear to point to a significant change in attitudes, with a measurable increase in pessimism among Chinese people about their personal prospects. A significant US-China joint analysis, which for years had recorded them saying that inequality in society could often be attributed to a lack of effort or ability, found in its most recent survey that people were now blaming an \"unfair economic system\".",
      "\"The question is who do people really blame?\" Mr Magnus asks. \"And the next step from that is that the system is unfair to me, and I can't break through. I can't change my circumstances.\"",
      "A lack of options",
      "In countries with a healthy media, if you felt you had been fired from your job unfairly or that your home had been demolished by corrupt builders backed by local officials, you might turn to journalists for your story to be heard. But that is rarely an option in China, where the press is controlled by the Communist Party and unlikely to run stories which reflect badly on any level of the government.",
      "Then there are the courts \u2013 also run by and for the party \u2013 which are slow and inefficient.  Much was made on social media here of the Zhuhai attacker's alleged motive: that he did not achieve what he believed was a fair divorce settlement in court.",
      "Experts say other outlets for venting frustrations have also narrowed or been shut down altogether.",
      "Chinese people often air their grievances online, says Lynette Ong, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, who has carried out significant research on how the Chinese state responds to push back from its people.",
      "\"[They] will go on to the internet and scold the government\u2026 just to vent their anger. Or they may organise a small protest which the police would often allow if it's small-scale,\" she explains. \"But this sort of dissent, small dissent, has been closed off in the last couple of years.\"",
      "There are plenty of examples of this: Increased internet censorship, which blocks words or expressions that are deemed controversial or critical; crackdowns on cheeky Halloween costumes that make fun of officialdom; or when plain-clothed men, who appeared to have been mobilised by local officials, beat up protesters in Henan province outside banks which had frozen their accounts.",
      "As for dealing with people's mental and emotional responses to these stresses, this too has been found wanting. Specialists say that China's counselling services are vastly inadequate, leaving no outlet for those who feel isolated, alone and depressed in modern Chinese society.",
      "\"Counselling can help build up emotional resilience,\" says Professor Silvia Kwok from Hong Kong's City University, adding that China needs to increase its mental health services, especially for at-risk groups who have experienced trauma or those with mental illness.",
      "\"People need to find different strategies or constructive ways to deal with their emotions\u2026 making them less likely to react violently in moments of intense emotional stress.\"",
      "Taken together, these factors suggest the lid is tightening on Chinese society, creating a pressure cooker-like situation.",
      "\"There are not a lot of people going around mass killing. But still the tensions do seem to be building, and it doesn't look like there is any way it is going to ease up in the near future,\" Mr Magnus says.",
      "What should worry the Communist Party is the commentary from the general public blaming those in power for this.",
      "Take this remark for example: \"If the government truly acts fairly and justly, there would not be so much anger and grievance in Chinese society\u2026 the government's efforts have focused on creating a superficial sense of harmony. While it may appear that they care about disadvantaged people, their actions have instead caused the greatest injustices.\"",
      "While violent attacks have been rising in many countries, according to Professor Ong, the difference in China is that officials have had little experience dealing with them.",
      "\"I think the authorities are very alarmed because they've not seen it before, and their instinct is to crack down.\"",
      "When China's leader Xi Jinping spoke about the Zhuhai attack, he seemed to acknowledge pressure was building in society. He urged officials across the country to \"learn hard lessons from the incident, address risks at their roots, resolve conflicts and disputes early and take proactive measures to prevent extreme crime\".",
      "But, so far, the lessons learnt seem to have led to a push for quicker police response times using greater surveillance, rather than considering any changes to the way China is run.",
      "\"China is moving into a new phase, a new phase that we have not seen since the late 70s,\" Prof Ong says, referring to the time when the country began opening to the world again, unleashing enormous change.",
      "\"We need to brace for unexpected events, such as a lot of random attacks and pockets of protest and social instability emerging.\"",
      "When horror hits China, the first instinct is shut it down",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors have formally charged a man in the death of a woman set alight on a New York subway train.",
      "On Friday, Sebastian Zapeta was indicted on charges of murder and arson, though he did not appear during the brief court hearing.",
      "Mr Zapeta, 33, is accused of setting fire to the woman, who may have been asleep on the train, and fanning the flames with a shirt. The victim has not been identified.",
      "The suspect has been held without bail since his arrest shortly after the incident.",
      "The BBC has contacted Mr Zapeta's lawyer for comment.",
      "Police say the woman was sitting on a stationary train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue Station in Brooklyn on Sunday morning when she was approached by a man who used a lighter to ignite her clothing.",
      "There was no interaction between the pair before the attack and police believe they did not know each other.",
      "Officers extinguished the flame, but the woman died at the scene.",
      "The man got off the train as police officers on patrol in the station rushed to the fire, but he did not flee immediately and his face was captured on police body cameras.",
      "At a news conference earlier this week, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch described the incident as \"one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being\".",
      "\"Unbeknownst to the officers who responded, the suspect had stayed on the scene and was seated on a bench on the platform just outside the train car,\" Ms Tisch said.",
      "The suspect then left the scene, and authorities say three high school students later recognised him in images distributed by police.",
      "Mr Zapeta, who is originally from Guatemala, was deported from the US in 2018 and later re-entered the country illegally, immigration authorities said.",
      "In a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said Mr Zapeta told investigators that he had been drinking and did not remember the incident, but did identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has urged federal authorities to also charge Mr Zapeta with arson, in addition to the state charges that he currently faces. In a statement, the mayor said: \"Lighting another human being on fire and watching them burn alive reflects a level of evil that cannot be tolerated.\"",
      "A vigil was held Thursday evening for the victim, who was burned so badly that police have had difficulty identifying her.",
      "False and unverified information about her, including a fake AI-generated picture, has been circulating online. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez told reporters on Friday that authorities are still working to identify the woman using fingerprints and DNA.",
      "Mr Zapeta is due back in court on 7 January, prosecutors said."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 07:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Under the burden of military service, some reservists are refusing to return to Israel's front lines.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s war on multiple fronts has not just worn down its enemy. It's not just taken the lives of thousands of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. It\u2019s also continuing to extract a price from its own people.",
      "There\u2019s a growing sense of war weariness in Israel. The recent ceasefire deal with Lebanon will be a relief for many. Not least for Noam Glukhovsky \u2013 an IDF reservist, who\u2019s spent much of the past year serving on the front line as a medic.",
      "We spoke to Noam, 33, in Tel Aviv before the ceasefire was announced. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this war for much longer. We just don\u2019t have the manpower to keep going on without a clear end date and goal,\u201d he said.",
      "As an IDF reservist Noam would normally expect to do a few weeks of military service a year. But this past year he\u2019s spent 250 days in uniform. The war, he said, had ripped him away from the life he knew. His plans to become a doctor have also been set back by a year.",
      "When we meet Noam was trying to catch up with his studies, but also waiting to see whether he\u2019d be called up again. His mood was defiant.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t put my life on hold anymore,\u201d he said. Unless there was a dramatic change in the direction of the war, he said he wouldn\u2019t be returning to his unit. He\u2019d had enough.",
      "The IDF already acknowledges that fewer reserves are now reporting for duty. After the attacks by Hamas on 7 October last year, which killed about 1,200 people, more than 300,000 reservists responded. Turnout exceeded 100%. Now it\u2019s down to 85%. Noam estimates that in his unit the response is even lower \u2013 with around 60% of those called up now reporting for duty.",
      "Reserves and conscripts are the lifeblood of the IDF. Brigadier General Ariel Heimann \u2013 also a reservist and a former chief reserve officer - says Israel is too small a country to have a large, expensive, professional, regular army. Without reservists, he says, the IDF wouldn\u2019t be able to fight or survive.",
      "According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the IDF has 170,000 active duty personnel, including conscripts, and 465,000 reserves.",
      "Brig Gen Heimann admits the IDF\u2019s reliance on reserves will become more challenging the longer the war goes on. He likened the IDF to a spring \u2013 if it\u2019s stretched too far it\u2019ll break. At the moment he says it\u2019s coping.",
      "But in a sign of the strain the IDF wants to extend mandatory service for male conscripts from 32 to 36 months.",
      "The fact that the burden of service is not being shared by all, has also fuelled a sense of resentment. One group has been exempt from military service for decades \u2013 thousands of Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, Jews. They believe the lives of their young men should be dedicated to religious studies not military service.",
      "The issue has already divided Israel\u2019s coalition government. But, following the intervention of the attorney general, call up papers are being sent to 7,000 Haredi Jewish men. They\u2019ve responded with angry protests. But Brig Gen Heimann, like the ousted former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, says they have a \u201cmoral duty to serve\u201d.",
      "There\u2019s not just a personal sacrifice required, but an economic one too.",
      "The Bank of Israel said in May that the cost of the war for Israel could reach $70bn (\u00a355bn) by the end of next year, an estimate made before the country's ground invasion of Lebanon. Small businesses are among the hardest hit.",
      "Shelly Lotan\u2019s food tech start-up is among many fighting for survival. Shelly\u2019s already had to move her business from northern Israel to avoid Hezbollah\u2019s rockets. Two of her seven employees have been called up for military service.",
      "On the morning we meet, at her Tel Aviv home, Shelly has just received more bad news. She\u2019s received a text from one of her staff whose military service is being extended.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t express how critical it is to have another employee missing for another month,\u201d says Shelly.",
      "\u201cI cannot even hire someone else or solve this gap.\u201d",
      "Shelly\u2019s also had to juggle family life with three young children. Her husband, also a reservist, has had to spend long periods away from home.",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon may ease some of the pressure. But there\u2019s still fighting in Gaza. Shelly Lotan fears for the future without a clear strategy from Israel\u2019s government to end the conflict.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 05:41:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Former Indian PM Manmohan Singh, who died on Thursday, led India through both good and bad times.",
    "story": [
      "People in India are reflecting on former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's contribution to the country since his death on Thursday evening.",
      "Singh, who held the top post for two consecutive terms between 2004 and 2014, was seen as an architect of India's economic liberalisation which changed the country's growth trajectory.",
      "The first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to return to power, Singh was also the first Sikh to assume the top office.",
      "Known as a soft-spoken technocrat, he had earlier headed India's central bank, served as a finance secretary and minister, and led the opposition in the upper house of parliament.",
      "Here are five milestones from Singh's life that shaped his career and had a lasting impact on more than a billion Indians.",
      "Economic liberalisation",
      "Singh was appointed finance minister in 1991 by the Congress party-led government under Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao.",
      "India's economy at the time was facing a serious financial crisis, with the country's foreign reserves at a dangerously low level, barely enough to pay for two weeks of imports.",
      "Singh led the initiative to deregulate the economy to avoid its collapse, which he argued was otherwise imminent. Despite stiff opposition from members of his government and party, Singh prevailed.",
      "He took bold measures that included devaluing the currency, reducing import tariffs and privatising state-owned companies.",
      "He was famously quoted as saying in parliament during his first budget speech in 1991 that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "Later, as prime minister, Singh continued to build on his economic reform measures, lifting millions of Indians out of poverty and contributing to India's rise as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.",
      "Reluctant prime minister",
      "The Congress party made a comeback in 2004 elections, handing a surprise defeat to the government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was widely expected to head the government, but many members of the outgoing ruling party raised questions over the fact that she was born in Italy. She declined to take up the post and instead proposed Singh's name, who was seen as a non-controversial, consensus candidate of great personal integrity.",
      "In the next parliamentary election, he helped his party win a bigger mandate, but critics often termed him a \"remote-controlled\" prime minister managed by the Gandhi family.",
      "Singh often refused to comment on such allegations and kept his focus on the job.",
      "He may have started his first stint as prime minister with some reluctance but he soon stamped his authority on the top job.",
      "Singh's tenure, particularly between 2004 and 2009, saw the country's GDP grow at a healthy average pace of around 8%, the second fastest among major economies.",
      "He took bold decisions on reforms and brought more foreign investment into the country. Experts credit him for shielding India from the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "But his second term, in an alliance with a disparate group of parties, was marked by allegations of corruption against some of his cabinet ministers, though his personal integrity was never questioned.",
      "In response to these allegations, he told journalists in 2014 in his last press conference as prime minister that he hoped history would judge him differently.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he said.",
      "\"I think taking into account the circumstances and the compulsions of a coalition polity, I have done as best as I could do under the circumstances.\"",
      "Rights to education, information and identity",
      "As prime minister, Singh took several far-reaching decisions that continue to impact the health of Indian democracy even today.",
      "He introduced new laws that strengthened and guaranteed the right to seek information from the government, allowing citizens an extraordinary power to hold officials accountable.",
      "He also introduced a rural employment scheme which guaranteed livelihood for a minimum of 100 days, a measure economists said had a profound impact on rural incomes and poverty reduction.",
      "He also brought in a law that guaranteed the right to free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6 and 14, significantly reducing the school dropout rates.",
      "His government also introduced a unique identity project called Aadhar to improve financial inclusion and delivery of welfare benefits to the poor. The current federal government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has continued to keep Aadhar as a cornerstone for many of its policies.",
      "Apology for anti-Sikh riots",
      "In 1984, prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar.",
      "Her death sparked massive violence that resulted in the death of more than 3,000 Sikhs and a widespread destruction of their property.",
      "Singh formally apologised to the nation in 2005 in parliament, saying the violence were \"the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our constitution\".",
      "\"I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. I apologise not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation,\" he said.",
      "No other prime minister, particularly from the Congress party, had gone this far to apologise in parliament for the riots.",
      "Deal with US",
      "Singh signed a historic deal with the US in 2008 to end India's nuclear isolation after its 1998 testing of the weapon system.",
      "His government argued that the deal wouldhelp meet India's growing energy needs and sustain its healthy growth rate.",
      "The deal, seen as a watershed moment in the India-US relations, promised to grant a waiver to India to commence civilian nuclear trade with the US and the rest of the world.",
      "But it faced massive opposition, with critics of the deal alleging that it would compromise India's sovereignty and independence in foreign policy. In protest, the Left Front withdrew support from the governing alliance.",
      "Singh, however, managed to save both his government and the deal."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia.

      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",

We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",

      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",

      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",

      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 23:41:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Waack Girls tells the story of six women who discover themselves as they learn the dance form waacking.",
    "story": [
      "A woman dances in the spotlight, the glittering tassels on her dress shivering and swaying in tandem with her moves.",
      "But it's her arms that catch the light; they wave, spin and whip through the air at breath-taking speed, almost like the blades of a fan.",
      "These are the opening visuals of a recently released web series on Amazon Prime Video called Waack Girls, a drama centred around six women who learn a new dance form to become their city's first all-female waacking crew.",
      "Not many know about the dance and so the women have to fight hard - against society and their families - to be taken seriously. But waacking ends up being the gift that keeps on giving.",
      "Directed by Sooni Taraporevala, the series has been released at a time when many Indian cities - big and small - are witnessing a renewed interest in waacking.",
      "\"I was fascinated by the dance style and the importance it gives to self-expression,\" says Taraporevala about why she made the series.",
      "Workshops and underground waacking jams - events where dancers battle it out with their moves - are mushrooming in several cities and international waacking legends are visiting the country to teach the dance.",
      "Recently, Archie Burnett, who was a club dancer in New York in the 1970s and 80s and is a respected figure in the waacking community, visited India for a jam.",
      "Dancers hope that the web series will give waacking more visibility in the country and show people that there's more to dance than classical forms, hip-hop and Bollywood.",
      "Waacking has a history steeped in the LGBTQ+ liberation movement and the freedom championed by disco music.",
      "The dance style emerged in the gay clubs of Los Angeles in the 1970s, when there was a lot of stigma surrounding homosexuality. Gay men used waacking to express themselves on the dance floor and push back against the hate and discrimination they experienced.",
      "Consequently, the dance style developed swift, sharp and forceful movements - much like how action heroes in comic books beat up their villains, accompanied by sound-effects like \"ka-pow\" and \"bam\".",
      "\"Waacking comes from the onomatopoeic word 'whack' and is reminiscent of [the effects] found in comic books,\" says Tejasvi Patil, a Mumbai-based dancer who has been waacking for more than a decade.",
      "The dance style also drew inspiration from the drama of Hollywood and its glamorous leading ladies. Dramatic poses, quick footwork and striking arm movements are characteristic of waacking but dancers have continued to add new moves to the repertoire of steps, as celebrating individuality and self-expression are at the heart of the form.",
      "And because of its core ethos, waacking continues to be a tool of empowerment and self-expression for India's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"In fact, many people explore their sexual identity through the dance style because it allows space for introspection and expression,\" says Ayushi Amrute, who has been waacking since 2012 and is a frequent host of Red Bull's Your House Is Waack - a waacking jam for dancers across the country.",
      "\"Another important factor is that the waacking community always strives to be a safe space, so that people feel comfortable expressing themselves,\" she adds.",
      "When Amrute was introduced to waacking by her dance teacher, the style was virtually unknown in India. Her teacher encouraged her to watch videos and reach out to dancers abroad to learn more about the style.",
      "\"We [the handful of Indian dancers who began waacking over a decade ago] learnt waacking the hard way; by doing our own research, learning about the history of the dance and connecting with dancers in countries where waacking was popular,\" says Amrute.",
      "Patil remembers learning waacking the same way. But things are remarkably different today. In the past five years or so, the dance style has picked up in popularity, with more youngsters flocking to classes to learn it.",
      "Patil, who teaches dance, says that she encourages her students to stay true to the ethos of the style - unabashed self-expression.",
      "When it comes to music, India is still finding its soundscape for the style, she adds. Songs by disco queen Donna Summer and American pop legend Diana Ross are still popular, as are tracks from the 1983 film Staying Alive.",
      "Bollywood had its own disco era too, with songs like Koi Yahan Nache Nache and Aap Jaisa Koi becoming chart-toppers in the 1980s, but they don't often find space in today's waacking jams.",
      "For Waack Girls, Taraporevala brought in indie artists to create an album of original soundtracks, which Patil says has created a brand new and promising soundscape for waackers in India.",
      "\"I think the time is right for people to embrace who they are fully,\" says Patil, \"and waacking is the perfect platform to showcase what you find.\""

    "summary": "A BBC reporter looks back to the day in 2004 when the tsunami hit while she was on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.",
    "story": [
      "Boxing Day, 2004.",
      "When the earthquake struck at 06:30 (01:00 GMT), I was on a ferry, headed towards Havelock \u2013 an island in the Indian archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar.",
      "Known for its silver sand and clear blue waters, the Radhanagar beach there had recently been crowned \"Asia's Best Beach\" by Time magazine.",
      "My best friend from college and her family had lived in Port Blair, the capital of the archipelago, for a decade and a half, but this was my first visit to the islands, where I had arrived on Christmas Eve.",
      "We had planned to spend three days in Havelock and in the morning we packed snacks and sandwiches, gathered excited children and headed out to catch the ferry from Phoenix Bay jetty in Port Blair.",
      "Not wanting to miss out on anything, I was standing on the front deck, looking around, when disaster struck.",
      "Just as we pulled out from the harbour, the boat lurched and suddenly the jetty next to where we had boarded crumpled and fell into the sea. It was followed by the watchtower and an electricity pole.",
      "It was an extraordinary sight. Dozens of people standing alongside me watched open-mouthed.",
      "Thankfully, the jetty was deserted at the time so there were no casualties. A boat was due to leave from there in half an hour but the travellers were yet to arrive.",
      "A member of the boat's crew told me it was an earthquake. At the time I didn't know, but the 9.1 magnitude quake was the third most powerful ever recorded in the world - and remains the biggest and most destructive in Asia.",
      "Occurring off the coast of northwest Sumatra under the Indian Ocean, it unleashed a devastating tsunami that killed an estimated 228,000 people across more than a dozen countries and caused massive damage in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and Thailand.",
      "The Andaman and Nicobar islands, located just about 100km north of the epicentre, suffered extensive damage when a wall of water, as high as 15 metres (49 ft) in places, hit land just about 15 minutes later.",
      "The official death toll was put at 1,310 \u2013 but with more than 5,600 people missing and presumed dead, it's believed that more than 7,000 islanders perished.",
      "While on the boat, however, we were oblivious to the scale of destruction around us. Our mobile phones didn't work on the water and we only got snippets of information from the crew. We heard about damage in Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives \u2013 and the southern Indian coastal town of Nagapattinam.",
      "But there was no information about Andaman and Nicobar - a collection of hundreds of islands scattered around in the Bay of Bengal, located about 1,500km (915 miles) east of India's mainland.",
      "Only 38 of them were inhabited. They were home to 400,000 people, including six hunter-gatherer groups who had lived isolated from the outside world for thousands of years.",
      "The only way to get to the islands was by ferries but, as we later learnt, an estimated 94% of the jetties in the region were damaged.",
      "That was also the reason why, on 26 December 2004, we never made it to Havelock. The jetty there was damaged and under water, we were told.",
      "Watch Geeta Pandey speak about her experience here",
      "Watch Geeta Pandey speak about her experience here",
      "So the boat turned around and started on its return journey. For a while, there was speculation that we might not get clearance to dock at Port Blair for safety reasons and might have to spend the night at anchor.",
      "This made the passengers  \u2013 most of them tourists looking forward to sun and sand \u2013 anxious.",
      "After several hours of bobbing along in rough seas, we returned to Port Blair. Because Phoenix Bay had been closed following the morning's damage, we were taken to Chatham, another harbour in Port Blair. The jetty where we were dropped had huge, gaping holes in places.",
      "The signs of devastation were all around us as we headed home \u2013 buildings had turned into rubble, small upturned boats sat in the middle of the streets and roads had great gashes in them. Thousands of people had been turned homeless when the tidal wave flooded their homes in low-lying areas.",
      "I met a traumatised nine-year-old girl whose house was filled with water and she told me she had nearly drowned. A woman told me she had lost her entire life's possessions in the blink of an eye.",
      "Over the next three weeks, I reported extensively on the disaster and its effects on the population.",
      "It was the first time a tsunami had wreaked such havoc in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the scale of the tragedy was overwhelming.",
      "Salt water contaminated many sources of fresh water and destroyed large tracts of arable land. Getting vital supplies into the islands was tough with jetties unserviceable.",
      "The authorities mounted a huge relief and rescue effort. The army, navy and air force were deployed, but it took days before they could get to all the islands.",
      "Every day, navy and coast guard ships brought boatloads of people made homeless by the tsunami from other islands to Port Blair where schools and government buildings were turned into temporary shelters.",
      "They brought stories of devastation in their homelands. Many told me they had escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs.",
      "One woman from Car Nicobar told me that when the earthquake struck, the ground started to spew foamy water at the same time as the waves came in from the sea.",
      "She and hundreds of others from her village had waited for rescuers without food or water for 48 hours. She said it was a \"miracle\" that she and her 20-day-old baby had survived.",
      "Port Blair was almost daily jolted by aftershocks, some of them strong enough to start rumours of fresh tsunamis, making scared people run to get to higher ground.",
      "A few days later, the Indian military flew journalists to Car Nicobar, a flat fertile island known for its enchanting beaches and also home to a large Indian air force colony.",
      "The killer tsunami had completely flattened the base. The water rose by 12 metres here and as most people slept, the ground was pulled away from under their feet. A hundred people died here. More than half were air force officers and their families.",
      "We visited Malacca and Kaakan villages on the island which also bore the brunt of nature's fury, forcing residents to take shelter in tents along the road. Among them were families torn apart by the tidal wave.",
      "A grief-stricken young couple told me they had managed to save their five-month-old baby, but their other children, aged seven and 12, were washed away.",
      "Surrounded by coconut palms on all sides, every house had turned into rubble. Among the personal belongings strewn about were clothes, textbooks, a child's shoe and a music keyboard.",
      "The only thing that stood - surprisingly intact - was a bust of the father of the Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi, at a traffic roundabout.",
      "A senior army officer told us his team had recovered seven bodies that day and we watched their mass cremation from a distance.",
      "At the air force base, we watched as rescuers pulled a woman's body from the debris.",
      "An official said that for every body found in Car Nicobar, several had been swept away by the waves without leaving a trace.",
      "After all these years, I still sometimes think about the day I hopped on the ferry to go to Havelock.",
      "I wonder what would have happened if the tremors had come a few minutes earlier.",
      "And what would have happened if the wall of water had hit the shore while I waited on the jetty to board our ferry?",
      "On Boxing Day, 2004, I had a close call. Thousands who perished were not so lucky.",

    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",
      "\"It's obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense that's happening in the world,\" Mr Van Wyk says.",

      "In the vineyards of Bordeaux, the unspeakable has become the drinkable. Wine without alcohol has arrived.",
      "The heresy of yesterday is now \u2013 thanks to science and economic crisis \u2013 the opportunity of today.",
      "Wine estates which would have torched their grapes rather than submit to such ignominy, are now openly contemplating the booze-free bottle.",
      "And developers are moving ahead fast, creating wines that are deliberately designed to get the best from the de-alcoholisation process.",
      "\"When we started a few years ago, what we were making was frankly rubbish,\" says Bordeaux oenologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brochet, who has helped create the Moderato range of no-alcohol wines.",
      "\"But we have made great progress. And today we are getting nearer and nearer to our goal. I think it is going to be a revolution in the wine world.\"",
      "Bordeaux has just seen the launch of its first ever cave \u2013 wine shop \u2013 dedicated solely to no-alcohol wines, reflecting a shift in perceptions which has taken many in the industry by surprise.",

      "\"They don't know anything about how to do it, but they can see it is coming and want to be part of it.\"",
      "Several things have happened to make the moment opportune.",
      "First of all, the French wine world is in deep difficulty. Domestic consumption continues to fall and the Chinese market is not what it was. US President-elect Donald Trump is threatening new levies. Prized ancient vineyards across France are being grubbed up.",
      "Second, consumption habits are shifting, especially among the young. Supermarkets now give more space to beer than they do to wine. Most 20-somethings have never had the habit of wine \u2013 and they are also far more health-conscious than their elders.",
      "The non-alcohol lifestyle is spreading. Currently 10% of the French beer market is alcohol-free. In Spain it is 25%.",
      "And third \u2013 the technology has improved by leaps and bounds.",
      "In the past \u2013 and still today for cheaper brands \u2013 the method has simply been to boil away the alcohol and then add compensatory flavours. The result \u2013 especially for reds \u2013 is at best mediocre. Such drinks cannot even call themselves wine, but \"beverages based on de-alcoholised wine\".",
      "Now though, there are new methods of low-temperature vacuum distillation, and of \"capturing\" aromas for putting back into the de-alcoholised wine. The result is wines that can legally call themselves wines, and are beginning to hold their own among discerning consumers.",
      "\"With reds, you need to be prepared for an experience which will not be the same as a traditional wine with alcohol. We cannot pretend we can replicate, yet, the full mouth-feel,\" says Fabien Marchand-Cassagne of Moderato.",
      "\"But what you will get is a genuine wine moment. Bouquet, tannins, fruits, balance \u2013 it is all there to be enjoyed.\"",
      "At the Clos De Bouard estate near Saint-Emilion, fully a third of sales are now of the chateau's two \u2013 soon to be three \u2013 non-alcoholic brands. Owner Coralie de Bouard first glimpsed the possibilities when she was asked in 2019 to develop a non-alcoholic wine for the Qatari owners of PSG football club.",
      "\"My family wouldn't talk to me for a year, such was my 'treason'. And even today I get hate mail from wine-growers saying I am ruining the market,\" she says.",
      "\"But now my father congratulates me and says I am the locomotive in the wine train. And if we are surviving today in these difficult times, it is because we have shifted towards the no-alcohol market.\"",

      "\"But we have to evolve. The fact is that the customers aren't where they used to be. So we have to go and get them or they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "Promoters of alcohol-free wine make much of the notion that it allows non-drinkers \u2013 who used to feel excluded \u2013 to join in the wine-banter. And it is true that the rituals of opening, sniffing, describing and comparing are now open to all.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carter's attorneys for comment.",
      "Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs.",
      "The lawsuits allege many individuals were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida after receiving drug-laced drinks.",
      "Combs' lawyers have dismissed Buzbee's lawsuits as \"shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\" Jay-Z has said in a statement that Buzbee is trying to blackmail him to settle the Alabama woman's allegations.",
      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",
      "Spiro asked the judge to dismiss the entertainer from the woman's lawsuit and he requested a hearing on the case for the day after he made his requests in writing on Dec. 18.",
      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story. For one thing, the woman said she traveled for five hours from Rochester to watch the music awards show on a jumbotron outside the VMAs even though permits and pictures show there was no jumbotron at the event.",
      "Spiro also noted that the woman's father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick his daughter up in New York City, as she says he did.",

      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",

      "For months, rumors swirled of an onset of discord between the two actors that appears to have culminated with a lawsuit by Lively in which she alleges Baldoni \u2013 who was also the film's director \u2013 caused her \"severe emotional distress.\"",
      "The complaint, which was obtained by CBS News, names Baldoni, the studio behind \"It Ends With Us\" and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the complaint, which was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "The complaint also says Baldoni \"abruptly pivoted away from\" the movie's marketing plan and \"used domestic violence 'survivor content' to protect his public image.\"",
      "\"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\" attorney Bryan Freedman told the AP in a statement. Freedman represents Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.",
      "Freedman pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio \"proactively\" hired a crisis manager \"due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\" He said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film \"if her demands were not met.\" Those demands were not specified in the statement.",
      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" while promoting the film, Baldoni said he hoped the movie would help to create a safer world through compassion and empathy. He said he wanted men to go see the romance movie and take accountability in their lives after watching it.",
      "\"I want men to go to the theater and in some ways see a version of themselves. You have two very different characters. Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",
      "A spokesperson for SAG-AFTRA, the union for TV and movie actors, told CBS News in a statement that Lively's allegations are \"startling and troubling\" and that \"retaliation for reporting misconduct or inappropriate behavior is illegal and wrong.\"",
      "\"We applaud Blake Lively's courage in speaking out on issues of retaliation and harassment and for her request to have an intimacy coordinator for all scenes with nudity or sexual content. This is an important step that helps ensure a safe set,\" the statement said. \"We all have a right to be treated with dignity and respect on the job and to work in an environment free of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.\"",
      "In the statement, the union's spokesperson urged anyone who may be experiencing abusive conduct to report violations on its SAG-AFTRA Safe Place app and to their employer.",

      "As the holiday season lights up New York City, few traditions shine brighter than the iconic holiday windows at Bergdorf Goodman. The luxury department store's displays are more than just decorations \u2014 they are works of art.",
      "And the mastermind behind the art is David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman. He has been with the store for more than 20 years and oversees the design of the windows each year.",
      "He noted that there's no school for making window displays, and that it seems no one in the field sets out to do the job \"on purpose.\"",
      "\"We just kind of happened into it,\" he said. \"And we wouldn't wanna do anything else because we're doing a little of everything. We're doing a little theater, a little storytelling, a little advertising, a little fashion.\"",
      "This year's theme is \"Toast of the Town,\" a nod to the 200th anniversary of Fifth Avenue's retail strip.

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",

      "A new Bob Dylan biopic, \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, arrives in theaters Christmas Day. As historian Douglas Brinkley tells us, it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy love affair between Dylan and the movies.",
      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",

      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",
      "Once Dylan made it to New York's Greenwich Village, it was the art-house international films that caught his eye: Truffaut's \"Shoot the Piano Player\" \u2026 Fellini's \"La dolce vita.\" That film, about a tabloid journalist searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic Rome, looked, Dylan later said, \"like life in a carnival mirror.\"",
      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",
      "His music has enhanced scores of movie scores, from \"The Big Lebowski,\" to more recently \"St. Vincent.\"",
      "One film stuck with Dylan for decades: \"The Gunfighter,\" starring Gregory Peck. When Peck heard his name in Dylan's epic 1986 ballad \"Brownsville Girl,\" he phoned him up to thank him. Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997, when he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "The new biopic \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring an astounding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is hardly the first cinematic depiction of Dylan.

    "title": "The story of Handel's \"Messiah\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

    "summary": "The proposed rule is required under a law passed by Congress last year, and is intended to ensure the safety of makeup and baby powder.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers of baby powder and cosmetic products made with talc will have to test them for asbestos under a proposal announced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "The agency's proposal comes at the directive of Congress, which passed legislation requiring the FDA take action last year.\u00a0 A known human carcinogen, asbestos is found in the same rock types as talc deposits and may mingle in the mining process, potentially leading to contaminated products and raising concerns about the risks to the public.",
      "The FDA's proposed rule would require manufacturers test samples of talc-containing cosmetic products for asbestos with methods including polarized light and transmission electron microscopy, which lights up samples with an electron beam. Alternatively, companies could also rely on a certificate of analysis from their talc suppliers, the agency stated.",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\" Linda Katz, a medical doctor and director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said Thursday in a news\u00a0release announcing the agency's action.",
      "The agency's proposed rule falls short of a ban on talc, which advocates including U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, have\u00a0called for.",
      "Long-running litigation against Johnson & Johnson alleges the company's talc baby powder caused women to develop ovarian cancer. The company in June agreed to pay $700 million to settle allegations it misled people about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",

      "The state hardest hit in the outbreak appeared to be Montana, where 17 were reported sickened, followed by Wisconsin, with 12 cases, and Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming each reporting eight cases. Massachusetts, Texas and Washington accounted for six cases, followed by five in South Dakota and three each in California, Illinois and Iowa. Alaska, Michigan, New Jersey and Utah all called in two cases, and eight states reported one: Arizona, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon that her agency will need to start taking \"extraordinary measures\" or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "But Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign.",
      "He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill. Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Administration is awaiting the possible final enactment of the Social Security Fairness Act into law and rules for implementation. We will provide more information on our website,\u00a0ssa.gov\u00a0as it becomes available,\" a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",
      "Without Senate approval, the bill's fate would have ended with the current session of Congress and would have needed to be re-introduced in the next Congress.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 14:02:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal officials say homelessness rose 18% in 2024, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing.",
    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",

    "story": [
      "This holiday shopping season saw Americans stepping up their purchases at retail stores, with many chains luring shoppers with big Black Friday discounts. But with the holiday now over, retailers are beginning to roll out their post-Christmas sales, aiming to entice shoppers to spend more.",
      "Shoppers spent between $979.5 billion and $989 billion last month and in December, with retail sales up 2.5% to 3.5%\u00a0from a year ago, according to an estimate from the National Retail Federation, the nation's biggest retail trade group.",
      "Retailers are now looking to encourage more of the same in wrapping up the holidays with additional post-Christmas promotions. This year's shorter holiday shopping period placed pressure on some retailers, some of which also struggled to attract inflation-weary consumers through their doors.",
      "\"So far, post-Christmas discounts seem to be slightly bigger than last year,\" GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are working hard to stimulate demand and nudging consumers into spending.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, there is not a dramatic difference. A lot of retailers managed inventory well this year so they don't have loads of stuff left over that they need to shift.\"",

      "Other national retailers are also holding sales, but tying them to the season. Here's a sampling.",
      "Do products usually go on sale after Christmas?",
      "Yes, retailers typically offer post-holiday sales to reduce inventory after Christmas. But this year, American shoppers have another reason to head to the malls or the computer in search of deals: the potential threat of higher prices on many goods if President-elect Donald Trump enacts tariffs on imports.",
      "Sticker-shocked consumers have in recent months seen some relief as inflation abated, but Trump's pledge to impose\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0on imports once back in the White House has some experts warning that prices could increase on a slew of goods in 2025, including made-in-China toys,\u00a0electronics\u00a0and even crude\u00a0oil imported\u00a0from Canada.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:56:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's beneficial ownership information rule, or BOI?",
      "The reporting rule is the CTA's Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirement, or BOI, which mandates small businesses to register the following with FinCEN, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

      "The penalties are up to $591 per day for failure to file, according to FinCEN.",
      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",
      "There are 23 types of businesses that are exempt from the beneficial ownership information filing, according to the Chamber of Commerce. These include many publicly traded companies and nonprofits, as well as some large operating companies.",
      "Many types of banks and other financial services businesses don't need to file, according to FinCEN. Some other types of businesses, such as many sole proprietorships, are also exempt, it noted. (A list and Q&A on exemptions can be seen here.)",
      "What may happen next in the CTA case?",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",

      "Defense lawyers for Jeffries said in court papers unsealed Monday in federal court in Central Islip on Long Island that a neuropsychologist who examined Jeffries in October concluded he likely has dementia with behavioral disturbance, Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.",
      "Jeffries, 80, is free on $10 million bond after pleading not guilty in October to federal sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges. The former CEO was arrested\u00a0that same month on charges of sex trafficking and engaging in interstate prostitution, with prosecutors claiming Jeffries leveraged his position as CEO to lure young men into sex by suggesting they could model for the fashion company,",
      "The lawyers wrote that the neuropsychologist concluded that cognitive impairments, including impaired memory, diminished attention, processing speed slowness, and ease of confusion means Jeffries would not be capable of assisting his attorneys.",
      "In a joint letter to the judge, defense lawyers and prosecutors suggested that experts who have evaluated Jeffries testify at a two-day competency hearing in June so that a ruling on competency can follow. A spokesperson for prosecutors said Tuesday that the office would have no further comment.",
      "Jeffries arrest came after a 2023 lawsuit filed by an actor that alleged the former CEO ran a sex trafficking operation that targeted aspiring male models. In the current case, prosecutors say Jeffries, his romantic partner and a third man lured men into drug-fueled sex parties in the Hamptons, on Long Island, by dangling the promise of modeling for the retailer's ads.",
      "Jeffries left Abercrombie in 2014 after more than two decades leading the clothing retailer once famous for its preppy, all-American aesthetic and marketing with shirtless male models.",
      "In an indictment unveiled in October, prosecutors alleged that 15 accusers were induced by \"force, fraud and coercion\" to engage in sex parties from 2008 to 2015 in New York City and the Hamptons, the wealthy summertime resort on Long Island where Jeffries has a home, as well as at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.",

    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "More than one million delivery drivers collectively paid more than $10 million in fees after Walmart and Branch Messenger illegally opened costly deposit accounts in their names without consent, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleges in a lawsuit filed Monday against the retailer and payments platform.",
      "The federal agency claims drivers were forced to use the accounts to get paid and were deceived about how to access their earnings, with Walmart threatening to fire workers who did not comply. Drivers had to follow a complicated process to get their pay, and then faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money into another account.",
      "As a result, workers forked over more than $10 million in fees to transfer their earnings into accounts of their choosing, the CFPB claims.",
      "\"Walmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a news release. \"Companies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\"",
      "Both Walmart and Branch vowed a vigorous defense.",
      "\"The CFPB's rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law. The CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation,\" the retailing giant said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Branch echoed Walmart's stance, accusing the CFPB of misstating \"the law and facts.\" The CFPB's suit \"includes intentional omissions\" to cover what the company called the bureau's \"overreach, it said in an email.",
      "\"Branch has provided Walmart and their driver partners valuable services allowing quick and easy access to funds via their business accounts \u2014 a key fact the bureau's press release omits,\" it said.",
      "The CFPB alleges in its suit that the two firms violated federal law for two years starting in 2021. The company and Branch are accused of using drivers' information, including their Social Security numbers, to open accounts without permission. Drivers' pay was then deposited into the accounts without their authorization, resulting in drivers paying more than $10 million in fees to Branch to instantly transfer their earnings into accounts of their choosing, the agency alleges.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:15:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "summary": "Starbucks baristas and Amazon delivery drivers are on strike in handful of U.S. cities as they seek wage increases.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years. Other publicly traded retailers, including Macy's and Kohl's, have faced pressure from major investors in order to provide bigger returns to investors, while also attempting to fend off competition from lower-cost rivals such as Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool. They will likely run the business as a retailer rather than as some kind of financial play thing which, in our view, is a very positive thing for the long term health of the brand.\"",

      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker.

      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",

    "story": [
      "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) \u2014 Marc Fogel, a Pennsylvania man imprisoned in Russia, has been designated as \"wrongfully detained,\" according to a U.S. Department of State spokesperson.",
      "That designation by the U.S. government was made official in October.",
      "Fogel is currently serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Who is Marc Fogel?",
      "When the Butler County native and his wife flew back to Russia in August 2021 for their 10th and final year of teaching in the country, Marc Fogel was detained at the airport in Moscow after his family said he was carrying 17 grams of cannabis for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "The Oakmont teacher was convicted of drug smuggling and drug possession and sentenced to 14 years at a high-security penal colony in Russia.",
      "Fight to bring Marc Fogel home",
      "Ever since his imprisonment, Marc Fogel's family and lawmakers have been urging lawmakers to bring him home.",
      "In 2022, thousands of people signed a petition calling on the U.S. government to do more to bring him home. Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",
      "In December 2022, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a prisoner swap that included WNBA player Brittney Griner, but Marc Fogel was not included in the deal.",
      "In August, another prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. brought home Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva, but not Marc Fogel.",
      "When President Biden was asked about Marc Fogel in August, he said, \"We're not giving up on that.\"",
      "An attempt was made to include Fogel in the Aug. 1 deal but officials were unable to make it happen.",
      "Malphine Fogel, Marc Fogel's mother,\u00a0has previously criticized the Biden administration\u00a0for not bringing her son home.",
      "\"I might be on borrowed time,\"\u00a0Malphine Fogel told KDKA-TV in July. \"I don't know how much time I have. I want to come home while I still know him.\"",
      "What does wrongfully detained mean?",
      "Wrongfully detained is a designation that puts the full force of the U.S. government behind securing the release of the prisoner.",
      "According to the U.S. Department of State, once a person has been determined to be wrongfully detained, offices \"throughout the State Department and other U.S. government agencies will work collaboratively with colleagues inside and outside the government to develop a strategy to secure their release.\"",
      "Getting the determination is very rare, as most cases of Americans being arrested or detained overseas \"arise out of legitimate law enforcement and judicial processes,\" according to the government.",
      "Malphine Fogel sued the government in June in an effort to get her son home from Russia, but the lawsuit was dismissed on Thursday.",
      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",
      "It also means the case gets transferred to a division known as the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, which is focused on negotiating for the release of detainees and hostages around the world.",
      "But there is no clear timeline on how long it takes to release someone.",
      "What lawmakers are saying about Marc Fogel",
      "Sen. Casey said the designation from the government is an \"important step\" but the U.S. \"must finish the job and bring Marc home.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Jan. 10 in TikTok's challenge of a law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular platform.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok urged the Supreme Court on Friday to find unconstitutional a new law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular app in the United States, arguing that shuttering TikTok will silence not only its speech, but also that of the platform's more than 170 million American users. President-elect Donald Trump also filed a separate brief in which he stated that he opposes the ban at the current moment and requests time to resolve the dispute via political negotiations.",
      "In an opening brief filed with the justices, which provides a first look at the arguments TikTok will make to the high court next month, lawyers for the platform urged them to reverse a decision from a three-judge appeals court panel that upheld the ban.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok said in their filing that they \"do not contest Congress's compelling interest in protecting this nation's security, or the many weapons it has to do so. But that arsenal simply does not include suppressing the speech of Americans because other Americans may be persuaded.\"",
      "In its own filing\u00a0laying out arguments for upholding the ban, the Justice Department argued the law is consistent with the First Amendment and said the government has a compelling interest in preventing threats to national security posed by control of TikTok by a foreign adversary, China.",
      "The law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote, \"addresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government's control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary. And the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\"",
      "The high court said last week that it would take up TikTok's challenge to the ban, which was passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. The company had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the law and urged it to intervene before Jan. 19, when the prohibition is set to take effect.",
      "The justices said they will consider whether the measure violates the First Amendment, and scheduled two hours of arguments for Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that could bring a ruling soon after. In addition to TikTok's challenge, the Supreme Court will consider a separate bid by a group of the platform's users to block the ban.",
      "The case will be argued in the final days of the Biden administration, but Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has expressed support for TikTok. Trump tried to ban the app during his first term in office, but reversed his position during his campaign. The president-elect vowed to \"save\" the app, and told reporters earlier this month that he has \"a warm spot in my heart for TikTok.\"",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Trump, D. John Sauer, said he opposes banning the platform in the U.S. \"at this juncture\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" Trump announced in November that he plans to nominate Sauer to serve as solicitor general in his second term.",
      "The president-elect asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's Jan. 19 effective date to allow his new administration to \"pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "Citing the Jan. 19 deadline, Trump said it interferes with his \"ability to manage the United States' foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\"",
      "Lawmakers sought to restrict access to TikTok in the U.S. amid concerns about its ties to China. The platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and members from both parties, as well as intelligence agencies, have warned that the app could give the Chinese government access to data from the roughly 170 million Americans who use TikTok. They have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to covertly manipulate content on the platform and influence public dialogue.",
      "Under the law, TikTok had nine months to divest from ByteDance or lose access to all app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The measure allows the president to grant a one-time, 90-day delay if a sale is in progress by Jan. 19.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that divesture is not possible, and the Chinese government has vowed to block the sale of the platform's powerful algorithm, which tailors content recommendations to users.",
      "Brought in May, TikTok argued in its challenge to the law that it violates the First Amendment rights of the platform and its users. The company also said Congress targeted it with its ban, which would bar every American from participating in its \"unique online community.\"",
      "But a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, and found that the government's national security justification for the law is consistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote for the unanimous court. \"Here the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "Ginsburg, joined by Judge Neomi Rao, tapped by Trump, and Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by President Barack Obama, said that while the decision will have significant implications for TikTok and its users, \"that burden is attributable to [China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. government.\"",

      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",

      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",

      "A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump near West Palm Beach won't be tried until September 2025, a federal judge ruled this week in Fort Pierce.",
      "Ryan Wesley Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8, 2025 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, 2025 start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.",
      "Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.",
      "Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \"unreasonable delay,\" she said.",
      "The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",

    "summary": "President Biden signed legislation Christmas Eve to make the bald eagle officially the U.S. national bird.",
    "story": [
      "The bald eagle is emblematic of America. It's on coins and bills, graces the Great Seal and inspired conservation efforts that brought the species back from the brink of extinction. Though it was first used as the national symbol more than 240 years ago, Congress had never made it official.",
      "That changed earlier this year. And on Christmas Eve,\u00a0President Biden signed\u00a0the legislation declaring the bald eagle the official national bird.",
      "\"For nearly 250 years, we called the bald eagle the national bird when it wasn't,\" said Jack Davis, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center, in a release. \"But now the title is official, and no bird is more deserving.\"",
      "It's been a long road for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the bald eagle's scientific name, known for its striking white head and yellow beak atop its brown body. Native to the U.S., populations of the bird \u2014 which eats fish and carrion, but was also known to prey on livestock, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 first declined due to habitat and prey loss.",
      "But it was the introduction of the pesticide DDT that contributed to the birds' near-disappearance in the 20th century. When the birds ate fish that had been exposed to the chemical, they laid eggs with weak shells. Those eggs didn't survive incubation, and populations declined to a mere 417 nesting pairs by 1963, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The U.S. banned DDT in 1972 and, a few years later, declared bald eagles endangered. Over the next few decades, the bald eagle\u00a0populations recovered. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000 nesting pairs in the U.S. and bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of bald eagles in recent years in the hundreds of thousands. In recent years, bald eagles have charmed\u00a0birdwatchers in the heart of New York City, and eagle cams have popped up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania and in California's Big Bear Valley.",
      "The legislation\u00a0designating the bald eagle as the U.S. national bird was spearheaded by Minnesota legislators. The state is home to what Sen. Amy Klobuchar described as one of the nation's largest bald eagle populations.",

      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",

A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",

      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday vetoed a once-bipartisan effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered about the life-tenured positions.",
      "The legislation would have spread the establishment of the new trial court judgeships over more than a decade to give three presidential administrations and six Congresses the chance to appoint the new judges. The bipartisan effort was carefully designed so that lawmakers wouldn't knowingly give an advantage to either political party in shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure unanimously in August. But the Republican-led House brought it to the floor only after Republican Donald Trump was reelected to a second term as president in November, adding the veneer of political gamesmanship to the process.",
      "The White House had said at the time that Mr. Biden would veto the bill.",
      "\"The House of Representative's hurried action fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships,\" the president said in a statement.",
      "\"The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that these questions about need and allocation be further studied and answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said the bill would also have created new judgeships in states where senators haven't filled existing judicial vacancies and that those efforts \"suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.",
      "\"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill,\" Mr. Biden said, essentially dooming the legislation for the current Congress. Overturning his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the House vote fell well short of that margin.",
      "Organizations representing judges and attorneys had urged Congress to vote for the bill. They argued that the lack of new federal judgeships had contributed to profound delays in the resolution of cases and serious concerns about access to justice.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., reacted swiftly, calling the veto a \"misguided decision\" and \"another example of why Americans are counting down the days until President Biden leaves the White House.\" He alluded to a full pardon Mr. Biden recently granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges.",
      "\"The President is more enthusiastic about using his office to provide relief to his family members who received due process than he is about giving relief to the millions of regular Americans who are waiting years for their due process,\" Young asserted. \"Biden's legacy will be 'pardons for me, no justice for thee.'\"",
      "The Senate confirmed two more of Mr. Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday \u2014 giving him a total of 235 since he took office and surpassing\u00a0the number of federal judges\u00a0approved during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Biden said in a statement at that time: \"Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water. I am proud of the legacy I will leave with our nation's judges.\"",

      "Fayetteville, Ark. \u2014 A federal judge on Monday struck down key parts of an Arkansas law that would have allowed criminal charges against librarians and booksellers for providing \"harmful\" materials to minors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks found that elements of the law are unconstitutional.",
      "\"I respect the court's ruling and will appeal,\" Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The law would have created a new process to challenge library materials and request that they be relocated to areas not accessible to children. The measure was signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2023, but an earlier ruling had temporarily blocked it from taking effect while it was being challenged in court.",
      "\"The law deputizes librarians and booksellers as the agents of censorship; when motivated by the fear of jail time, it is likely they will shelve only books fit for young children and segregate or discard the rest,\" Brooks wrote in his ruling.",
      "A coalition that included the Central Arkansas Library System in Little Rock had challenged the law, saying fear of prosecution under the measure could prompt libraries and booksellers to no longer carry titles that could be challenged.",
      "\"This was an attempt to 'thought police,' and this victory over totalitarianism is a testament to the courage of librarians, booksellers, and readers who refused to bow to intimidation,\" said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.",
      "But supporters of the law, known as Act 372, say they will continue to fight for its implementation.",
      "\"Act 372 is just common sense: schools and libraries shouldn't put obscene material in front of our kids,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement to KATV-TV. \"I will work with Attorney General Griffin to appeal this ruling and uphold Arkansas law.\"",
      "The ruling comes as lawmakers in some conservative states are pushing for measures making it easier to ban or restrict access to books.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday announced he had commuted the sentences of nearly all federal inmates on death row, with the exception of three who did not receive clemency.",
      "There are 37 inmates initially sentenced to death who will be impacted by Mr. Biden's action and will now receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. But the remaining three on death row whose sentences are untouched are: Robert Bowers, convicted for the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue; Dylann Roof, convicted of the shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for the Boston Marathon bombing.",
      "While Mr. Biden campaigned on ending capital punishment and the Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions, prosecutors still sought the death penalty in some cases.",
      "Robert Bowers",
      "Bowers, 51, received the death penalty in August 2023 after he was convicted of 63 federal counts for the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Bowers shot and killed 11 worshipers and wounded seven people in the deadliest antisemetic attack in U.S. history.",
      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers. Federal prosecutors said he turned the synagogue into a \"killing ground,\" and police said Bowers told them \"all Jews need to die.\"",
      "The Justice Department said Bowers \"meticulously planned\" the attack based on his antisemitic beliefs.",
      "Dylann Roof",
      "A jury sentenced Roof to death in 2017 for the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, making him the first person ordered to be executed for a federal hate crime. Nine Black parishioners were killed and three were wounded in the attack, which took place during a Bible study.",
      "Prosecutors said before Roof mounted the racially motivated assault, he posted a manifesto online that used racial slurs and expressed a belief that White people are superior to African Americans. They said Roof wanted to attack Black worshipers to stoke racial conflict.",
      "Roof was convicted of 33 counts in 2016. He appealed his conviction, with his attorneys arguing that Roof was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. But a federal appeals court upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence in 2021.",
      "\"Dylann Roof murdered African Americans at their church, during their Bible study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered them. He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to review\u00a0the 4th Circuit's decision in 2022.",
      "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev",
      "Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 counts for crimes committed during the bombings near the finish line at the Boston Marathon in 2013, including three counts of using a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.",
      "The jury recommended, and a federal district court imposed, the death penalty on six of 17 capital counts.",
      "Three people were killed and scores more were injured during the attack. Tsarnaev's role in the bombing is not disputed \u2014 his attorneys acknowledged he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two homemade explosive devices near the finish line of the marathon. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",
      "The two brothers attempted to flee Massachusetts following the attack, sparking a four-day manhunt that put Boston and the surrounding areas on lockdown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested by police after he was discovered hiding out in a boat behind a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police during their pursuit of the two brothers.",
      "After appealing his convictions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld nearly all of them in 2020, with the exception of three, and it invalidated those capital sentences and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the 1st Circuit's decision, arguing a new sentencing proceeding would impose significant burdens on the victims of the 2013 bombing. The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.",
      "The Supreme Court in March 2022 reinstated the death sentence, finding the appeals court improperly tossed out his capital sentences.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee on Monday released its\u00a0highly anticipated report\u00a0on the findings of its investigation into former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, detailing allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and obstruction.",
      "Gaetz has denied wrongdoing. But the report says \"[t]he Committee determined there is substantial evidence\" that he \"violated House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"",
      "Gaetz filed a federal lawsuit earlier Monday seeking to block the release of the report, arguing that the committee no longer has jurisdiction since he left office, but the committee released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz, who was first elected in 2016, resigned from Congress last month after being selected by President-elect Donald Trump as his pick for attorney general. Days later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, facing opposition\u00a0 to his confirmation from Senate Republicans.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the House Ethics Committee's report:",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz had sex with a minor",
      "The committee says in its report that there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a minor, detailing two alleged encounters with a 17-year-old girl at a party in 2017 when the former congressman was 35, in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
      "The committee said it obtained testimony from the girl, identified as \"Victim A,\" as well as other witnesses who corroborated the allegations. The report also notes that evidence suggests Gaetz was not aware that the girl was 17 until more than a month after the sexual encounters. Victim A had just completed her junior year of high school when the encounter occurred, the report says.",
      "The report says Gaetz maintained contact with Victim A, and less than six months after she turned 18, he \"met up with her again for commercial sex.\" Victim A said she received $400 from Gaetz that was understood to be payment for sex at the party, the committee said.",
      "Gaetz has previously denied these allegations and has not been charged with a crime. In a recent post on X, he wrote: \"I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18.\u00a0 Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court - which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz paid women for sex",
      "The report found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz paid women for sex and had others pay them on his behalf, in violation of Florida state law.",
      "The report lists payments to 12 different women totaling more than $90,000 between 2017 and 2020, paid via check or apps like PayPal, Venmo and CashApp.",
      "The report notes that there was no evidence that the sex acts were \"induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "One of the women testified that she met up with Gaetz at a hotel, where he was with another man and a 20-year-old woman, and there was an \"expectation\" of a \"sexual encounter,\" after which he gave her a $750 check with \"tuition reimbursement\" written in the memo line. She told the committee that on other occasions \"he had normally sent Venmo payments.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied paying for sex. He wrote on X: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used illegal drugs",
      "The report says there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz used illegal drugs between 2017 to 2019, including cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana, in violation of state laws.",
      "A number of women understood Gaetz to be a regular user of ecstasy, the report says, while some noted that they had seen him use ecstasy and cocaine at different events. The report says Gaetz appeared to set up a \"pseudonymous e-mail account from his House office in the Capitol complex for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\"",
      "The committee noted that it also received evidence that Gaetz provided drugs to",
      "women to facilitate sexual encounters.",
      "Gaetz wrote on X: \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life.\u00a0 I live a different life now.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz accepted luxury travel gifts in violation of House rules",
      "The committee outlines \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz accepted gifts exceeding the amount allowed under House rules, in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas.",
      "Lawmakers are required to apply to the committee for a waiver in order to accept gifts that surpass a certain cost threshold. The committee said for Gaetz, a flight on a private plane, lodging, meal expenses and entertainment expenses on the trip exceeded the limit.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used the power of his office to help a sexual partner get an expedited passport",
      "The panel alleges that Gaetz falsely indicated to the State Department that a woman whom he had engaged in sexual activity with was a constituent, and asked his chief of staff to assist her in getting a passport on an expedited basis.",
      "\"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases,\" the report says, calling it a violation of House regulations and laws governing the use of official resources.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz tried to obstruct the committee's investigation",
      "The report says Gaetz was uncooperative throughout the committee's investigation, provided \"minimal documentation\" in response to its requests, and did not agree to a voluntary interview or appear before the committee after a subpoena for his testimony.",
      "The committee says it found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in \"obstructive conduct\" when it came to the investigation.",

      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.",

      "Pillen had been riding a new horse with members of his family when the incident occurred, his office said. The 68-year-old Republican was initially taken to Columbus Community Hospital and then, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" to Omaha's University of Nebraska Medical Center, his office initially said.",
      "\"Gov. Pillen was transported to Nebraska Medicine Sunday afternoon after a horseback riding accident while riding with his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter near Columbus,\" Pillen's office said in a follow-up statement Monday. \"The governor's injuries included minor lacerations to his spleen and kidney, seven broken ribs, a partially collapsed lung resulting from the rib damage, and a minor fracture in one of his vertebrae. There were no injuries to his neck, head, nervous system or additional internal organs.\"",
      "Pillen's office said he is in \"stable condition and is expected to remain in the hospital a few days for observation, particularly for the recovery of his rib injuries.\" He expects to conduct work from his hospital room.",
      "\"In summary, the governor's injuries were serious but not life-threatening and could have been much worse,\" his office said.",
      "The governor underwent what's called a coil embolization, a procedure to address minor bleeding from his spleen. His office said the procedure took less than an hour and included anesthesia, during which time, Nebraska Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly briefly acted as governor.",
      "Pillen's office called the procedure a \"success\" and said Pillen caught the second half a Nebraska basketball game from his hospital room, while talking with his family and team.",
      "Pillen is currently in his first term as governor, having been elected in 2022 after former Gov. Pete Ricketts was term-limited. Pillen then appointed Ricketts to the U.S. Senate to fill the seat vacated when Ben Sasse resigned to become president of the University of Florida.",

    "story": [
      "A retired Washington, D.C., police officer\u00a0was convicted Monday of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the far-right Proud Boys.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson convicted former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond, who used to supervise the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau, of obstructing justice and making false statements after a trial without a jury.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond was convicted on all four counts. He was charged with leaking information to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "At his bench trial, Lamond testified that he had never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio testified as a witness for Lamond's defense and said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn't receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find the testimony of either Lamond or Tarrio to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the banner burning.",
      "\"It was the other way around,\" she said.",
      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",
      "After the verdict, defense attorney Mark Schamel said it was premature to say if there would be an appeal.",
      "\"It's unbelievably disappointing to see every single thing that Lt. Lamond did viewed through a lens to make it appear to be something other than it was,\" Schamel said outside the courtroom. \"There is nothing disloyal about him at all, and it's a sad day for him.\"",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \"real-time updates\" on the police investigation of the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, was charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. He retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.",

      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",

The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E.

      "In February 2025, NASA plans to launch the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, or SPHEREx, observatory. This mission will survey the sky in near-infrared light, which is a type of light that is invisible to the naked eye but that special instruments can detect. Near-infrared light is useful for observing objects that are too cool or too distant to be seen in visible light.",
      "SPHEREx will create a comprehensive map of the universe by surveying and collecting data on more than 450 million galaxies along with over 100 million stars in the Milky Way. Astronomers will use this data to answer big questions about the origins of galaxies and the distribution of water and organic molecules in stellar nurseries \u2013 where stars are born from gas and dust.",
      "Studying low Earth orbit with Space Rider",
      "The European Space Agency, or ESA, plans to conduct an orbital test flight of its Space Rider uncrewed spaceplane in the third quarter of 2025. Space Rider is a reusable spacecraft designed to carry out various scientific experiments in low Earth orbit.",
      "These scientific experiments will include research in microgravity, which is the near-weightless environment of space. Scientists will study how plants grow, how materials behave and how biological processes occur without the influence of gravity.",
      "Space Rider will also demonstrate new technologies for future missions. For example, it will test advanced telecommunication systems, which are crucial for maintaining communication with spacecraft over long distances. It will also test new robotic exploration tools for use on future missions to the moon or Mars.",
      "Exploring the moon with M2/Resilience",
      "Japan's M2/Resilience mission, scheduled for January 2025, will launch a lander and micro-rover to the lunar surface.",
      "This mission will study the lunar soil to understand its composition and properties. Researchers will also conduct a water-splitting test to produce oxygen and hydrogen by extracting water from the lunar surface, heating the water and splitting the captured steam. The generated water, oxygen and hydrogen can be used for enabling long-term lunar exploration.",
      "This mission will also demonstrate new technologies, such as advanced navigation systems for precise landings and systems to operate the rover autonomously. These technologies are essential for future lunar exploration and could be used in missions to Mars and beyond.",
      "The M2/Resilience mission is part of Japan's broader efforts to contribute to international lunar exploration. It builds on the success of Japan's Smart Lander for Investigating moon, or SLIM, mission, which landed on the moon using a precise landing technique in March 2024.",
      "Investigating an asteroid with Tianwen-2",
      "China's Tianwen-2 mission is an ambitious asteroid sample return and comet probe mission. Scheduled for launch in May 2025, Tianwen-2 aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid and study a comet. This mission will advance scientists' understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution, building on the success of China's previous lunar and Mars missions.",
      "The mission's first target is the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa. This asteroid is a quasi-satellite of Earth, meaning it orbits the Sun but stays close to Earth. Kamo\u02bboalewa is roughly 131-328 feet (40-100 meters) in diameter and may be a fragment of the ,oon, ejected into space by a past impact event.",
      "By studying this asteroid, scientists hope to learn about the early solar system and the processes that shaped it. The spacecraft will use both touch-and-go and anchor-and-attach techniques to collect samples from the asteroid's surface.",
      "After collecting samples from Kamo\u02bboalewa, Tianwen-2 will return them to Earth and then set course for its second target, the main-belt comet 311P/PANSTARRS. This comet is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.",
      "By analyzing the comet's materials, researchers hope to learn more about the conditions that existed in the early solar system and possibly the origins of water and organic molecules on Earth.",
      "Solar system flybys",
      "Besides the above planned launch missions, several space agencies plan to perform exciting deep-space flyby missions in 2025.",
      "A flyby, or gravity assist, is when a spacecraft passes close enough to a planet or moon to use its gravity for a speed boost. As the spacecraft approaches, it gets pulled in by the planet's gravity, which helps it accelerate.",
      "After swinging around the planet, the spacecraft is flung back out into space, allowing it to change direction and continue on its intended path using less fuel.",
      "BepiColombo, a joint mission by ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, will make its sixth flyby of Mercury in January 2025.

    "summary": "Despite the hype over artificial intelligence in medicine, the systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and maintain.",
    "story": [
      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",
      "Experts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money \u2014 a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.",
      "\"It's great to have a vision where we're melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,\" Shah said. \"But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok urged the Supreme Court on Friday to find unconstitutional a new law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular app in the United States, arguing that shuttering TikTok will silence not only its speech, but also that of the platform's more than 170 million American users. President-elect Donald Trump also filed a separate brief in which he stated that he opposes the ban at the current moment and requests time to resolve the dispute via political negotiations.",
      "In an opening brief filed with the justices, which provides a first look at the arguments TikTok will make to the high court next month, lawyers for the platform urged them to reverse a decision from a three-judge appeals court panel that upheld the ban.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok said in their filing that they \"do not contest Congress's compelling interest in protecting this nation's security, or the many weapons it has to do so. But that arsenal simply does not include suppressing the speech of Americans because other Americans may be persuaded.\"",
      "In its own filing\u00a0laying out arguments for upholding the ban, the Justice Department argued the law is consistent with the First Amendment and said the government has a compelling interest in preventing threats to national security posed by control of TikTok by a foreign adversary, China.",
      "The law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote, \"addresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government's control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary. And the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\"",
      "The high court said last week that it would take up TikTok's challenge to the ban, which was passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. The company had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the law and urged it to intervene before Jan. 19, when the prohibition is set to take effect.",
      "The justices said they will consider whether the measure violates the First Amendment, and scheduled two hours of arguments for Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that could bring a ruling soon after. In addition to TikTok's challenge, the Supreme Court will consider a separate bid by a group of the platform's users to block the ban.",
      "The case will be argued in the final days of the Biden administration, but Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has expressed support for TikTok.

      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Trump, D. John Sauer, said he opposes banning the platform in the U.S. \"at this juncture\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" Trump announced in November that he plans to nominate Sauer to serve as solicitor general in his second term.",
      "The president-elect asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's Jan. 19 effective date to allow his new administration to \"pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "Citing the Jan. 19 deadline, Trump said it interferes with his \"ability to manage the United States' foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\"",
      "Lawmakers sought to restrict access to TikTok in the U.S. amid concerns about its ties to China. The platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and members from both parties, as well as intelligence agencies, have warned that the app could give the Chinese government access to data from the roughly 170 million Americans who use TikTok. They have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to covertly manipulate content on the platform and influence public dialogue.",
      "Under the law, TikTok had nine months to divest from ByteDance or lose access to all app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The measure allows the president to grant a one-time, 90-day delay if a sale is in progress by Jan. 19.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that divesture is not possible, and the Chinese government has vowed to block the sale of the platform's powerful algorithm, which tailors content recommendations to users.",
      "Brought in May, TikTok argued in its challenge to the law that it violates the First Amendment rights of the platform and its users. The company also said Congress targeted it with its ban, which would bar every American from participating in its \"unique online community.\"",
      "But a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, and found that the government's national security justification for the law is consistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote for the unanimous court. \"Here the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "Ginsburg, joined by Judge Neomi Rao, tapped by Trump, and Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by President Barack Obama, said that while the decision will have significant implications for TikTok and its users, \"that burden is attributable to [China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. government.\"",
      "The dispute has attracted a range of friend-of-the-court briefs from members of Congress, civil liberties groups, former national security officials and TikTok users.",

      "National Park officials urged caution after a toddler nearly fell off a 400-foot cliff while the family visited erupting volcano K\u012blauea. After a three-month pause the\u00a0Kilauea Volcano\u00a0in Hawaii started erupting on Dec. 23, the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.",
      "The toddler had wandered off from his family \"in a split second,\" park officials said, as they were admiring the lava glow within Kaluapele - the Kilauea caldera - at sunset on Dec. 23. He ran straight toward the 400-foot cliff edge and his screaming mother managed to grab him in the nick of time just a foot or so away from a fatal fall, officials said.",
      "\"The hazards that coincide with an eruption are dangerous, and we have safety measures in place including closed areas, barriers, closure signs, and traffic management,\" Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh said in a statement. \"Your safety is our utmost concern, but we rely on everyone to recreate responsibility. National parks showcase nature's splendor but they are not playgrounds.\"",
      "Park officials said the family was behind a closed area beyond the post-and-cable barrier at K\u012blauea Overlook. Officials reminded visitors to stay on the trail, stay out of closed areas and to keep their children close - especially when watching K\u012blauea from viewpoints along Crater Rim Trail.",
      "The volcano eruption from Dec. 23rd has entered its second pause, said the UGSG, but eruptions could start any time. Toxic gas emissions are still high and can be particularly dangerous for children. Volcanic gas includes sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide.",
      "The December 2024 eruption - had lava fountains as high as 262 feet with molten material - and was the fifth eruption at Kilauea since December 2020. Roughly 400 acres of the caldera floor was covered in lava, according to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "But Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign.",
      "He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

    "story": [
      "More than 2 years after Tennessee abruptly halted the execution of inmate Oscar Smith \u2014 admitting that correction officials were not following their own execution protocols \u2014 the state has announced a new method that could allow it to resume executions halted since May 2022. But that won't happen right away.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction announced in a brief statement Friday it had \"completed its revision of the lethal injection protocol, which will utilize the single drug pentobarbital.\" The Department did not immediately release the new protocol to the public or give any further details.",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender's habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee's death row inmates, said the announcement was \"notable for its lack of detail.\"",
      "\"The secrecy which shrouds the execution protocol in Tennessee is what allowed TDOC to perform executions in violation of their own protocol while simultaneously misrepresenting their actions to the courts and the public,\" Henry said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "Smith was convicted of fatally stabbing his estranged wife and her sons decades ago. He was initially set to be executed in June 2020, but it was delayed because of the pandemic. Shortly before the 2022 date, his attorneys asked Gov. Bill Lee for clemency, citing jury problems in the 1990 trial, but Lee declined to intervene. The U.S. Supreme Court also declined to take up the case.",
      "Smith's 11th-hour reprieve from execution came after Henry requested the results of required purity and potency tests for the lethal injection drugs that were to be used on him. Documents obtained through a public records request later showed that at least two people knew that the lethal injection drugs the state planned to use hadn't undergone some required testing. A subsequent independent review found the state had has not complied with its own lethal injection process ever since it was revised in 2018.",
      "Commissioner Frank Strada took over the Correction Department in January 2023, the same month its top attorney and inspector general were fired. Strada said in Friday's statement he is \"confident the lethal injection process can proceed in compliance with departmental policy and state laws.\"",

They put the case on hold pending the state's review and revision of the procedure.

    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carter's attorneys for comment.",
      "Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs.",
      "The lawsuits allege many individuals were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida after receiving drug-laced drinks.",
      "Combs' lawyers have dismissed Buzbee's lawsuits as \"shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\" Jay-Z has said in a statement that Buzbee is trying to blackmail him to settle the Alabama woman's allegations.",
      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",
      "Spiro asked the judge to dismiss the entertainer from the woman's lawsuit and he requested a hearing on the case for the day after he made his requests in writing on Dec. 18.",
      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story. For one thing, the woman said she traveled for five hours from Rochester to watch the music awards show on a jumbotron outside the VMAs even though permits and pictures show there was no jumbotron at the event.",
      "Spiro also noted that the woman's father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick his daughter up in New York City, as she says he did.",
      "In the interview, the woman admitted to inconsistencies in her story.",

      "After a Utah man accidentally triggered an avalanche while riding a snowmobile on Christmas Eve, he was able to rescue his brother and return to safety.",
      "The unidentified pair of brothers and their father were snowmobiling in the Steep Hollow area of the Logan Canyon, a series of hiking trails in Cache County, Utah. The younger brother was riding across a slope when he triggered the avalanche, the Utah Avalanche Center said in a news release.",
      "The younger brother saw the snow ripple below and around his sled and was able to ride off the avalanche, but watched as it \"swept up and carried his older brother,\" who had not been on his snowmobile at the time of the incident, the UAC said. The avalanche carried the older brother and his snowmobile about 100 yards and through a group of trees, partially burying the machine and completely burying the older brother.",
      "The brothers' father was stuck below the avalanche, but climbed up to try to search for his sons. He was hampered by snow that \"was deep and completely unsupportable,\" and became trapped up to his waist.",
      "The younger brother was able to get close enough to where his older brother was trapped to see \"a couple of fingers\" sticking out of the snow. The younger brother was able to dig him out of the drifts.",
      "The two brothers doubled up on one snowmobile and rode out of the area. Their father was able to get out of the snow and ride out as well.",
      "The older brother broke a leg in the incident, according to the UAC. The center said that on Dec. 26, its staff went to the scene of the accident and recovered the older brother's \"bent-up and broken snowmobile\" and the airbag had deployed when he was caught in the avalanche.",
      "\"The damage to the sled, the airbag, and the rider was caused by all being dragged violently through a group of trees by the avalanche,\" the UAC said.",
      "The UAC warned that similar avalanche conditions \"are widespread in the area and that the danger will be rising across the mountains of Northern Utah and Southeast Idaho as we head into the weekend.\"",
      "Avalanches can occur on any steep slope, given the right conditions, according to the National Weather Service. Warning signs include cracks forming in the snow around a person's feet or skis, a feeling of hollow ground, a \"whumping\" sound while walking, or surface patterns made by strong winds. Heavy snowfall or rain, or significant warming in recent days, could also be a warning sign for an avalanche, according to the NWS.",
      "To stay safe in case of an avalanche, the NWS recommends following advisories from regional avalanche centers, who will have up-to-date local information. Those going out in the snow should bring a transceiver so they can be found if they are buried in the snow, a shovel so they can help dig if someone is trapped, and a probe that can help locate someone covered by snow.",

      "A NASA spacecraft made history and is safe after making the closest-ever approach to the sun. On Tuesday, the Parker Solar Probe\u00a0hurtled through the sizzling solar atmosphere and passed within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles of the sun's surface.",
      "Just before midnight Thursday, scientists at NASA\u00a0received a signal from the probe after it had been out of communication for several days during its burning-hot flyby.",

      "Parker got more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, traveling at a maximum speed of about 430,000 mph. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).",
      "It will continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Since it was launched, Parker has been using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.",

    "summary": "Richard Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager.",
    "story": [
      "Richard Parsons, one of corporate America's most prominent Black executives who held top posts at Time Warner and Citigroup, died Thursday, the financial services company Lazard, where Parsons was a longtime board member, announced. He was 76.",
      "\"Dick was the leader to whom other leaders turned for advice and a steady, sure set of hands during their most consequential moments,\" Lazard said in a statement.",
      "Parsons, who died at his Manhattan home, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and cited \"unanticipated complications\" from the disease for cutting back on work a few years later.",
      "The NBA, where Parsons was interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014, was among organizations offering condolences.",
      "\"Dick Parsons was a brilliant and transformational leader and a giant of the media industry who led with integrity and never shied away from a challenge,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Parsons' friend Ronald Lauder told The New York Times that the cause of death was cancer. Parsons stepped down Dec. 3 from the boards of Lazard and Lauder's company, Est\u00e9e Lauder, citing health reasons. He had been on Est\u00e9e Lauder's board for 25 years.",
      "Parsons, a Brooklyn native who started college at 16, was named chairman of Citigroup in 2009, one month after leaving Time Warner Inc., where he helped restore the company's stature following its much-maligned acquisition by internet provider America Online Inc.",
      "He steered Citigroup back to profit after financial turmoil from the subprime mortgage crisis, which upended the economy in 2007 and 2008.",
      "Parsons was named interim chairman of CBS' board of directors in September 2018 but resigned a month later because of illness.",
      "Parsons said in a statement at the time that he was already dealing with multiple myeloma when he joined the board, but \"unanticipated complications have created additional new challenges.\" He said his doctors advised him to cut back on his commitments to ensure recovery.",
      "\"Dick's storied career embodied the finest traditions of American business leadership,\" Lazard said in a statement. The company, where Parsons was a board member from 2012 until this month, praised his \"unmistakable intelligence and his irresistible warmth.\"",
      "\"Dick was more than an iconic leader in Lazard's history \u2014 he was a testament to how wisdom, warmth, and unwavering judgment could shape not just companies, but people's lives,\" the company said. \"His legacy lives on in the countless leaders he counseled, the institutions he renewed, and the doors he opened for others.\"",
      "Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager.",
      "Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division.",
      "He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL.",
      "Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions.",
      "In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of Internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. In that role, he was in charge of the company's content businesses, including movie studios and recorded music.",
      "He became CEO in 2002 with the retirement of Gerald Levin, one of the key architects of that merger. Parsons was named Time Warner chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination.",
      "The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies.",
      "Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company, following years of struggles to reinvent itself as a business focused on advertising and content. Time Warner is now owned by AT&T Inc.",
      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",
      "Citigroup returned to profit under Parsons, starting in 2010, and would not have a quarterly loss again until the fourth quarter of 2017. Parsons retired from that job in 2012.",
      "In 2014 he stepped in as interim CEO of the Clippers until Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer took over later that year.",
      "Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team.",
      "Parsons, who loved jazz and co-owned a Harlem jazz club, also served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. And he held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
      "Parsons played basketball at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their family.",

Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",

      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",

      "Officials are trying to determine what caused the\u00a0Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash\u00a0in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day that killed 38 people on board, leaving 29 survivors, as speculation mounts that Russia's military could have had a role in the disaster.",
      "Here is what we know so far:",
      "How did the plane crash?",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, an Embraer 190 aircraft, was flying from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the city of Grozny in Russia's North Caucasus region on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that aren't yet fully clear.",
      "It crashed while trying to reach another airport in Aktau, in western Kazakhstan.",
      "Cellphone footage appears to show the aircraft making a steep descent before hitting the ground and exploding in a fireball about two miles from the Aktau airport.",
      "Photos from the scene show the rear portion of the plane's fuselage still intact after the crash, lying upside down in a field.",
      "The airline said 67 people were on board \u2014 62 passengers and five crew members \u2014 and 38 people died in the crash, but 29 of those on board survived.",
      "Investigators have recovered both of the so-called black boxes, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, from the crash site.",
      "Why did the plane change course?",
      "There were conflicting accounts of why the plane's pilots diverted the aircraft.",
      "Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, initially said it appeared the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike. Later, Russian and Azerbaijani officials suggested the plane had been rerouted due to fog or bad weather in Grozny. Then Russia also said Ukrainian drones targeting the Grozny area were a factor.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that while it was too soon to know the cause of the crash, bad weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.",
      "\"The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,\" he said.",
      "Dmitry Yadrov, the head of Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic.",
      "Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea, instead.",
      "What do officials and aviation experts say about a possible cause?",
      "Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia all opened investigations into the cause of the crash. The Kremlin has urged people not to jump to conclusions.",
      "In a statement on Friday, Dec. 27, Azerbaijan Airlines said the plane experienced \"external physical and technical interference,\" but did not say where it believed the interference came from or provide any further details. It announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News there were early indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the plane in a region where Ukrainian and Russian forces have traded drone and rocket fire for months. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said if that proved to be true, it would further underscore Russia's recklessness in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that U.S. officials \"have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.\"",
      "He confirmed to reporters that the U.S. has intelligence or information pointing to the possibility, but said Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are currently conducting the investigation and the U.S. will \"respect that process.\"",
      "Meanwhile, independent aviation experts cast doubt on the bird strike theory, and some pointed to damage seen on the plane's fuselage as evidence it may have come under fire.",
      "\"It certainly does not look like a flock of birds,\" said CBS News aviation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "\"Birds don't fly at the type of altitude that the initial damage occurred on this airplane,\" added Sumwalt.",
      "Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal the damage compatible with shrapnel from a small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system.",
      "\"It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,\" he said.",
      "Speaking to reporters on a conference call Dec. 27, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the claims of possible Russian involvement in the crash, saying it would be up to investigators to determine the cause.",
      "Survivors heard noises before crash",
      "Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny.",
      "Flight attendant Aydan Rahimli said that after one noise, the oxygen masks automatically released. She said that she went to perform first aid on a colleague, Zulfugar Asadov, and then they heard another bang.",
      "Asadov said that the noises sounded like something hitting the plane from outside. Shortly afterward, he sustained a sudden injury, like a \"deep wound, the arm was lacerated as if someone hit me in the arm with an ax,\" he said. He denied a claim from Kazakh officials that an oxygen canister exploded inside the plane.",
      "Two other survivors recounted hearing explosions before the plane went down: Jerova Salihat told Azerbaijani television in an interview in the hospital that \"something exploded\" near her leg, and Vafa Shabanova said that \"there were two explosions in the sky, and an hour and a half later the plane crashed to the ground.\"",

      "For many observers, the circumstances of the Azerbaijan Airlines crash and the damage to the plane's wreckage recalled the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014.

    "story": [
      "The Israeli military said airstrikes in Yemen on Thursday targeted the Houthi rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida. The World Health Organization's director-general said the bombardment occurred as he was about to board a flight in Sanaa, injuring a crew member. Israel's army later told The Associated Press it wasn't aware that the WHO chief was at the location.",
      "\"The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge \u2014 just a few meters from where we were \u2014 and the runway were damaged,\" WHO's Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, adding that he and his colleagues were safe. \"We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave.\" He didn't mention the source of the bombardment.",
      "Tedros said at least two people were killed in the attack at the airport. On Friday, he said in a short message posted on social media that, along with the injured member of his flight crew, the WHO entourage had been evacuated to Jordan, where the wounded United Nations Humanitarian Air Service member would receive further medical treatment.",
      "\"Deepest gratitude to the UNHAS team for their service and swift evacuation from #Yemen, where we were on a UN mission to negotiate for the release of detained colleagues,\" Tedros said, adding: \"Attacks on civilians and humanitarians must stop, everywhere.\"",
      "According to BBC News, video from inside the airport showed panicked people running out of the terminal immediately after the strike.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Yemen came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"the Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad's regime and others learned.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said targets included \"military infrastructure used by the Houthi terrorist regime for its military activities in both the Sana'a International Airport and the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations,\" as well as other military infrastructure at several ports.",
      "The Iran-backed Houthis' media outlet confirmed the strikes in a Telegram post but gave no immediate details. Houthi media said three people were killed in the strikes and 14 injured.",
      "The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen for months, including in recent days, in response to the group's regular missile and drone attacks on international commercial and military ships and on Israel. Israeli officials said yet another Houthi-launched missile was intercepted by air defense systems Friday before it reached Israeli territory.",
      "The United Nations has noted that the rebel-held ports in Yemen are important entryways for humanitarian aid to the impoverished nation. According to BBC News, Tedros was in Yemen to assess the humanitarian situation there, in addition to trying to negotiate the release of detained U.N. staff in the country.",
      "Over the weekend, 16 people were wounded when a Houthi missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv. Last week, Israeli jets struck Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people, calling it a response to previous Houthi attacks. The Houthis also have been targeting shipping on the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Israeli strike outside hospital in Gaza",
      "Meanwhile, an Israeli strike killed five Palestinians outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the territory's Health Ministry said. Gaza officials said they were journalists working for a local news outlet. The Israeli military said they were militants posing as reporters.",
      "The strike hit a car outside Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian Journalists Union said the victims were working for the local news outlet Al-Quds Today, a television channel affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group, Reuters reported.",
      "Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme ally of Hamas and took part in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel, which ignited the war. The Israeli military identified four of the men as combat propagandists and said that intelligence, including a list of Islamic Jihad operatives found by soldiers in Gaza, had confirmed that all five were affiliated with the group.",
      "Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian militant groups operate political, media and charitable operations in addition to their armed wings.",
      "Associated Press footage showed the incinerated shell of a van, with press markings visible on the back doors. Sobbing young men attended the funeral outside the hospital. The bodies were wrapped in shrouds, with blue press vests draped over them.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists says that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel hasn't allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza except on military embeds.",
      "Israel has banned the pan-Arab Al Jazeera network and accused six of its Gaza reporters of being militants. The Qatar-based broadcaster denies the allegations and accuses Israel of trying to silence its war coverage, which has focused heavily on civilian casualties from Israeli military operations.",
      "Separately, Israel's military said that a 35-year-old reserve soldier was killed during fighting in central Gaza early Thursday. A total of 389 soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation more than a year ago.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in an attack on nearby army bases, farming communities and a music festival. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. About 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",

      "Iran's government had not acknowledged Sala's arrest by Friday, and none of the country's official media outlets were reporting about it.

      "Osamu Suzuki, the charismatic former boss of Suzuki Motor Corp. who helped turn the Japanese mini-vehicle maker into a globally competitive company, has died, the company said Friday. He was 94.",
      "Suzuki was known for his candid remarks and friendliness, calling himself an \"old guy from a small to mid-size company.\" He became CEO of Suzuki in 1978 and was leading the company when it became the first Japanese automaker to start local production in India, where its cars proved hugely popular.",
      "Born on Jan. 30, 1930 as Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki worked in banking after graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University School of Law. He joined Suzuki Motor, which is based in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu, in 1958 when he married a daughter of the company's then-president Shunzo Suzuki, who belonged to the company's founding family. As is sometimes the custom in such situations, Matsuda adopted his wife's maiden name.",

      "Suzuki also led business tie-ups with other global leaders such as General Motors and Volkswagen AG in the 2000s. Amid intensifying competition and industrial transformation, Suzuki also formed a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp. in 2019 to co-develop self-driving vehicles.",
      "While other Japanese automakers have expanded in the U.S. and Chinese markets, offering a wide range of vehicles, Suzuki has stuck with mini and compact cars, mostly in South and Southeast Asia.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 08:38:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers say human-caused climate change dealt people an average of nearly six weeks of extra extreme heat in 2024, while also fueling more destructive storms.",
    "story": [
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record. Heat across the globe likely made 2024 the hottest year ever measured and contributed to a slew of other fatal weather events that spared few.",
      "\"The finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\" Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings.",
      "\"As long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse,\" Otto warned.",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures.",
      "Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change, they found.",
      "\"The poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\" said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\"People don't have to die in heat waves. But if we can't communicate convincingly, 'but actually a lot of people are dying,' it's much harder to raise this awareness,\" Otto said. \"Heat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\"",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that, in aggregate, killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. However, the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn't involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\"Extreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Program said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "\"Countries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad",
      "The warnings come amid concern in many countries that the U.S. government, under President-elect Donald Trump, will\u00a0start to roll back commitments\u00a0made by Washington in January to slash greenhouse gas emissions and work toward transitioning to more sustainable energy production.",
      "Trump has made it clear that\u00a0he believes fears about climate change are overblown, and he's previously dismissed the notion of human-caused global warming as a hoax. In his first term as president, Trump overturned\u00a0100 environmental rules\u00a0enacted by his predecessor Barack Obama.",

    "summary": "South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo, further deepening the country's political crisis.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country's political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol's stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Han's impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country's top two officials worsen its political turmoil, deepen its economic uncertainty and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han's impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and gathered around the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated and shouted that the vote was \"invalid\" and demanded Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported.",
      "The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han's impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-memer assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president's impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",
      "Han's powers will be officially suspended when copies of his impeachment document are delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, will take over.",
      "Agence France-Presse points out that PPP leader Kweon Seong-dong said after the vote that Han \"must continue to lead state affairs without yielding to the opposition's passage of the impeachment motion.\"",
      "But Han said in a statement that he \"respects the parliament's decision\" and would wait for the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision whether to uphold it.",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon's martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party's demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon's impeachment. That's a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon's ouster. Yoon's political allies in the governing People Power Party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn't exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn't appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. The Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon's decree.",

He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party's crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India's \"most distinguished leaders\" who rose from humble origins and left \"a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\"",

He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as economic advisor in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India's second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India's Upper House of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country's top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country's various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India's nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with Communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",

      "Some believe that Boxing Day began with churches collecting alms boxes of parishioners' donated money, according to Britannica. The church would give these boxes of donations to the poor the day after Christmas.",
      "The name has stuck, but now, people typically donate to charity in the weeks leading up to the holidays.",
      "Others believe that the day was observed because servants had to work at Christmas dinners and festivities, so they celebrated the holiday on Dec. 26. According to History.com, the lords and aristocrats would give their servants \"Christmas boxes\" filled with leftovers and small gifts after the parties, leading to the name \"Boxing Day.\"",
      "Employers still give service workers bonuses around the holidays, just as leftovers still are a part of celebrations today.",
      "A third theory, according to TimeOut, is that British naval ships would seal a box of money at the start of a long voyage, and at the end, priests would open the boxes and donate the money to those in need.",
      "McLean said other theories about the name include bare-knuckle boxing matches that occurred the day after Christmas, or that many people return their boxes of unwanted gifts that day.",
      "Is Boxing Day an official holiday?",
      "Yes, Boxing Day is a public or bank holiday recognized in the U.K. and other countries. It was made an official U.K. holiday in the 1800s. If Dec. 26 falls on a weekend, it is recognized on the following Monday. In 2024, it falls on a Thursday and in 2025, it will fall on a Friday.",
      "Where is it celebrated?",
      "Countries that are a part of the British Commonwealth like Australia, Canada and New Zealand celebrate but some former colonies like South Africa and Hong Kong also recognize the holiday.",
      "However, people can celebrate anywhere, as demonstrated by the McLeans' party. Even though some of their American friends work on the 26th, people gather at their house in the evening for a spirited pub quiz, yummy leftovers and mulled wine.",
      "Is Boxing Day the same as St. Stephen's Day?",
      "Not necessarily, because St. Stephen's Day is a religious holiday, but the two are linked and are recognized on the same day. Christians observe St. Stephen's Day in celebration of the first Christian martyr who was known for helping the poor and for his charitable work. St. Stephen's Day is more widely recognized in Ireland and other European countries.",
      "Why don't Americans recognize Boxing Day?",
      "The U.S. is one of the few English-speaking countries that does not recognize Boxing Day. Americans don't celebrate mainly because the country is not part of the British Commonwealth and the holiday did not become officially recognized until 1871, almost a century after the U.S. gained independence.",
      "What sporting events are happening on Boxing Day this year?",
      "Unlike in the U.S., where Americans can expect an NBA game on Christmas, Boxing Day is where U.K. competition goes down.",
      "Eight Premiere League soccer games are set to compete on Dec. 26. In GMT, the games are:",
      "Manchester City vs Everton at 12:30Bournemouth vs Crystal Palace at 15:00Chelsea vs Fulham at 15:00Newcastle vs Aston Villa at 15:00Nottingham Forest vs Tottenham at 15:00Southampton vs West Ham at 15:00Wolves vs Manchester United at 17:30Liverpool vs Leicester at 20:00",

      "11 horse races are also lined up for Boxing Day.",
      "McLean emphasized the joy of sharing British culture with American friends.",
      "\"It's just, it's a great thing to be able to bring people together, not just on the days that everyone celebrates.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about the United States' involvement with building and operating the Panama Canal.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States take over the Panama Canal, a shipping waterway that cuts across Central America, unless fees for using the canal are lowered.",
      "Panama's leader shot back in a recent statement, saying the waterway is not for sale. Since then, Trump has posted repeatedly about the canal.",
      "It's the latest in a series of similar statements from Trump, who recently suggested the United States take over Greenland, an idea he also floated during his first presidency. He's also joked about Canada\u00a0being a U.S. state.",
      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",
      "Mulino said that while there are \"delicate problems such as immigration\" that both he and Trump \"are concerned about as presidents,\" the two leaders have \"nothing to discuss\" as far as ownership of the Panama Canal.",
      "\"The specific approach, the Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians, there is no possibility of opening any kind of conversation about this reality that has cost the country tears, sweat and blood to achieve,\" Mulino said.",

It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered.",
      "\"We miss them and we still don't know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,\" said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies.",

      "The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Waves towering up to 100 feet high swept away nearly everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 in their path.",
      "Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.",
      "More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone.",

      "Hundreds of people gathered to pray at the Baiturrahman Mosque in downtown Banda Aceh. Sirens sounded across the city for three minutes to mark the time of the earthquake.",
      "Indonesia, which is located along the fault lines that make up the\u00a0Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. It suffered another disaster in 2018 when huge waves were triggered by an earthquake in Sulawesi, killing thousands.",
      "In the years since 2004, infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety.",
      "The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed.",
      "In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country.",
      "The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation's history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed.",
      "Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village's tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers.",
      "Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it.",
      "\"I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I'm very angry with it. I can't even put my foot in the water,\" she said.",

      "In India, hundreds gathered at Marina beach in the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. They poured milk into the sea to propitiate gods and offered flowers and prayers for the dead as drums beat in the background.",
      "According to official data, 10,749 people were killed in India, including nearly 7,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone.",
      "\"It has been 20 years since the tsunami,\" said 69-year-old Sadayammal, who uses one name. \"We are here to pay respects to the people who lost their lives.\"",
      "In Sri Lanka, survivors and relatives of tsunami victims gathered at the coastal village of Pereliya and laid flowers at a memorial that commemorates nearly 2,000 passengers who died when their train, the Queen of the Sea, was hit by the wave. Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived.",
      "Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day.",
      "\"I looked for them everywhere for years and still, no information about them. Their loss is a great sorrow and pain for me. I am still grieving,\" he said.",

      "There was little to no warning at the time, but in the years since the 2004 disaster, a tsunami warning system has been put into place to help protect the region. A network of seismometers to detect undersea earthquakes, along with tidal gauges and ocean buoys, can pick up early signals of the tremors that generate tsunamis, and improved communication networks help get those warnings to officials around the globe.",

      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has become a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Even though Andrew had stepped back from public duties, he has continued to appear at family events and his absence from Sandringham suggests a further retreat from the public eye. The king has been under pressure to put more distance between Andrew and the royal family to avoid further embarrassment to the monarchy.",
      "While Andrew has said he never discussed anything sensitive with the suspected Chinese spy and that he ceased contact with the man as soon as concerns were raised, the scandal raises further questions about his judgment and distracts from the work of the royal family, said Ed Owens, author of \"After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?''",
      "\"The reason why this is a problem for the king is simply that the king is trying to rebrand the monarchy at the moment, centering its focus around him, but also around William, Catherine, what they are trying to do,\" Owens said.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult year for the monarchy, not least because of the two cancer diagnoses. And all the positive headlines that the king has been trying to generate of late, unfortunately, are overshadowed by the behavior, the reckless behavior, of his younger brother, who once again finds himself in the headlines.\"",

After a few months of dating, they had a son together, and they moved to Kansas. There was an opportunity to have a better life there, but it didn\u2019t last very long.

    "title": "'Home Alone' director finally answers what the McCallisters did for a living",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 16:38:14 -0500",
    "summary": "&quot;Home Alone&quot; director Chris Columbus shared on The Hollywood Reporter&apos;s &quot;Awards Chatter&quot; podcast how Macaulay Culkin was cast and what the 1990 film&apos;s characters did for work.",
    "story": [
      "Macaulay Culkin quoted one of his most famous lines from \u2018Home Alone\u2019 while receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "\"Home Alone\" is a holiday classic that has left viewers with many questions over the years.",
      "During a recent interview on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Awards Chatter\" podcast, the film's director, Chris Columbus, answered one of the internet's most burning questions: What did the McCallister parents do for a living?",
      "In the film, not only does the family live in a mansion in Chicago, but the parents, played by Catherine O'Hara and John Heard, are able to pay for a trip to Paris, for 15 people, including both their immediate and extended family members. Many fans of the film have been wondering, since the movie's 1990 release, how the couple were able to afford everything.",
      "\"Back then, John and I had a conversation about it, and we decided on what the jobs were,\" Columbus said. \"We thought the mother, at the time, because we used mannequins in the basement \u2014 I do remember having a conversation \u2014 she was a very successful fashion designer. The father could have, based on John Hughes' own experience, worked in advertising, but I don\u2019t remember what the father did.\"",

      "Columbus also dispelled the popular belief the dad worked in organized crime, explaining that \"even though there was, at the time, a lot of organized crime in Chicago,\" the father was definitely not involved.",
      "The movie focuses on a large family who leave for a vacation to Paris, only to realize they have left behind their youngest son, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin). Kevin must then reconcile with being left behind, while also defending his home from burglars, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.",
      "\"We thought the mother, at the time, because we used mannequins in the basement \u2014 I do remember having a conversation \u2014 she was a very successful fashion designer.\"",
      "While \"Home Alone\" went on to become the movie child star Culkin is most known for, Columbus shared he wasn't sold on casting him as the lead when he first signed on to the project. In the end, he conceded that Culkin \"was obviously the right kid,\" but that he had to get over \"the ego\" he had as a director to recognize it.",
      "\"This is why John Hughes was a great producer for a director, and I learned a lot from him,\" Columbus explained. \"He said, \u2018Will you take a look at meeting Macaulay?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d like to meet Macaulay, but I\u2019d like to meet everyone else, too.\u2019 I ended up meeting 300 other kids, too. Total colossal waste of time, because then I met Macaulay again, and it was magical.\"",

      "When it came to casting the other characters, Columbus said he knew the moment he saw Pesci and Stern onscreen together that they were the perfect duo. He also confirmed the rumor that legendary comedian Chris Farley was also up for a role in the movie.",
      "\"Farley was just starting out at the time,\" Columbus said about inviting Farley to an audition. \"This guy came in at 7 a.m. for our first reading for the guy who played Santa Claus in the movie. He was not in any particularly great shape. He had just come out from all night being in Chicago.\"",
      "Ultimately, Columbus said, \"We had to say, \u2018Well, not this time.\u2019\" He also shared that later in life, he and Farley became good friends and would often discuss his audition for the film.",
      "Chris Farley auditioned for a role in \"Home Alone.\" (Getty Images)",
      "In the interview, Columbus also shared how he came to direct the classic movie, explaining he was supposed to helm another Christmas classic, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,\" but his interactions with star Chevy Chase led him to pass on the opportunity.",
      "\"I\u2019m asking him all these questions, and he was just dead and not interested and distracted,\" Columbus said on the THR podcast. \"I thought, \u2018Wow, this is weird. For an actor who\u2019s committing to this movie, he really doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019\"",

      "He continued: \"Then, 40 minutes into the conversation, he says the most surreal thing I\u2019ve ever heard in a meeting, before or since. He said to me, \u2018Wait a second, you\u2019re the director?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I thought you were a drummer.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what the hell that meant.\"",
      "A second meeting with the actor didn't help persuade him, as Columbus shared that Chase ignored him throughout the dinner and \"was like I wasn\u2019t even involved in the film.\" \"Every time I brought up the film, he changed the subject,\" he explained.",
      "In the interview, Chris Columbus also shared how he came to direct the classic movie, explaining that he was supposed to helm another Christmas classic, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation.\" starring Chevy Chase. (Warner Bros.)",

      "1. Stay well-hydrated",

      "Water is always best, but other hydrating fluids include plain coffee or tea, sparkling or flavored waters, 100% vegetable juice, and milk or milk alternatives.",

      "4. Stay up-to-date on vaccines",
      "\"When you're about to take a trip, it is a good time for you to think about whether you\u2019re up-to-date on your vaccines,\" Siegel said.",
      "One immunization that isn\u2019t given enough attention, according to the doctor, is Tdap, a combination vaccine that protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough).",

      "5. Pack a travel health kit",

      "Hearth and Homestead founder Lily Wilmoth is pictured with her husband and five children. \"The biggest product for us has always been our tallow-based skincare products,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Hearth and Homestead)",

      "How is beef tallow made?",
      "Wilmoth revealed that her tallow balm is made from 100% grass-fed beef suet, or the fat that encases a cow's kidney, which is sourced from farms across the country.",
      "The fat is harvested, ground and rendered before it is melted down with herb-infused olive oil, and is then whipped, cooled and jarred, she said.",

      "\"It has a higher amount of nutrients than all the other fats in the animal,\" she went on. \"It's very creamy and white in texture. It doesn't have a weird smell or taste.\"",

      "In a Wednesday post on the platform Truth Social, Trump wished a \"Merry Christmas to all,\" including to the \"wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal,\" before moving on to take aim at Canada and Greenland as well, which he suggested again could be better off under U.S. governance.",
      "Trump reiterated his claim that U.S. shippers are being forced to pay \"ridiculous\" and \"exorbitant\" prices to navigate the Panama Canal\u2014an artificial, 51-mile waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

      "Congress spasmed between a staggering, 1,500-page spending bill. Then defeated a narrow, 116-page bill \u2013 which President-elect Trump endorsed. Things got worse when the House only commandeered a scant 174 yeas for the Trump-supported bill and 38 Republicans voted nay. Circumstances grew even more dire when the House actually voted to avert a holiday government shutdown \u2013 but passed the bill with more Democrats (196) than Republicans (170). Thirty-four GOPers voted nay.",
      "It was long likely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., might face a problem winning the speaker\u2019s gavel immediately when the new Congress convenes at noon ET on Jan. 3. Congressional experts knew that Johnson could be in trouble once the contours of the reed-thin House majority came into focus weeks after the November election.

      "Here\u2019s the math:",
      "The House clocks in at 434 members with one vacancy. That\u2019s thanks to former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. He resigned his position for this Congress a few weeks ago. Even though Gaetz won re-election in November, his resignation letter \u2013 read on the floor of the House \u2013 signaled he did not plan to serve in the new Congress, which begins in January.",
      "This is the breakdown when the Congress starts: 219 Republicans to 215 Democrats.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., remains in the House for now. So does Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Trump tapped her to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. That\u2019s pending Senate confirmation \u2013 perhaps in late January or early February. Once Waltz and Stefanik resign, the GOP majority dwindles to 217-214.",
      "But the speaker\u2019s election on Jan. 3 poses a special challenge. Here\u2019s the bar for Johnson \u2013 or anyone else: The speaker of the House must win an outright majority of all members casting ballots for someone by name. In other words, the person with the most votes does not win. That\u2019s what happened repeatedly to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., when he routinely outpolled House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for speaker to begin this Congress in January 2023. But it took days for McCarthy to cross the proper threshold.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson emerges bruised from the recent government funding donnybrook. (Getty)",
      "More on that in a moment.",
      "So let\u2019s crunch the math for Mike Johnson. If there are 219 Republicans and four voted for someone besides him \u2013 and all Democrats cast ballots for Jeffries, the tally is 215-214. But there\u2019s no speaker. No one attained an outright majority of all members casting ballots for someone by name. The magic number is 218 if all 434 members vote.",
      "By rule, this paralyzes the House. The House absolutely, unequivocally, cannot do anything until it elects a speaker. Period.",

It burned through two speaker candidates off the floor \u2013 House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn. \u2013 and one candidate on the floor: Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "So you see the problem.",
      "Consider for a moment that prior to last year, the House never went to a second ballot to select a speaker since Speaker Frederick Gillett, R-Mass., in 1923.",
      "It took 63 ballots before the House finally settled on Speaker Howell Cobb, D-Ga., in 1849.",

The election is not final until the joint session concludes and the vice president \u2013 in this case Kamala Harris \u2013 in her capacity as president of the Senate, announces a victor.",
      "Congress is not required to certify the Electoral College on the calendar day of Jan. 6. There is actually some leeway to wrap things up. In 2021, the Electoral College wasn\u2019t certified until around 3:52 a.m. on Jan. 7. It only becomes a major problem if this drags on through noon on Jan. 20. That\u2019s when the Constitution prescribes that the president-elect take the oath of office.",
      "What happens if the Electoral College isn\u2019t sorted out by Jan. 20? Well, President Biden is done. So he\u2019s gone. The same with Harris. Next in the presidential line of succession is the speaker of the House. Well, there\u2019s no speaker. So who becomes president?",
      "On Jan. 6, the House and Senate are supposed to meet in a joint session of Congress to tabulate and certify the electoral votes. (Getty Images)",

At this moment, the president pro tempore is Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. But Republicans claim control of the chamber in early January. And unlike the House, if it\u2019s stymied over a speaker, the Senate is functioning. That means 91-year-old Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, becomes Senate president pro tempore.

According to a July 2024 warning from the\u00a0FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, these scams are part of the cartel's efforts to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including drug trafficking.",
      "Since at least 2012, the cartel and other Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations have increasingly targeted U.S. owners of timeshare properties in Mexico, particularly older adults who are often more vulnerable to such scams. The proceeds from these fraudulent activities not only support the cartel's operations but also contribute to the manufacturing and trafficking of dangerous substances like fentanyl into the United States.",

      "How these scams work",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has expanded its criminal activities beyond traditional drug trafficking into sophisticated scams, including timeshare fraud targeting unsuspecting individuals, particularly Americans. Here are some of the methods employed by the cartel in executing these scams:",
      "Impersonation of legitimate entities: Scammers often pose as legitimate real estate agents, escrow companies or even officials from U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department. This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",
      "Targeting vulnerable populations: The cartel primarily targets elderly Americans who own timeshares in Mexico. These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "To avoid falling victim to similar scams, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard your financial interests:",
      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Remember, knowledge is power. By staying informed and skeptical, you're already one step ahead of these fraudsters. Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. And don't be afraid to ask for help or report suspicious activity. Let's make life a whole lot harder for these scammers and keep your hard-earned money where it belongs: in your pocket.",

      "These days, it\u2019s not just your laptop and phone connected to the network, but also things like security cameras, thermostats and even air conditioners are all managed by your router. But be honest, when was the last time you did anything to secure your router? It\u2019s easy to forget about it, especially if it\u2019s working fine.

      "Shocking router security facts you need to know",
      "The\u00a02024 Broadband Genie router security survey has uncovered some startling facts about how internet users approach router security. Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "Alarmingly, 75% of users have never checked to see who is connected to their network. With an average home now hosting around 12 connected devices, failing to monitor network activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Even more worrying, three-quarters of respondents do not understand why adjusting router settings is important, showing a significant gap in awareness about the risks associated with default configurations.",
      "\"In 2022, we ran a similar study and found 48% had never touched their router's factory settings. It\u2019s concerning that not only has the number come down after two years, it\u2019s got worse,\" said Alex Tofts, strategist at Broadband Genie.",
      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",

      "Data breaches are becoming an alarming trend, and health care incidents stand out for their potentially lifelong consequences. I just reported how a data breach at a physician-led\u00a0vein center exposed almost half a million people\u2019s data to hackers. And now, another health care data breach has come to light and this one affects even more people. The data breach exposes sensitive personal and medical information belonging to over 910,000 patients through ConnectOnCall, a telehealth platform and after-hours call service owned by Phreesia.",

      "Health care software provider Phreesia has revealed that its ConnectOnCall service was hit by a data breach that lasted from Feb. 16 to May 12, 2024. During this time, an unknown hacker gained access to the platform and pulled data from provider-patient communications. ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",
      "Phreesia, which bought ConnectOnCall in October 2023, discovered the breach on May 12 and says it jumped into action right away. The company brought in external cybersecurity pros to lock down the platform and reported the breach to federal law enforcement.",
      "\"On May 12, 2024, ConnectOnCall learned of an issue impacting ConnectOnCall and immediately began an investigation and took steps to secure the product and ensure the overall security of its environment,\" the company\u00a0revealed in a press release.",
      "According to a report filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the breach impacted 914,138 patients (via\u00a0Bleeping Computer). The stolen data includes names, phone numbers, medical record numbers, dates of birth and details about health conditions, treatments or prescriptions. In a few cases, Social Security numbers were also compromised.",
      "Phreesia claims its other services, like the patient intake platform, were not affected. The company has since taken ConnectOnCall offline and is working on bringing it back in a more secure setup.",

      "The risks associated with the ConnectOnCall data breach",
      "The impact of this breach is significant due to the sensitive nature of health care data. Unlike financial breaches, where compromised accounts can be frozen or replaced, health information is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals may exploit this data to commit\u00a0identity theft, including obtaining prescription drugs fraudulently or filing false insurance claims.",
      "Plus, the detailed health information exposed \u2013 such as diagnoses, treatments and medications \u2013 can be used for targeted\u00a0phishing attacks. Scammers could exploit victims\u2019 medical histories to create highly convincing schemes, increasing the likelihood of success.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2) Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",

      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ConnectOnCall health data breach highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures within the health care sector, where the stakes are often much higher than in other industries. With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud.

      "Unless you go completely off the grid digitally \u2014 no internet, online accounts or smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid leaving a digital footprint.

Neglecting basic security like two-factor authentication, reusing passwords or shopping on untrustworthy websites can leave you exposed. Using finance apps that share your data, like allowing data brokers to profit off your personal information, also increases your risks of experiencing fraud and identity theft. By staying vigilant, you can protect both your finances and your loved ones.",

      "South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country\u2019s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment.",
      "Han\u2019s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country\u2019s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han\u2019s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote.

Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president\u2019s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",

      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment. That\u2019s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Yoon\u2019s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn\u2019t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning,",
      "His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon\u2019s decree.",

The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered.",
      "Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels.",

      "Saar Zohar, a reservist in an elite unit, expressed a similar shift. For years, Zohar resisted owning a gun, believing it unnecessary after his service. But a series of terror attacks following Oct. 7 pushed him to reconsider. \"I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being helpless if something happened,\" he says. \"Knowing I have the training and can respond, I feel it is my responsibility.\"",

      "Unlike in the United States, where gun ownership is often linked to fears of crime or the defense of private property, firearms in Israel are seen as tools for countering terrorism. Historically, Israel has avoided the public mass shootings that have sometimes plagued the U.S., but experts warn that the rapid proliferation of firearms could change this. With so many untrained individuals carrying weapons, the fear of impulsive actions and tragic mistakes looms large.",

      "For many Israelis, the reform represents a necessary response to an existential threat. Yet, it has also exposed deep flaws in the system.

      "Froman sees things differently. \"If someone threatens you, you only draw your weapon in a national security situation. You don\u2019t pull a gun for personal life-threatening situations unless it\u2019s a case of terrorists. The rules here are clear \u2013 you must have a safe for your weapon.

Brooks Spector told Fox News Digital.",
      "Spector, a former U.S. diplomat now based in Johannesburg, and associate editor of the respected Daily Maverick, added that \"continuing action and rhetoric by South Africa in its pursuit of Israel in international court efforts will, however, encourage Republicans in Congress (and probably in the administration as well) to strip South Africa of benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, assuming the act is renewed next year.\"",

      "South Africa\u2019s moves are very definitely in an extremely bright spotlight in Washington. From inside the beltway, Richard Goldberg told Fox News Digital he\u2019s worried particularly over potential links between South Africa and Iran. Goldberg is a former member of the National Security Council, and a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He told Fox News Digital, \"The first step is to build the case publicly, and give South Africa one last moment of choosing. We should declassify intelligence about South Africa\u2019s deep relationship with Iran, and any other support or partnership with terrorist groups.\"",
      "Goldberg continued, \"And then we need to use our full diplomatic and economic weight to force Pretoria to choose between the United States and our terrorist adversaries. AGOA should be one of several items on the policy menu.\"",
      "South Africa\u2019s Department of International Relations didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment, but COSATU\u2019s Parliamentary Coordinator, Matthew Parks, did. COSATU is the Confederation of South African Trade Unions, historically aligned with President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC party. Parks is highly respected for his meaningful and dignified pursuance of workers\u2019 rights. His members have much to lose, including potentially their jobs, if South Africa is pushed out of AGOA. But he appeared to be cautiously optimistic when talking to Fox News Digital. \"We are confident that our relations with the U.S. will continue to grow, including through AGOA, simply because it is to the benefit of both our peoples,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and former President Trump appear during a Fox News Channel town hall in Greenville, South Carolina, on Feb. 20. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)",
      "\"We\u2019ve been extensively involved in engagements between South Africa and the U.S., on how to deepen our relations and toward the renewal of AGOA,\" Parks continued. \"We\u2019ve engaged extensively with our colleagues in the U.S. labor movement, business community, Congress (both Republicans and Democrats), the State Department, Department of Labor, NSC and the White House.\"",
      "As Trump moves into the White House, nearby Ebrahim Rassool will be starting his second term as South African ambassador to the U.S. This month he talked to the Daily Maverick\u00a0on South Africa\u2019s challenges with the new administration, referring to South Africa\u2019s attack on Israel at the ICJ.\u00a0\"We will stick by the case, but let us now trust our legal team,\" he said, \"trust the evidence that we have placed in front of the judges of the ICJ, trust the judges of the ICJ to come to a sustainable, just solution \u2014 but that we need to put away the megaphone now.\"",

      "Rassool pointed out that the South African oranges exported to the U.S. under AGOA enabled Americans to drink orange juice all year round, when Florida and California oranges were out of season.",
      "Rassool added, \"Why would you want to punish America with expensive cars when the BMWs coming from South Africa are going to be much cheaper than getting them from Germany or manufacturing your own?",
      "\"Likewise, to point out that American cancer patients are receiving medical nuclear isotopes that come from South Africa.\"",
      "The expulsion of South Africa from AGOA would be \"disastrous,\" Renai Moothilal, CEO of the National Association of Automotive Component & Allied Manufacturers, wrote last year in the Business Day newspaper. \"It will be no surprise if some component manufacturers close their doors. U.S.-headquartered multinational manufacturers with plants here may exit the South African country if there are volume losses linked to our exclusion from AGOA, or other forms of political pressure are brought to bear.\"",
      "Observers note there are loud threats coming from President-elect Trump himself, including a claim that he will slap a 100% import tariff on countries like South Africa if, as members of BRICS, they adopt a new currency to rival the dollar. In the other corner of the ring, South African politicians are taking a more placatory and reserved tone. The Democratic Alliance or DA is South Africa\u2019s main opposition party. But since May, they have also been members of the government of national unity, working in a sometimes noisy coalition with President Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC.",

      "Emma Powell, the DA\u2019s national spokesperson for foreign affairs, told Fox News Digital that it\u2019s likely the relationship between Pretoria and Washington \"will become increasingly transactional, with greater emphasis placed on equitable reciprocity. This would contrast the Biden administration\u2019s approach to beneficiation-based investment and development. There is also likely to be less tolerance for any action on the part of the South African government that may be perceived as undermining the national security interests of the United States.\"",
      "Powell added that \"the Trump administration is also likely to take a more cautious approach on AGOA eligibility.\"",
      "Spector told Fox News Digital he could take home one strong positive: \"The incoming U.S. president\u2019s often-expressed support for transactional foreign economic policies may possibly be an incentive for Africa's nations \u2014 urged on by South Africa \u2013 to come together with initiatives offering trade and market concessions in Africa to America.\"",

      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that we were talking about millennials as kids,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, a generational researcher and the author of \u201cZconomy: How Gen Z Will Change the Future of Business \u2014 and What to Do About It.\u201d",
      "Dorsey says Generation Beta will be starting their lives much differently than their Gen Alpha counterparts. The children of younger millennials and older Gen Zers, they will be born into a completely post-pandemic world. Many of them will live to see the 22nd century.",
      "Much like the youngest of Gen Alpha, they may not experience the school shutdowns and social isolation of Covid, but their families and their siblings will have been irrevocably shaped by it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be something that maybe older siblings went through, certainly something they learn about in history, but not something that is necessarily a contemporary event,\u201d he said.",
      "Generation Beta will probably be entrenched in smart devices and artificial intelligence in a way that previous generations haven\u2019t been, according to Dorsey. Like Gen Alpha, they will rely on them to solve problems.",
      "They will also likely grow up with climate change as a dire reality with more direct consequences on their lives. As they mature, they will see Gen X and boomer leaders dealing with these problems slowly replaced by millennials and Gen Z.",
      "\u201cWe will likely have Gen Z as elected officials when Gen Beta is old enough to vote,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cClimate change will continue to be a really big deal for them.\u201d",
      "Gen Alpha\u2019s chronically online reputation",
      "Just like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, Gen Beta will grow up with social media, though it\u2019s still unknown how those mediums will evolve in the next decade-plus. But other experts predict that Gen Z parents might choose to shield their kids from being chronically online, a stereotype that has come to define Gen Alpha.",
      "While older millennial parents tend to integrate technology into their Gen Alpha kids\u2019 lives, McCrindle wrote that Gen Z parents might take a different approach with their future Gen Beta children.",
      "\u201cGeneration Z know more about both the positives and challenges that come with social media use from a young age,\u201d McCrindle wrote. \u201cAs the most technologically savvy generation of parents, Gen Z see the benefits of technology and screen time, but equally they see the downsides of it and are pushing back on technology and the age at which their children access and engage with it.\u201d",
      "In the last couple of years, Gen Alpha has developed a reputation of being \u201ciPad kids,\u201d consuming nonsensical content on social media and popularizing a lexicon of confusing phrases like \u201cskibidi toilet\u201d and \u201cwhat the sigma.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to create this in-group which alienates older people,\u201d content creator and linguist Adam Aleksic told NBC News in August. \u201cAnd it can be hard for older people to catch up, because you\u2019ve got to be very current with the fads. It evolves so quickly online.\u201d",
      "Are generational labels useful?",
      "With how fast the world seems to be evolving, categorizing a 15-year age range under one label is becoming a challenge, Dorsey said.",
      "He sees the value in generational names when it comes to identifying a group of people all affected by a standout moment in time, Dorsey said. For millennials, that defining event was 9/11, he said, and for Gen Z, the pandemic. It\u2019s too early to predict what those will be for Gen Alpha and Gen Beta, he said.",
      "\u201cThese are clues to help us get context for what a group of people likely or may have experienced as they came of age,\u201d he said.",
      "But there are drawbacks to generational labels, some researchers have noted.",
      "The Pew Research Center said in 2023 that it would mostly stop using generational labels in its research, writing in part that demographic differences like race and class are bigger factors in dictating a group\u2019s commonalities.",
      "\u201cBy choosing not to use the standard generational labels when they\u2019re not appropriate, we can avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or oversimplifying people\u2019s complex lived experiences,\u201d Pew researchers wrote.",
      "Dorsey agrees, saying that we can look back at millennials and boomers, or look forward to Gen Alpha and Gen Beta, for overarching trends. But maintaining perspective is important.",
      "\u201cGenerational labels are helpful as long as you understand their limitations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think they\u2019re really helpful to get a head start, to create more of a shared understanding. \u2026 We\u2019re all still individuals.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for a New Jersey man charged with the brutal murders of four of his relatives are challenging the use of an increasingly common tool that has transformed DNA analysis in dozens of labs across the United States, saying the technique hasn\u2019t been properly vetted for use in criminal courts.",
      "A weekslong pretrial hearing about STRmix, which allows forensic analysts to test DNA samples that most likely would have been considered unusable a decade ago because they were too complex or small, ended this month in a Monmouth County courtroom in the case of Paul Caneiro, who has denied killing his family in 2018.",
      "While Caneiro\u2019s defense lawyers and experts have argued that the software hasn\u2019t been proved reliable in the same way \u201csafety-critical\u201d systems used in cars and airplanes are \u2014 and that it could produce false results that could help wrongfully convict someone \u2014 prosecutors have argued that STRmix has been tested and tried in labs and courts across the country.",
      "The \u201cmotivation is to actually test the software well, try and break it if we can, and, if we miss something, just honestly report what has happened,\u201d one of STRmix\u2019s developers, John Buckleton, testified last month, according to a transcript.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to contribute to an injustice ever,\u201d he added.",
      "A judge is expected to weigh in on the matter in February. Regardless of the outcome, said Marc Canellas, a public defender in Maryland who specializes in forensics and has handled cases that involve STRmix, the case highlights the long-standing need for stricter rules in an industry that can have accreditation standards but isn\u2019t overseen by a regulatory authority.",
      "\u201cEven if this judge says that STRmix is completely unreliable, another judge in the same courthouse the next day could say that it is reliable,\u201d he said.",
      "Brutal deaths and then two house fires",
      "Caneiro, who was 51 at the time of the killings, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and other crimes in the deaths of his brother, Keith Caneiro, 50; Keith\u2019s wife, Jennifer Caneiro, 45; and their two children, Jesse, 11, and Sophia, 8.",
      "The New Jersey family was found dead at its home on Nov. 20, 2018, in Colts Neck, 47 miles south of New York City. Prosecutors have alleged that Caneiro fatally shot his brother, stabbed his niece and nephew and shot and stabbed his sister-in-law before he set their home on fire.",
      "He then set his own house ablaze to destroy evidence and make it appear as if the entire family had been targeted, authorities have alleged.",
      "Caneiro has pleaded not guilty. His previous defense team said there was \u201cabsolutely no reason in the world for Paul Caneiro to have committed the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He would never hurt any member of his family.\u201d",
      "Jury selection is expected to start in March.",
      "Among the evidence cited by prosecutors were more than a dozen DNA samples that analysts processed using STRmix. STRmix\u2019s technology promises to help solve what has long been an issue in DNA analysis: The tinier the sample and the more complex it is \u2014 if it contained genetic material from multiple people, for instance \u2014 the more difficult it has been to properly analyze, said William Thompson, a professor emeritus of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied DNA for decades.",
      "Probabilistic genotyping",
      "Traditional DNA analysis was largely limited to samples that contained genetic material from a couple of people, said Monica Ghannam, a forensic scientist who testified in the Caneiro hearing, according to a local newspaper, the Asbury Park Press.",
      "Using STRmix, she testified, analysts can evaluate mixtures with DNA from four people, the newspaper reported.",
      "Developed by scientists in New Zealand and Australia, the technology is one of a handful of forensic tools that use \u201cprobabilistic genotyping\u201d to try to remedy that problem, said Jack Ballantyne, a professor of chemistry at the University of Central Florida and associate director of research at the National Center for Forensic Science.",
      "The software uses statistical modeling to analyze complex mixtures of genetic material that may have been obtained from something as small as a few human cells left on a doorknob, Thompson said.",
      "The makers of the technology say that STRmix can \u201cde-convolute\u201d such mixtures to identify the genetic profiles of the people who may have left those cells behind, Thompson said, and that the software can estimate how much more likely it would be to find those profiles on the doorknob if the DNA came from a person of interest and not a random person.",
      "STRmix is the most widely used software in the United States that claims to do that, Ballantyne said.",
      "\u201cIt has revolutionized the ability to analyze complex mixtures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the U.S. is moving the DNA community lock, stock and barrel into the probabilistic genotyping arena.\u201d",
      "Whether public or private, he added, the majority of labs in the United States that do forensic casework involving DNA most likely use the method.",
      "New technology, new results",
      "One set of results obtained by the New Jersey State Police DNA lab illustrates the possibility of the technology. A pair of jeans found in Paul Caneiro\u2019s basement had a bloodstain on the shin area, and when analysts examined it in 2018 using traditional DNA methods, they found that it contained genetic material from two people, said Christine Schlenker, a forensic scientist in the lab, a transcript of her testimony shows.",
      "But the quality of the DNA wasn\u2019t good enough to yield a result, Schlenker said. After the lab obtained the software, an analysis using STRmix showed that the blood in the stain appeared to mostly be that of Paul Caneiro\u2019s nephew, Jesse, Schlenker said. The DNA was 2.7 septillion times more likely to have come from Jesse than someone else, she said.",
      "Monmouth County prosecutors wouldn\u2019t comment on STRmix or its uses in the Caneiro case. At the pretrial hearing, prosecutor Nicole Wallace said STRmix has been tested repeatedly and is generally accepted in the scientific community that tracks and evaluates such technology, according to a transcript. And in a brief filed this year, prosecutors said there have been court hearings across the United States evaluating what defense lawyers have argued is \u201cnovel\u201d software.",
      "\u201cThe results have been consistent,\u201d the brief says. \u201cSTRmix is not new \u2014 it is tried and tested.\u201d",
      "But Caneiro\u2019s lawyers and software engineers who testified for the defense said that testing hasn\u2019t been carried out adequately or independently. Such testing has been key to preventing catastrophic software failures in aviation systems and nuclear weapons, said Canellas, the Maryland public defender, as well as on devices with far less serious stakes.",
      "\u201cWe do this type of testing for mobile games and mobile apps, and yet we aren\u2019t doing it for the criminal legal system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, to me, is just appalling.\u201d",
      "The world\u2019s largest engineering organization, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, has previously called on developers of digital forensics tools \u2014 including probabilistic genotyping software \u2014 to follow its strictest standard for independent verification and validation to avoid \u201cfalse imprisonment and the deprivation of people\u2019s rights,\u201d the group said in a statement three years ago.",
      "That standard, which has been used on nuclear weapons and space exploration probes, requires independent testing at three levels \u2014 technical, financial and managerial \u2014 and it aims to assess everything from a product\u2019s fundamental concept to accurate coding and the likelihood of false results, the statement said.",
      "In his closing argument, Caneiro's lawyer, Christopher Godin of the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, said the people behind STRmix are \u201cintimately\u201d involved in helping DNA labs set up and test it.",
      "Buckleton, the STRmix developer, testified that the people who work on the software assist labs in their validations they assist labs in their validations and offered an analogy: \u201cIf you had a new Pratt & Whitney jet engine for your Boeing aircraft, would you like to be handed the manual and say go for it?\u201d",
      "Buckleton, who is principal scientist at the New Zealand Institute of Environmental Science and Research, described the standard from the IEEE, as the engineering organization is known, as \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cdesirable\u201d and said STRmix conforms with it.",
      "But Canellas, who has a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering and is a member of IEEE, said he has seen not publicly released details corroborating Buckleton\u2019s statement. (A manager for STRmix said it wouldn\u2019t comment on the matter.)",
      "\u2018Too much ambiguity\u2019",
      "Caneiro\u2019s lawyers also pointed to several DNA analyses in the case that appeared to violate the labs\u2019 internal validation studies, or testing that labs do before they start using the software to establish what samples they can reliably analyze.",
      "The samples relied on less DNA than what had been examined in those studies, according to the defense brief, and the labs didn\u2019t test for a key part of the samples in the Caneiro case \u2014 \u201crelatedness.\u201d",
      "Relatives share genetic markers, the brief says, and interpreting their DNA can be far more challenging. The Caneiro case involves five family members: four victims and one alleged perpetrator.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s too much ambiguity,\u201d Godin said in his closing argument.",
      "Wallace, the prosecutor, countered that the analysts who examined the Caneiro samples had no difficulty assessing the relatives\u2019 DNA and that neither did experts who reviewed them later for the prosecution. Wallace acknowledged that one of the labs analyzed samples that were below what they\u2019d examined in their validation studies, but she pointed to a recent appellate ruling that described that not as a fundamental flaw in the forensics, but as an issue for juries to grapple with.",
      "Thompson, of UC Irvine, said that from what he has seen, STRmix works well if it\u2019s used under the conditions it has been tested for. But, he said, labs can run into trouble when they analyze complex types of samples that haven\u2019t been validated, especially if they\u2019re relying on tiny amounts of DNA.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been following the development of DNA technology for over 30 years now,\u201d said Thompson, who wasn\u2019t familiar with the Caneiro case. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of people getting enamored of the technology and taking it a little bit too far and not quite understanding what they\u2019re doing. And I think that could definitely happen with regard to probabilistic genotyping. Probably it already has happened.\""

    "story": [
      "Eleven Illinois teenagers were charged with felony crimes after two men using dating apps were allegedly lured and beaten during the summer, according to police.",
      "Some of the teens, males 17 and 16, took inspiration for the alleged crimes from a viral social media trend, the Mount Prospect Police Department said in a statement Thursday. Police did not elaborate on what the social media trend entailed.",
      "Around 9:45 p.m. on July 8, a 41-year-old man reported to police that he'd been beaten by \"a group of teenagers\" in a parking lot on West Northwest Highway in Mount Prospect, Illinois.",
      "\"The victim related that he had utilized an online dating app to arrange to meet a person at that location,\" police said. \"After arriving, the victim related that he was approached by a group of teenage males, who confronted him verbally and battered him. Teenagers in the group also damaged the victim\u2019s vehicle.\"",
      "The 41-year-old was followed by the teenagers when he tried to flee in his car, but was able to get away from them, police said.",
      "About 10 minutes later, police responded to a report of a battery. A 23-year-old man told police he arranged to meet someone through a dating app about a mile away from the location of the first incident  and was instead approached by teen males who beat him, with one slashing tires on his car.",
      "Police did not provide the name of the dating app and did not say if it was one or more apps used to lure the men.",
      "The 23-year-old man was able to get in his car and drive away but had to stop after realizing some of his tires were slashed. He asked the residents of a nearby home to call 911, police said.",
      "\"The Mount Prospect Police Detectives were able  to locate video surveillance footage that captured the incident at 606 West Northwest Highway and were able to identify some of the offenders in the video,\" police said. \"An extensive investigation was conducted where 11 total juveniles were identified as taking part in one or both incidents.\"",
      "The teens were charged with one or two counts each of aggravated battery, criminal damage to property and mob action. Detectives also said one used \"a racial and another derogatory term\" during one of the alleged incidents, resulting in two hate crime charges for that teen, according to police.",
      "Police did not mention which slurs the teenager allegedly used. None of the teens were identified because they are minors, police confirmed.",
      "The Mount Prospect Police Department said the Cook County State's Attorney's Office approved the charges for the teens, who all turned themselves in last month and were taken to Chicago's Cook County Juvenile Detention Center.",
      "The Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The police department is advising parents to speak to their children about partaking in social media trends.",
      "\"We are asking parents to take these incidents as an opportunity to talk with their teenage children about the seriousness of actively participating in these types of trends they see on social media,\" Police Chief Michael Eterno said."

    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "The revelation that a Texas medical school was routinely dissecting the bodies of unclaimed people and leasing them out to for-profit medical device companies for training and research drew a rapid and far-reaching response.",
      "NBC News\u2019 investigation into the University of North Texas Health Science Center led to changes even before the first article ran, with the center announcing in response to the reporters\u2019 findings that it was suspending its body donation program and firing the officials who led it. Medical technology companies that had received unclaimed bodies from the center also pre-emptively said they were changing policies or re-evaluating their work with the program.",
      "When the first part of the investigation was published online and aired on NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News with Lester Holt,\u201d elected officials at the local, state and federal level expressed alarm at what had occurred and said they would push for policy changes to prevent it from ever happening again.",
      "After obtaining the names of hundreds of people whose unclaimed bodies were sent to the Health Science Center, reporters discovered that some families had been unaware their relatives\u2019 bodies had been donated. To help survivors find answers, NBC News later published the names of the unclaimed dead, leading several more families to come forward, aghast at what they learned but grateful to finally know the truth.",
      "\u201cHow does something like that happen?\u201d Tim Leggett said after spotting the name of his brother, Denzil \"Dale\" Leggett, on the list. \u201cHow could somebody not realize, \u2018Hey, this person\u2019s probably got family here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Here is more detail on the impact of NBC News\u2019 \u201cDealing the Dead\u201d series, which includes changes meant to ensure the bodies of the unclaimed dead are treated with respect and dignity in North Texas and beyond.",
      "1. UNT\u2019s Health Science Center fired officials and stopped accepting unclaimed bodies",
      "The University of North Texas Health Science Center initially defended its use of unclaimed bodies, but after NBC News presented its detailed findings, the center announced that it was suspending its body donation program, firing the officials who led it and hiring a consulting firm to investigate.",
      "\u201cAs a result of the information brought to light through your inquiries, it has become clear that failures existed in the management and oversight of The University of North Texas Health Science Center\u2019s Willed Body Program,\u201d the center said in a statement.",
      "Days later, the Health Science Center said it would stop accepting unclaimed bodies, explaining that its decision was based on information uncovered through reporters\u2019 requests. These documents detailed \u201cdeficiencies in leadership, standards of respect and care, and professionalism exhibited,\u201d the center\u2019s president, Sylvia Trent-Adams, wrote in an email to students, faculty and staff.",
      "University of North Texas spokesperson Andy North also apologized to families in a statement to NBC News: \u201cThe Willed Body and BioSkills programs fell short of the standards of respect, care and professionalism that we demand. We are working to connect with families to extend our deepest apologies.\u201d",
      "2. Medical technology companies changed policies and cut ties with the Health Science Center",
      "Companies, teaching hospitals and medical schools that relied on the Health Science Center also took action. DePuy Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson company, said it had paused its relationship with the center. Boston Scientific said that it was no longer working with the center and that it had updated its global policy \u201cto require consent by the individual or next-of-kin.\u201d",
      "Dr. Douglas Hampers, National Bioskills Laboratories\u2019 CEO, said his company would ensure that it no longer accepted unclaimed bodies. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to violate a family\u2019s rights in order to train physicians,\u201d he said.",
      "In all, 10 organizations and companies said they did not know the center had provided them with unclaimed bodies.",
      "3. The Army said it would clarify its policies on unclaimed bodies",
      "The Army, which had received dozens of bodies and body parts from the Health Science Center, said it, too, was examining its reliance on the center\u2019s Willed Body Program. The Army also said it planned to review and clarify internal policies on the use of unclaimed bodies.",
      "Separately, Terrence Hayes, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, offered condolences to the family of Victor Honey, a homeless veteran whose body was cut up and leased out to medical device companies and the Army without his consent or his relatives\u2019 knowledge.",
      "\u201cWe were extremely saddened to hear of his and his family\u2019s story,\u201d Hayes said in a statement. \u201cMr. Honey, like all Veterans who have served our nation with courage and honor, deserved a dignified burial at the time of his passing.\u201d",
      "4. Tarrant County made changes to treat the unclaimed dead with dignity",
      "Hundreds of unclaimed bodies flowed to the University of North Texas from Tarrant and Dallas counties, which saw the arrangement as a cost savings. The contracts the counties signed to turn over their unclaimed dead to the Health Science Center drew little scrutiny prior to NBC News\u2019 reporting.",
      "When reporters shared their findings \u2014\u00a0including the stories of heartbroken family members \u2014 with the top elected official in Tarrant County, Judge Tim O\u2019Hare, he responded by saying that he planned to explore legal options \u201cto end any and all immoral, unethical, and irresponsible practices stemming from this program.\u201d He called NBC News\u2019 reporting \u201cdisturbing, to say the least.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Hare followed up by leading the Tarrant County Commissioners Court in unanimously voting to adopt a new policy requiring officials to make more strenuous efforts to contact the deceased\u2019s next of kin and to take their religious beliefs into account when deciding whether to bury or cremate them.",
      "In addition, Tarrant County began publishing the names of unclaimed people on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, a free public database meant to connect reports of missing people to unclaimed bodies.",
      "Dallas County leaders said they also planned to review policies for handling unclaimed bodies.",
      "5. A Texas lawmaker announced a bill to ban medical research on unclaimed bodies",
      "State Sen. Tan Parker, a Republican, announced plans to introduce a bill in the next legislative session in January to prohibit the use of people\u2019s bodies for research unless they or their survivors give full consent.",
      "He said he had no idea before seeing NBC News\u2019 investigation that the Health Science Center had made money off of unclaimed bodies by dissecting them and leasing out the body parts.",
      "\u201cI was outraged and completely just disgusted to see what had been occurring,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHuman life is sacred and needs to always be protected, and that is a core principle to me.\u201d",
      "6. Texas authorities ordered the Health Science Center to stop liquefying bodies",
      "The Texas Funeral Service Commission, which regulates body donation programs in the state, said it was conducting a review as well.",
      "The commission inspected the Health Science Center in October, after NBC News began publishing its investigation, and sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the center to stop its practice of liquefying bodies after using them for training and research. The center had turned to alkaline hydrolysis, also known as water cremation, to save money, which the Funeral Commission said was illegal.",
      "\u201cThis practice is not authorized under Texas state law and constitutes a serious violation of the standards governing the lawful disposition of human remains,\u201d the commission said in the letter to Trent-Adams, the Health Science Center\u2019s president.",
      "The center defended the legality of the practice in a statement to NBC News but said it had halted water cremations in September \u2014 on the same day NBC News\u2019 investigation was published.",
      "7. Members of Congress pressed local officials for information",
      "U.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett and Marc Veasey requested answers from officials in Dallas and Tarrant counties, saying they were \u201cshocked\u201d by NBC News\u2019 investigation, including reporters\u2019 finding that the unclaimed bodies included veterans who are entitled to federal benefits that cover military funerals.",
      "In a letter to Dallas and Tarrant counties, they expressed particular concern that Victor Honey\u2019s body had been used without anyone notifying his family that he was dead.",
      "\u201cBy failing to contact Mr. Honey\u2019s family, he was deprived of the rights he earned by bravely serving our country,\u201d Crockett and Veasey wrote. \u201cThis case alone raises serious concerns regarding how Dallas and Tarrant County investigators attempt to satisfy the \u2018diligent inquiry\u2019 requirement set forth by state law.\u201d",
      "8. Families found long-sought answers about their relatives",
      "NBC News\u2019 reporting had a significant impact on families who hadn\u2019t known what happened to their loved ones. As of December, reporters have identified at least 25 people whose bodies were sent to the Health Science Center without their relatives\u2019 knowledge; 11 of those people\u2019s families learned details of what happened from NBC News.",
      "As a public service, NBC News published a list of more than 1,800 people whose bodies were sent to the Health Science Center, to help readers who are searching for answers about their loved ones. Noticias Telemundo, which is part of NBCUniversal, published a Spanish-language version of the list. Reporters heard from six readers who learned of their family members\u2019 death or donation when they discovered their names on the list.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was dead or what happened to her,\u201d said Abigail Willson, whose mother, Nika Michelle Hodges, died at a Fort Worth hospice last year and whose body was then donated without her consent to the Health Science Center. \u201cWe have searched everywhere, all over Texas. If you wouldn\u2019t have put out that list of names, we never would have known.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For decades, South Korea was an example of a vibrant democracy and economy. On Friday, the key United States ally was in uncharted territory when legislators voted to impeach the acting president less than two weeks after ousting the country\u2019s previous leader.",
      "The ruling People\u2019s Power Party surrounded the speaker\u2019s podium following the vote to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo, chanting that the vote was invalid and accusing parliament of committing \u201ctyranny.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 14, President Yoon Suk Yeol was himself impeached after attempting to declare martial law. Opinion polls conducted after Yoon\u2019s bid to impose military rule showed overwhelming public support for his removal.",
      "Choi Sang-mok, the former deputy prime minister and minister of economy and finance, replaced Han, becoming South Korea\u2019s second acting president in two weeks.Following the impeachment, Choi said that the government had ordered the military to increase vigilance, citing the possibility that North Korea could exploit South Korea\u2019s political instability to carry out acts of provocation.",
      "\u201cAs a member of the Cabinet, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the current situation and extend my heartfelt apologies to the people,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 19:11:57 GMT",
    "summary": "What is the bird flu pandemic risk? CDC analysis suggests the H5N1 virus has the capacity to mutate in ways that could make it more transmissible to humans.",
    "story": [
      "H5N1 bird flu samples collected from a severely ill patient in Louisiana show signs of mutations that may make the virus more transmissible to humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.",
      "The unidentified patient, who was hospitalized with serious respiratory symptoms, is believed to have contracted bird flu from exposure to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The patient has not been identified but is reportedly over 65 with underlying health problems and is the second person in the United States who has been hospitalized with the virus. The Louisiana patient was infected with a strain of the virus different from the one affecting dairy cows and causing sporadic cases in farmworkers in the U.S.",
      "Genetic analysis of two samples collected from the Louisiana patient suggest that the virus may have the ability to attach to cells in the human upper airway.",
      "That\u2019s worrisome, experts say, because bird flu viruses like H5N1 typically attach to cell receptors found in birds and other animals, but not commonly in humans. This is why bird flu typically doesn\u2019t infect humans or spread person to person. One of the mutations was also seen in a sample from a British Columbia teenager who was hospitalized with bird flu, the CDC said.",
      "While the findings show that the virus has the capacity to mutate in ways that could make it more transmissible to humans, experts stopped short of suggesting it's on the verge of a pandemic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that there\u2019s been spread from this person to others, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIt clearly means that we have to keep our attention on this, and if anything, ratchet it up even more.\u201d",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine and infectious disease expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said there\u2019s no evidence the mutations were \u201cfunctional,\u201d\u00a0meaning the virus could actually attach to the upper airway and replicate and spread to others.",
      "\u201cI think if there were clear and definitive evidence that the virus has mutated to the point that it can bind to the binding receptors in the upper respiratory tract, meaning the lining of the nose, the lining of the throat, the lining of the windpipe and therefore reproduce itself in the upper respiratory tract, that would be worrisome,\u201d Offit said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what the report said.\u201d",
      "In the report, the CDC said the detection \u201cunderscores the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance in people and animals, containment of avian influenza A(H5) outbreaks in dairy cattle and poultry, and prevention measures among people with exposure to infected animals or environments.\u201d",
      "The agency said that the risk to the general public hasn\u2019t changed and remains low.",
      "As of Friday, 65 confirmed human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., with the majority linked to exposure to infected poultry or dairy cows, according to the CDC. That number is likely an underestimate, however, as a CDC report published in November found evidence of asymptomatic bird flu infections in farmworkers. There is no evidence of person-to-person spread associated with any of the cases.",
      "The Louisiana patient was infected with a strain called D1.1, which is closely related to other viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the U.S. and in recent human cases in British Columbia, Canada and Washington state.",
      "The CDC said its analysis found no changes associated with markers that would mean antivirals, such as Tamflu, wouldn\u2019t work against the virus. That\u2019s one of the agency\u2019s criteria for deploying a bird flu vaccine.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who specializes in emerging infectious diseases, noted on the social media platform X that the mutations identified in the patient weren\u2019t present in samples from birds, indicating the changes developed within the patient after infection and aren\u2019t circulating in wildlife.",
      "She said that\u2019s \u201cgood news\u201d because \u201cit reduces risk of transmission to another person and suggests \u2018human-adapted\u2019 viruses aren\u2019t emerging in birds.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cthe H5N1 situation remains grim\u201d as human cases continue to rise, Rasmussen posted.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what combination of mutations would lead to a pandemic H5N1 virus and there\u2019s only so much we can predict from these sequence data,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the more humans are infected, the more chances a pandemic virus will emerge.\u201d"

    "summary": "States in the South and along the West Coast are seeing particularly high flu activity.",
    "story": [
      "The flu is ramping up after a slow start to the season.",
      "Positive tests rose 12% for the week ending Dec. 21, compared to the week prior, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 12,000 people were hospitalized from the virus, up from nearly 9,000 the week prior.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing upticks in both our inpatient hospitalizations as well as our community based metrics such as percentage of emergency room visits and test positivity,\u201d said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health. \u201cI certainly expect they\u2019re going to continue to go up since we\u2019re really entering flu season right now.\u201d",
      "Typically, flu activity starts to pick up around Halloween and peaks in February. This year, however, the virus got off to a later start, with activity only just picking up in recent weeks.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why that is, Roberts said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing the interplay of Covid here and how that is altering the other respiratory viral dynamics that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly are not back to the pre-Covid state of normalcy for most respiratory viruses.\u201d",
      "In the Midwest, doctors are also seeing a similar rise in flu activity.",
      "\u201cOver the last one to two weeks we\u2019ve been seeing a significant increase in flu as well as respiratory syncytial virus in our patient population,\u201d said Dr. Sindhu Aderson, medical director for the central region of Northwestern Immediate Care in Chicago.",
      "Flu activity was highest in Louisiana and Oregon the week ending Dec. 20, the CDC said. Activity was also high throughout the South and along the West Coast.",
      "How severe is this season\u2019s flu?",
      "So far this season, there have been an estimated 3.1 million illnesses, 37,000 hospitalizations and 1,500 deaths from the flu, according to the CDC.",
      "The last flu season, the CDC estimated that the virus was associated with 40 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths. While those with chronic conditions and people over the age of 65 are at a higher risk of severe illness, people of all ages can get very sick.",
      "At Yale New Haven Hospital, flu numbers are approximately half as high as they were this time last year, Roberts said, adding that he could count on one hand the amount of severe cases they\u2019ve had so far.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a handful of severe cases with people requiring mechanical ventilation even in some relatively healthy people with few comorbidities,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Five pediatric deaths were reported this week, the CDC said. A total of nine children have died so far this year.",
      "Dr. Sara Siddiqui, a pediatrician at NYU Langone Health in New York City, is seeing more children testing positive for the flu.",
      "\u201cIt becomes an exponential increase as Influenza can spread via aerosol droplets so schools and daycares are usually where we see the spread occuring,\u201d Siddiqui wrote in an email. \u201cFamilies with children are also seeing a rise in adult exposures who also become sick with respiratory viral illnesses.\u201d",
      "Two strains of influenza A \u2014 called H1N1 and H3N2 \u2014 accounted for the majority of positive tests. Both strains can cause severe illness.",
      "The CDC also said that five cases of H5 were reported. H5, or bird flu, is distinct from the seasonal flu and human-to-human transmission has not been detected in the U.S., the agency said.",
      "Is it too late to get a flu shot?",
      "The number of adults who have gotten their flu shot this year is similar to this time last year: a little under 42%, according to the CDC. Fewer kids, however, have gotten their flu shot this year.",
      "Experts say the best way to protect yourself and help reduce the chances of getting very sick is to get a flu shot. While it\u2019s too early to say how well this year\u2019s flu shot is working, the flu vaccine is typically between 40-60% effective and recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older.",
      "In previous seasons, 80% of children who died from the flu virus were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "A study published Friday in JAMA Network Open led by researchers at the CDC looked at pediatric data from nearly 16,000 children from 2015 to 2020 and found that the flu shot was at least about 50% effective at preventing illness at all levels of severe flu illness.",
      "The flu shot is estimated to have prevented 9.8 million illnesses, 4.8 million medical visits, 120,000 hospitalizations and 7,900 deaths last year.",
      "\u201cI think the best time is now\u201d for a flu shot, said Roberts. \u201cThe second best time is tomorrow.\u201d"

      "The New York-based company Handsome Brook Farms didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it can take several weeks for an illness to be identified as part of a food outbreak. Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover within a week, although the infection can be serious in young children, adults 65 and older or people with weakened immune systems.",
      "The targeted egg cartons were sold in 25 Costco stores in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee beginning Nov. 22.",
      "Customers with the eggs should return them to Costco for full refunds, the FDA said.",

    "summary": "The claims came after Elon Musk was involved in a public feud with some Republicans over immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk faced accusations of censorship Friday from fellow conservatives after several prominent right-wing accounts who had criticized Musk\u2019s views on immigration said that they subsequently lost access to premium features on Musk\u2019s social media app, X.",
      "At least 14 conservative accounts said late Thursday or Friday that X had revoked their blue verification badge, cutting them off from a variety of premium features, including the ability to monetize their accounts through subscriptions and advertising revenue-sharing, according to a review conducted by NBC News. Some accounts said the number of those affected was far higher.",
      "The accounts were all still active Friday, but without access to monetization features; some of them said they worried about their ability to keep posting.",
      "Some conservatives said they considered X\u2019s actions to be a betrayal by Musk, who purchased the service then known as Twitter in 2022 in part because he said it had unfairly limited conservative speech. Musk has since called himself a free-expression advocate, even as he calls for jailing some of his critics.",
      "Musk and X did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. But on Thursday night, about an hour before some conservatives started complaining about losing access to X\u2019s premium features, Musk posted what he called \u201ca reminder\u201d on X. He wrote that the site\u2019s algorithm automatically reduces the reach of a user if they\u2019re frequently blocked or muted by other, credible users.",
      "\u201cIf far more credible, verified subscriber accounts (not bots) mute/block your account compared to those who like your posts, your reach will decline significantly,\u201d Musk posted.",
      "But rather than satisfying people complaining about censorship, the post elicited even more accusations that Musk was shadowbanning his conservative critics, or reducing engagement on their posts without officially disclosing such actions to affected accounts.",
      "The actions by X came in the middle of a heated online debate on the subject of future immigration policy under President-elect Donald Trump, with anti-immigration MAGA loyalists denouncing the influence of pro-immigration tech executives and investors such as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.",
      "Many of the affected accounts said they were affiliated with one media brand in particular, ConservativeOG.",
      "Preston Parra, a 23-year-old influencer and head of ConservativeOG, said he considered the actions by X to be a \u201cpolitical takedown\u201d in retaliation for publicly disagreeing with Musk\u2019s pro-immigration views.",
      "He said he plans to keep fighting Musk, not only to get his premium features restored but also to ensure that Trump pursues restrictionist immigration policies.",

He said he believes Musk to be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d in the Trump camp.",
      "Trump announced that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d to much fanfare, shortly after the Nov. 5 election. But in recent days, after venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan was announced as a White House adviser on AI policy, Trump\u2019s tech-world allies \u2014 including Musk and Ramaswamy \u2014 have come under deeper scrutiny and criticism from the far-right for their previous statements about or involvement with legal immigration.",
      "Musk is an immigrant, having been born and raised in South Africa. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002.",
      "At least three of the affected X accounts have more than 1 million followers each, including the accounts of Ryan Fournier and Laura Loomer.",
      "Fournier, a co-founder of Students for Trump, said he had had a blue verified badge on the social media app since 2016. He wrote on X that he had \u201cno clue why\u201d he lost it this week. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Premium subscriptions on X include several benefits such as increased prominence in the replies to other accounts\u2019 posts and the ability to apply for sharing ad revenue.",
      "Loomer, a far-right activist and close Trump ally, said that X had demonetized her \u2014 cutting off her ability to collect subscription fees and other revenue on the site \u2014 and had revoked her blue verification checkmark about two days after she began criticizing Musk over tech industry visas.",
      "On Tuesday, Loomer wrote on X that tech billionaires \u201care like termites who have descended upon Palm Beach,\u201d where Trump is working on the presidential transition from his Mar-a-Lago resort. And she kept up her criticism as the week went on.",
      "Musk mentioned her in a post Thursday, writing: \u201cLoomer is trolling for attention. Ignore.\u201d",
      "And hours later, Loomer says her account lost access to premium features.",
      "\u201cLooks like Elon Musk is going to be silencing me for supporting original Trump immigration policies,\u201d she posted on X, calling the changes to her account \u201cretaliation.\u201d She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "It\u2019s not the first time that X and Musk have been accused of silencing users, despite Musk\u2019s vowed commitments to free speech. In September, X said it temporarily suspended a journalist for posting private personal information, after he shared a document that appeared to have been stolen from Trump\u2019s campaign. In 2022, the platform suspended the accounts of several other journalists who wrote about Musk.",

      "Season 2 adds a new twist to the games. After every round, players can vote to end the games or keep playing.",
      "With this addition of voting, tension brews amid the players as some want to continue risking their lives to increase the prize pot while others don't deem the risk worth it and want to go home.",
      "But how much money is really at stake?",
      "How much is $45.6 billion won in USD?",
      "In the show, $45.6 billion won is the prize if, like in Season 1, it comes down to a sole winner.",

      "Well, it's that time of year again, time for one... more ... game.",
      "Netflix's hit show \"Squid Game\" released its highly anticipated second season on Dec. 26, which consisted of seven episodes.",
      "The second season flashes forward a few years after Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a.k.a. Player 456, won the games. The trauma of everyone's death from Season 1 still weighs heavily on Gi-hun's conscience, causing him to devote himself and the $45.6 billion won (about $31 million dollars) he won to finding and ending the games once and for all.",
      "However, Gi-hun's plans go astray, causing him to be thrown back into the games once more with an entire new set of players.",
      "This time, the twist is that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) who orchestrated all the games during Season 1 decided to enter the games himself, posing as Young-il, Player 001. The Front Man, whose real name is In-Ho, is a former winner of the games.",
      "Gi-hun, who once again plays as Player 456, makes his way through the games, beginning (like Season 1) with Red Light, Green Light, but adding in two new games afterwards: Pentathlon and Mingle.",
      "This season adds the twist that after each round, all players vote to decide if they want to continue the games or end them there.",
      "As the season progresses, Young-il (the Front Man in disguise) befriends Gi-hun, gaining his trust by explaining his own tragic backstory. He says his pregnant wife is dying and he joined the games to get the money to save her and his unborn child. However, viewers know the Front Man's wife already has died.",
      "This duo forms an alliance with other characters, including Gi-hun's best friend from Season 1 Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan) who is also a competitor this season and ex-marine Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul).",
      "Season 2 also introduces new players like mother and son duo Park Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), crypto currency influencer Lee Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan), pregnant player Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri) and rapper Thanos (Choi Seung-hyun), amongst others.",
      "Outside of the games, Detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun), who Front Man seemingly shot and killed in the Season 1 finale, is actually alive. He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",
      "As Gi-hun fights within the games to end them and keep as many people alive as possible, Jun-ho searches for the island with the help of allies Gi-hun enlisted before entering the games a second time.",
      "However, the captain of the boat who has been assisting Jun-ho in finding the island is revealed to be secretly tampering with their search.",
      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",
      "When the guards come in to break up the fight, Gi-hun and his friends, who were playing dead, jump the guards and grab their guns, killing all but one in the process.",
      "Gi-hun instructs the surviving guard to bring them to his captain. The rebel crew shoot out the cameras before continuing on through the island fortress.",
      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",
      "Gi-hun tries to fight back but is wrestled to the ground by pink suited workers as the Front Man (whom Gi-hun still doesn't know is Young-il) walks away.",
      "The show fades to black on Gi-hun screaming with grief as his head is pushed into the ground, forcing him to look at Jung-bae and the pool of blood spilling from him.",
      "What does the post-credit scene mean for Season 3?",
      "The post-credit scene is a brief clip of players walking up to the motion sensor doll from Red Light, Green Light. This time, there's a second gigantic doll across from the original one.",
      "The quick scene ends as the light turns from red to green, hinting that the games continue in some form after the failed coup.",
      "Show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk \"originally envisioned seasons 2 and 3 as a single story,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",

And Blue joined her famous mom in the spotlight on Christmas Day during a halftime performance at a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Beyonc\u00e9's hometown team, the Houston Texans.",
      "In September 2024, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke to GQ about the delicate balance of being a global star and mother.",
      "\"I build my work schedule around my family,\" she told GQ. \"I try to only tour when my kids are out of school.\"",
      "Despite their unique childhood, Beyonc\u00e9 says she does her best to ensure her children enjoy private lives.",
      "\"One thing I\u2019ve worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn\u2019t turned into a brand,\" she said. \"It\u2019s very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art. I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.\"",
      "While parenting and sustaining a high-profile career has its challenges, she's also described it as deeply rewarding.",

      "In 2021, at 9 years old, Blue became the second youngest person to ever win a Grammy\u00a0for her collaboration with her mother and Wizkid on the song \u201cBrown Skin Girl.\u201d That same year, the song received an\u00a0MTV Video Music Award\u00a0and a\u00a0BET Award.",

      "\"She\u2019s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage,\" she said. \"Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, Blue joined Beyonc\u00e9's halftime performance at the Ravens and Texans game in Houston. She stood alongside her mom during \"Texas Hold 'Em\" to close out the set of songs from \"Cowboy Carter.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 honored her daughter's guest appearance by sneaking in a small lyric change, adding: \"Then spin me in the middle, Blue, I can\u2019t read your mind.\"",
      "While Blue is the most public of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s three children, she has managed to maintain a balance between her public appearances and private life.\u00a0On Feb. 20, 2024, she was seen supporting her mom at the launch of Beyonc\u00e9's new hair care line, C\u00e9cred, in LA. Then, at the 2024 Grammys, Jay-Z brought his daughter onstage to accept the second annual\u00a0Dr. Dre\u00a0Global Impact Award that he received at the event.",
      "In his acceptance speech, he gave Blue a shoutout, saying, \u201cThank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue\u2019s grown up now. She doesn\u2019t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys.\u201d",
      "Carter's eldest has been involved with voice work at a young age. In November 2020, Blue narrated Matthew A. Cherry\u2019s audiobook \u201cHair Love.\u201d In April 2024, Disney announced that she would voice cub Kiara, the daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, in Disney's new live-action prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 will also star in the project, voicing Nala.",

      "\"She\u2019s self-taught and she sounds like a concert pianist,\u201d Knowles said of Blue. \u201cShe paints, she draws, she does poetry. She\u2019s just an artistic soul.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really, really proud of her. I can\u2019t wait until the world gets to really hear.\u201d",
      "One of the highlights of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s massive \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour was having her daughter join her onstage as a dancer during her performance.",
      "Rumi Carter, 6",
      "Rumi Carter is the elder of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Like her twin brother, Sir Carter, Rumi was born on June 13, 2017.",
      "In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2019 Netflix documentary,\u00a0\"Homecoming,\" she opened up about the \u201cextremely difficult pregnancy\" that she went through when she had Rumi and Sir.",
      "\"My body went through more than I knew it could,\u201d she said in the documentary.",

      "\"To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I\u2019m in no rush to get rid of it,\" she said at the time. \"I think it\u2019s real.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's twins have since been featured in a few projects that she's worked on like her\u00a0\"Black is King\"\u00a0visual album, where they made an appearance. Rumi was also in the music video for \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\" along with her sister.",
      "Rumi also took center stage in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album. In the singer\u2019s song \u201cProtector,\u201d Rumi is heard asking her mom, \u201cCan I hear the lullaby please?\u201d at the beginning.",
      "The song appears to be a tribute to her children, with Beyonc\u00e9 singing about motherhood.",
      "She says, \u201cI first saw your face in your father\u2019s gaze/ There\u2019s a long line of hands carryin\u2019 your name, mm/ Liftin\u2019 you up, so you will be raised/ Even though I know someday you\u2019re going to shine on your own/ I will be your projector, yeah.\u201d",
      "Sir Carter, 6",
      "Sir Carter is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s youngest, though only by a minute, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Sir was born on  June 13, 2017, with his twin sister Rumi.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",
      "Lively said in a statement, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",

In the complaint, Lively accuses Baldoni of sexual harassment and partaking in a smear campaign with intention to harm her reputation.",
      "In a statement provided exclusively to TODAY.com, Slate said she stands by her \u201cloyal friend\u201d and \u201ctrusted source of emotional support.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Blake Lively\u2019s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,\u201d Slate said. \u201cBlake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her.\u201d",

      "The book and film have both been enveloped in controversy after some said the plot romanticized domestic abuse. Also, ahead of the film\u2019s release, fans started to speculate about possible tension between Lively and Baldoni when they didn\u2019t appear together to promote the movie."

      "Mainland China continues to be the main source of tourists, accounting for more than 75% in October. But China\u2019s economic malaise has curtailed spending in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese visitors, many of whom make day trips from the city of Shenzhen across the border.",
      "Other ideas for revitalizing Hong Kong, such as the \u201cmega-event economy,\u201d have hit roadblocks as political sensitivities remain high. In February, the public was outraged when soccer star Lionel Messi failed to play in a heavily promoted exhibition game. Though Messi said he was too injured to play, fans and even government officials accused him of having \u201cpolitical motives.\u201d",
      "There are hopes that the panda campaign will go better.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a sight to see for first-time tourists like me,\u201d said Carol Lee Furiate, a visitor from California who had been to Hong Kong before but not the Big Buddha, a 112-foot bronze monument where about 70 panda sculptures are on display this month in the surrounding village and the cable car leading up to it.",
      "Even for visitors enjoying the panda exhibition at the Big Buddha, however, there was skepticism as to how much impact such events would have on the local economy.",
      "\u201cAfter taking pictures, people will leave. Will they stay here to eat or shop? Probably not,\u201d said Margaret Koon, a Hong Kong resident visiting the Big Buddha.",
      "Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the pandas would not be a big draw for international tourists because they are \u201cnot something that\u2019s part of the Hong Kong identity.\u201d Mainland Chinese tourists, meanwhile, can see plenty of pandas at home.",
      "Hong Kong should be trying to differentiate itself from other Chinese cities, Low said, and focusing on what makes it unique.",
      "He said global tourism is also moving away from high-end dining and shopping and tourist attractions and toward \u201cexperiencing the city as locals would.\u201d",
      "\u201cHong Kong has a lot to offer in terms of varied, diverse urban experiences,\u201d he said, adding that the city is \u201cvisually very stunning\u201d and complex.",
      "\u201cI think people who visit want to soak in that complexity,\u201d he said."

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:48:24 GMT",
    "summary": "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point.",
    "story": [
      "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point. The deadly incident in Magdeburg was another example of Islamist terrorism, they said \u2014 and a result of the mass immigration they so vehemently oppose.",
      "Except it wasn\u2019t that simple.",
      "The suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was in fact scathingly critical of Islam and immigration, according to his past posts on X. He aligned himself with the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is endorsed by Musk and monitored by German intelligence agencies for suspected extremism. While authorities say the motive is not yet clear, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect \u201cwas obviously Islamophobic.\u201d",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s complex worldview, in which he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but also Germany\u2019s alleged failure to protect Saudi immigrants from the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s repression, has muddied attempts to use his alleged killing of five people and injuring 200 others as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim cautionary tale. It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",
      "There has been \u201czero\u201d contrition from those on the right who sought to capitalize on the incident, said Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group focused on radical ideologies.",
      "Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has backed far-right figures in Europe, wrote on X that the \u201clegacy media lies again\u201d when news outlets, including NBC News, reported that officials described the suspect as Islamophobic.",
      "Other figures who were quick to interpret the attack have since kept quiet.",
      "\u201cThey despise our values,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders posted Friday on X. \u201cThis is our land, our freedom, our life. And we\u2019ll defend it and never surrender.\u201d",
      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",
      "These kinds of \u201cweirdo, individual, radical, conspiratorial worldviews\u201d are \u201ca phenomenon that has been rising steadily since the coronavirus, since we all moved our lives online and on social media,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "He said this does not absolve German authorities, who were given an unspecified warning about al-Abdulmohsen last year. Musk posted that he \u201cshould never have been allowed to enter Germany\u201d and \u201cshould have been extradited.\u201d",
      "NBC News emailed X requesting comment about the criticism of Musk\u2019s remarks, as well as accusations that X failed to act on violent posts from the suspect, but the company did not respond.",
      "The competing narratives over al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s acts and beliefs look set to continue this week, with the AfD holding a memorial service for the victims, which some critics have derided as insensitive political opportunism.",
      "\u201cA bloody act like the one that occurred yesterday in #Magdeburg must never be repeated!\u201d the local AfD X account posted. \u201cLet us ensure that Magdeburg and Saxony-Anhalt become a place of carefree coexistence again.\u201d"

      "\u201cResuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\u201d at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \u201cdespite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 p.m.\u201d",

He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the wife of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was re-elected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party\u2019s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",

      "\u201cAs our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Modi said in a post on the social platform X.

He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",

In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",

      "Singh was a member of India\u2019s upper house of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country\u2019s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country\u2019s various states.",

      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",

      "Xaver, who recently retired as a college professor in upstate New York, said after the tsunami she focused less on personal ambition and more on helping others, including by telling her story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t wish ever a disaster of this magnitude on anyone, and I certainly don\u2019t wish that this many people perish,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wish everybody had a scare in their life, something that knocked them upside the head a little bit to say, you know what? This isn\u2019t all about you. There\u2019s more to this world, and it\u2019s about love.\u201d"
