      "A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a work environment filled with fear and psychological pressure at her fashion brand",
      "A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a \u201cwork environment filled with fear and psychological pressure\u201d at her fashion brand, Djerf Avenue.",
      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",
      "The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and \u201cher favorites.\u201d One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood, so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood \u2014 so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming.",
      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",
      "\u201cMy mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but the movie can\u2019t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,\u2019\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Don&rsquo;t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L&aacute;zl&oacute; T&oacute;th",
    "story": [
      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "LONDON -- Six-time Grammy Award winner Jacob Collier, a fresh voice in contemporary jazz, took an unexpected approach to the final installment of the four-part album series, \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d",
      "Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions.",
      "One track on \u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d is titled \u201c100,000 Voices,\" and it quite literally features that many singers.",
      "\u201cThere's like over 100,000 people on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cOver 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.\u201d",
      "His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.",
      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",
      "Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (\u201cDjesse Vol. 3\u201d was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's \u201cfolklore.\u201d) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Billie Eilish.",
      "\u201cIt's thrilling and wild,\u201d he says of the honor.",
      "\u201cThe album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,\u201d he says of \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it\u2019s a really thrilling predicament.\u201d",
      "Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be \u201ca leader of a choir,\u201d in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. \u201cI really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,\" he says. \"And if they can feel welcome, then they\u2019re a part of the music.\u201d",
      "\u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin.",
      "But now that Collier has completed the \u201cDjesse\u201d series, what's next?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear idea of exactly what\u2019s coming next, which I love, actually. Sometimes in life you need those moments of question marks,\" he says.",
      "\"I\u2019ve got like about a billion ideas, but I haven\u2019t committed to any yet because I think I need a moment just to sort of recalibrate and see.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",

      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",
      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still.",
      "In Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the Spanish director\u2019s first English-language feature film, Julianne Moore plays Ingrid, a celebrated author who\u2019s just written a book about death. She\u2019s at a book signing in New York when she hears that an old friend, a war correspondent named Martha Hunt ( Tilda Swinton ), has been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Ingrid rushes to Martha in the hospital, and the two friends, who haven\u2019t seen each other in years, quickly get reacquainted. Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A new novel from Kiran Desai, her first fiction since the Booker Prize-winning \u201cThe Inheritance of Loss\u201d came out nearly 20 years ago, will be published next fall.",
      "Desai's \u201cThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny\u201d is scheduled for release in September by Hogarth, an imprint of the Random House Publishing Group.

      "\u201cUsing the comic lens of an endlessly unresolved romance between two modern Indians, \u2018The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny\u2019 examines Western and Eastern notions and manifestations of love and solitude as they play out across the geographical and emotional terrain of today\u2019s globalized world,\" Desai said in a statement Wednesday. \"I think only a novel can get at the raw truth regarding what people are privately thinking and negotiating.\u201d",
      "The 53-year-old Desai debuted in 1998 with \u201cHullabaloo in the Guava Orchard,\u201d the comic tale of a young man who chooses to spend his life in a tree. Eight years later, she received international acclaim for \u201cThe Inheritance of Loss,\u201d released in the U.S. by Atlantic Monthly Press. Winner of the Booker and the National Book Critics Circle award, her novel follows the lives of an undocumented Indian immigrant in the U.S. and of an Anglicized Indian overseas in the state of West Bengal. Desai was 35 when she received the Booker, the youngest woman at the time to win the prize.",
      "Desai's editor at Hogarth, David Ebershoff, said in a statement that her new book is \u201can expansive tale of multiple generations, a novel infused with equal amounts of heart and mind.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- A British court ruled Wednesday that police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds ($3.3 million) to cover years of unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan.",
      "The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.",
      "At Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost $12 million into an account in the name of J, were a \u201cstraightforward cheat\u201d of the tax authorities.",
      "\u201cI am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they have engaged in long-standing, deliberate conduct in order to evade their tax,\" Golspring said in his ruling.",
      "The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, so Goldspring only had to decide on the balance of probabilities whether the Tates had evaded tax.",
      "A lawyer for the police force said that the Tates were \u201cserial\u201d tax evaders who failed to pay any tax on 21 million pounds in revenue from their online businesses, including War Room, Hustlers\u2019 University, Cobra Tate and OnlyFans, between 2014 and 2022.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, accused the government of \u201coutright theft\u201d for freezing his accounts and seizing \u201ceverything they could.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not justice; it\u2019s a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system,\" Tate said in a statement. \u201cThis raises serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.\u201d",
      "At a hearing in July, attorney Sarah Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: \u201cWhen I lived in England I refused to pay tax.\u201d",
      "She said J \u2014 who can't be named because of a court order \u2014 wasn't involved with the brothers' businesses.",
      "A lawyer for the brothers, Martin Evans, argued that the bank transfers were \u201centirely orthodox\u201d for people who run online businesses. He said the siblings spent money on a number of \u201cexotic motor cars,\u201d but did nothing illegal.",
      "Court documents show an estimated total of 2,683,345.88 pounds (about $3.4 million) is held in the seven accounts police can now seize.",
      "Devon and Cornwall Police said after the ruling that \"from the outset, we have aimed to demonstrate that Andrew and Tristan Tate evaded taxes and laundered money through bank accounts located in Devon,\" a county in southwest England. The force said it would not comment further until the end of a 28-day appeal period.",
      "Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer and dual British-U.S. citizen who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X. He has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments.",
      "He and Tristan Tate, 36, face criminal allegations in Romania, including human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women. They are set to be extradited to the U.K. once those proceedings are over to face further allegations of rape and human trafficking.",
      "The Tates deny all the allegations.",

      "Hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion has asked a court to issue a restraining order against rapper Tory Lanez",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

      "\u201cWicked\u201d also moved forward in several categories, like hair and makeup, original score, sound and visual effects. The adaptation of the Broadway musical did not include original songs and therefore wasn\u2019t eligible in that category.",

      "\u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d included in visual effects, sound and makeup and hair, was notably not among the 20 score finalists.

    "story": [
      "Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams has been named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris",
      "PARIS -- Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral\u2019s reopening earlier this month.",
      "Williams said he hoped to \u201cdeepen that sense of unity and togetherness\u201d in work that \u201cevens the odds for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: \u201cGrowing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.\"",
      "The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage.",
      "The U.N. agency said Williams will be \u201ca mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.\u201d",
      "Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase.",
      "Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO\u2019s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity.",
      "UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency\u2019s work.",
      "Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year.",
      "The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency.",
      "The U.S. return under President Joe Biden was marked by a flag-raising ceremony attended by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden."

      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in theaters Thursday, takes audiences back to Mufasa's days as a cub and explains how he and Scar came to be brothers",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d has one very important thing going for it: an original story.",
      "That may seem like faint praise or at least a very, very low bar in the grand scheme of things. But in a landscape where Disney continues to remake its animated catalogue in slightly different, and usually less interesting, forms whether \u201clive action\u201d or \u201cphotorealistic\u201d that usually only serves to remind how good the 2D animation was, originality is not to be undervalued.",
      "And this story isn\u2019t simply checking off fan service boxes and overexplaining origins that never needed them: It\u2019s actually good. A prequel to \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d opening in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s a tale of found family, betrayal and destiny, one that begins to explain the estrangement between brothers Scar and Mufasa that we all know will end in murder, how Mufasa ( Aaron Pierre ) ends up as king of the pride lands and, perhaps most importantly, why only one has an English accent.",
      "In this telling, Scar was once Taka (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), destined to be king of his pride, and Mufasa was a lost cub, separated from his parents in a dramatic flood. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him into his family. His mother (Thandiwe Newton) embraces the newcomer; his father (Lennie James) rejects him as nothing but a stray. Not that it matters much to the cubs; both are thrilled to have a brother. They play and protect one another and grow up together. But fissures start to appear in this foundation as Mufasa emerges as the exceptional one and Taka as the coward. And then a lioness enters the picture in Sarabi (Tiffany Boone). We\u2019ve all seen enough movies to know what happens with that.",
      "The screenplay comes from veteran screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, whose credits include the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d this year\u2019s lovely \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d and \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d He clearly took a corporate mandate (give us more \u201cLion King\u201d) and made the absolute least cynical version of that. There are still questionable corporate-feeling choices, like straining to tie it to a current and future \u201cLion King\u201d by having Rafiki (John Kani) tell the story to Simba (Donald Glover) and Nala\u2019s ( Beyonc\u00e9 ) daughter Kiara ( Blue Ivy Carter ), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and Timon (Billy Eichner). These comedic breaks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s songs peppered throughout, aren\u2019t additive. They really only serve to break up the momentum of the compelling main story.",
      "But the biggest issue remains the form itself. The photo-realistic computer-generated animals may have technically improved since the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d but they still aren\u2019t movie stars like their 2D animation counterparts. Impressive though it may be intellectually, the reality of watching these animals for two hours is a somewhat numbing and dull experience despite the best efforts of director Barry Jenkins. The Oscar-winning filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d did an admirable job adding visual interest and color into the landscapes, bringing it closer to the vibrancy of animation than ever before, and making it as cinematic as possible. The original story also helps here in that he was never going to have to recreate iconic sequences in a less stimulating form. There are just inherent limitations that filmmakers have not yet figured out, including how odd it looks for these animals\u2019 mouths to be moving and speaking English words. It\u2019s strangest when they\u2019re singing, mouths agape to hold the long notes in a way that no lion\u2019s mouth should ever appear.",
      "If this is one future for filmmaking there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement and experimentation. That doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be embraced while the kinks are worked out. But it also doesn\u2019t mean the moviegoing public has to get excited about every rehash. \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d is better than the ones that came before it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great.",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cperil, action/violence and some thematic elements.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "The FTC said consumers often see advertised prices for hotel rooms, short-term rentals, and tickets to sporting events and concerts only to be surprised later by so-called \u201cjunk fees,\u201d including resort fees, cleaning fees, processing fees and other extra charges.",
      "\u201cPeople deserve to know up front what they\u2019re being asked to pay without worrying that they\u2019ll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven\u2019t budgeted for and can\u2019t avoid,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.",
      "The rule is scheduled to go into effect in 120 days.",
      "Ticketmaster said Tuesday it supports the new rule.",

      "Four of the FTC\u2019s five commissioners voted to approve the rule. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, \u2013 who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was the one dissenting vote.",
      "The rule requires lodging and ticketing businesses to clearly and conspicuously disclose the true cost \u2013 including all mandatory fees \u2013 when they display any pricing. Businesses that exclude taxes or shipping fees from advertised prices must also disclose them before customers enter any payment information.",
      "The FTC estimates the rule will save U.S. consumers 53 million hours per year of time spent searching for the true price of lodging or events.",

      "Junk fees and deceptive pricing are also one of the reasons the Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, earlier this year. The government asked a court to separate the companies, saying they have a monopoly on concert promotion and ticketing that drives up price for consumers.",
      "The Biden administration also has targeted the fee practices of U.S. airlines, banks and online payment platforms."

      "Panto is as much a part of Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies",
      "LONDON -- Here\u2019s a recipe as essential to Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies.",
      "Mix a fairy-tale plot with topical references, slapstick, song, dance and double entendres. Drench in sequins and spangles, mix vigorously, add some noisy audience participation, and you have a panto.",
      "Pantos \u2014 short for pantomimes \u2014 are stage musicals that play at theaters big and small across the U.K. each winter. Formulaic but anarchic, family friendly but a little risque, they are a holiday tradition that give many children their first exposure to live theater \u2014 and adults a chance to cut loose.",
      "Anyone who thinks Britons are buttoned up hasn't been to a panto. Audiences happily shed their inhibitions \u2013 cheering, singing, hissing the villain, shouting \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d to warn the hero.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s singing, dancing, laughing \u2014 taking the family out and being able to be out with their kids and letting the kids run riot,\u201d said Clive Rowe, who directed and stars in \u201cDick Whittington and his Cat\u201d at the Hackney Empire \u2014 his 17th annual panto for the storied east London theater.",
      "Pantomime has deep roots, stretching back to the stock characters and bawdy humor of the 16th-century Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and the French harlequinade, as well as the English music hall. By the late 19th century, the elements had gelled into a form still recognizable today.",
      "The plots are drawn from well-known fairy tales and children\u2019s stories such as \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cCinderella.\u201d Characters include a plucky hero, or \u201cprincipal boy,\u201d often played by a woman, an outrageous villain, and a \u201cdame,\u201d a sharp-tongued matron who is always played by a man in fabulously flamboyant drag.",
      "\u201cThe pantomime dame is the beating heart of the show,\u201d said Simon Sladen, curator of theater and performance at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cShe is that engine that drives it. Firstly with pace and anarchy, but also a little bit of sauce on the side.\u201d",
      "An estimated 3 million people in Britain attend a pantomime each year, in venues ranging from small regional theaters to London West End playhouses. Many theaters rely on them for a big chunk of their annual income.",
      "When London\u2019s theaters were closed for months by pandemic lockdowns in 2020, panto dames led a protest march through the city to stress their importance to the creative economy.",
      "They provide seasonal work to faded pop stars, television entertainers, the occasional Hollywood celebrity \u2014 Pamela Anderson took Liverpool by storm when she starred in \u201cAladdin\u201d in 2010, singing \u201cSanta Baby\u201d while suspended on a swing above the stage, dressed in costumes by Vivienne Westwood.",
      "They are also vital experience for many young actors, including the A-listers of tomorrow.",
      "Jude Law told The Associated Press recently that he\u2019d played Humpty Dumpty, recalling his performance as \u201cloud and round.\u201d At 17, Michael Fassbender played one of Cinderella\u2019s Ugly Sisters, and a tree.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Jonathan Bailey starred alongside a young Nicholas Hoult in a production of \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Hoult also appeared in \u201cMother Goose\u201d as a child, and says he would happily do another, as they\u2019re \u201creally fun.\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up the art form, Bailey called it a \u201cquintessentially British bloody good time for all the family.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s pantos often strive to reflect diversity, both onstage and in the audience. Rowe, whose Hackney Empire pantos draw many of their cast and crew from Britain\u2019s Black communities, said that at its core the genre is \u201cabout acceptance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, it\u2019s about the idea that being different isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be brought in and kind of celebrated and that no matter where you are in society, from the youngest to the oldest, we all have a place and we should embrace that.\u201d",
      "Drag performer Ginger Johnson, starring in an adult \u201call-drag panto\u201d version of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d at London\u2019s Phoenix Theatre, said that panto\u2019s ability to change is \u201cwhy it\u2019s managed to survive for so long as a cultural form.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of kids, panto is the first time that they come in contact with drag as well,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Stage historian Sladen said that some are leaning into the drag element of panto, with \u201ca bigger, wider explosion of roles than just the dame and the principal boy being cross-dressed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe might see the fairy godmother played by a dame or played by a drag artist. We might see a wicked stepmother, also played by a very well-known drag performer. So (it\u2019s) constantly evolving, constantly changing with the times.\u201d",

      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:27 -0500",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",

That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",

      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment.

      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern year after year introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",

      "Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there\u2019s a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.",
      "With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California\u2019s Inland Empire.",
      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",
      "Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world\u2019s largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.",
      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",

      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby says he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution\u2019s leading expert changed his opinion on how three infants died",
      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",
      "An inquiry currently underway to examine failures by the hospital to recognize why babies were dying and why they took so long to stop Letby opened in September against a backdrop of experts and others who have questioned evidence used against Letby.",
      "A group of scientists, doctors and legal experts that independently reviewed scientific evidence from Letby\u2019s trial warned Britain\u2019s ministers of health and justice that legal systems were \u201cparticularly vulnerable to errors\u201d when dealing with technical matters, \u201cespecially in cases involving statistical anomalies in health care settings.\u201d",
      "Evans gave his new opinions on the death of infants identified in court as Baby C, Baby I and Baby P in a signed response to a Channel 5 documentary, McDonald said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure Dr. Evans is still going to say that Lucy Letby is guilty and he has a different view or different hypothesis in relation to it,\" McDonald said. \u201cBut the cause of death that was before the Court of Appeal is different now, according to Dr. Evans, and I think that is a profound issue that needs to be relooked at.\u201d",
      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said."

      "Experts say that the holidays can put a strain on your mental health",
      "Bells are ringing. Snow is glistening. But you\u2019re bummed out.",
      "You could be suffering from a case of the holiday blues, which experts say is not uncommon.",
      "A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cA lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,\u201d said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling.",
      "\"You\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.",
      "Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the holidays, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.",
      "\u201cCertainly this year, I think with the recent election, there\u2019s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you\u2019re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can bring up strong emotions.\u201d",
      "Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?",
      "It\u2019s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event \u2014 and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.",
      "And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.",
      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

      "Officials say Pakistan has begun its last nationwide vaccination campaign for the year to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases hampered efforts to stop the disease",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan on Monday began its last nationwide vaccination campaign for the year to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases hampered efforts to stop the disease, officials said.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the potentially fatal, paralyzing virus hasn\u2019t been stopped,",
      "Pakistan has reported 63 confirmed cases since January.",
      "Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister\u2019s adviser for the polio eradication program, said the anti-polio drive will continue until Dec. 22.",
      "\u201cAs a mother, I am appealing to you to open your doors for health workers,\" she said.",
      "Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns despite violence affecting medical personnel who oversee the vaccinations and security forces escorting them. Militants falsely claim that vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.",
      "Authorities deployed thousands of police officers to protect health workers following intelligence reports that insurgents could target them. However, gunmen opened fire Monday on police escorting polio workers in Karak, a city in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing a police officer and wounding a health worker, local police official Ayaz Khan said.",
      "Also on Monday, a gunman riding on a motorcycle shot and wounded a police officer assigned to escort polio workers from a health facility in the northwestern city of Bannu, said local police chief Hamid Khan.",
      "No one has claimed responsibility for the twin attacks. But more than 200 polio workers and police assigned for their protection have been killed since the 1990s, according to health officials and authorities.",
      "The latest anti-polio drive campaign began a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with medical staff and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio.",
      "Afghanistan reported at least 23 confirmed cases in 2024, according to data from the World Health Organization.",
      "In September, the Afghan Taliban suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, a devastating setback for polio eradication as the virus is one of the world\u2019s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.",

      "Health and tourism officials in Fiji say seven foreign tourists have been hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Seven foreign tourists were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar, Fijian authorities said on Monday.",
      "The cause of their illness was not known and officials said it was too soon to know if tainted alcohol was involved.",
      "Those who became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday included Australians and an American, according to local news reports. They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, said Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Two people remained in the hospital, conscious and in stable condition, Fiji's Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka told reporters on Monday. One person was discharged on Sunday and four others on Monday.",
      "David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalized, told Sky News Australia that his relatives had been released from the hospital and were due to fly home on Monday night.",
      "Local news outlets reported on Sunday that the cause of the foreigners' illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos in November in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming tainted drinks.",
      "But Tudravu said no cause had been identified in the Fiji episode. Police have ordered toxicology tests and are awaiting results \u2014 which are expected to take three or four days \u2014 Gavoka said.",
      "The bar was full of customers on Saturday night and many had ordered pi\u00f1a coladas, the drink consumed by those who became ill, said the official.",
      "Gavoka said no other reports of similar illness were recorded at the resort or across Fiji, a South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said. The hotel, located on the picturesque Coral Coast of the largest island, Viti Levu, has operated for many years and \u201cholds a strong reputation,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cThis is the only reported case of its kind that we\u2019ve experienced in recent memory, and certainly nothing like this has been experienced this year,\u201d Gavoka said.",
      "Australia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that officials are providing consular assistance to two Australian families in Fiji.",
      "The ministry did not comment on the cause of the Australians' illness, but its website advising tourists was updated on Monday to caution travelers about \u201cpotential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the resort, Savaira Molaucake, said staff were \u201cconducting a thorough investigation\u201d of the incident and were working closely with authorities."

      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks requiring Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",
      "During her first sober holiday season last year, Haydel reveled in meaningful conversations and the joy of waking up feeling good each morning with clear memories of the night before.",
      "\u201cSobriety is the gift that you keep on giving to your future self over and over and over again,\u201d says Eliott Edge, who manages Hekate, the sober bar.",
      "Focus on enjoying this very real gift, Baily says. Take your time getting dressed, visualizing yourself having a great time, and imagine how you\u2019ll feel as your head hits the pillow when you get home.",
      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best bits of the evening,\u201d Baily says, \u201cand there are no costs.\u201d"

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president on Wednesday unveiled a bilingual \u201chymn\u201d to Mexican migrants living in the United States, even as migrants from other countries continue to suffer abuses, delays and hostility in Mexico.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum used her morning news briefing to present the song \u201cMigrant Hymn.\u201d The lyrics, a mix of English and Spanish, include lines like \u201cwhere we are from, no nos rajamos\u201d (we don't give up).",
      "Sheinbaum called Mexican migrants \u201cheroes,\u201d in part because they sent $63 billion back home to relatives in Mexico last year.",
      "Stressing migrants' loyalty to Mexico, the song says \u201cCambiamos de lugar, no de bandera\u201d (we change our location, not our flag).",
      "While about 11 million Mexicans live in the United States \u2014 including about 5 million without proper documents \u2014 many had to flee Mexico because of violence or lack of opportunities, and it remains unclear how loyal or closely tied they remain to the government.",
      "On the same day the hymn was unveiled, a migrant shelter in the northern border city of Reynosa announced it could no longer accept newcomers, because gangs were kidnapping so many migrants from its doorstep.",
      "Rev. H\u00e9ctor Silva, who runs the Senda de la Vida (Path of Life) in Reynosa, across from McAllen, Texas, said the situation is so dangerous in the cartel-dominated border city that police escort migrants to appointments for their U.S. asylum applications.",
      "\u201cUntil people have security and they stop kidnapping migrants when they arrive ... we don't want any more arriving,\u201d said Silva.",
      "Also on Wednesday, a new caravan of migrants began walking north toward the U.S. border from the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The migrants said they were tired of being blocked from crossing Mexico by the government.",
      "But they have little or no chance of making it more than a few dozen miles. In November, Mexican officials broke up two similar migrant caravans.",
      "Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 which were provided buses to ride part of the way north \u2014 no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it.",
      "For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.",
      "This week, the human rights group Doctors Without Borders wrote in a report that \u201chundreds of thousands of migrants, the majority of whom are crossing to reach the United States, fall into limbo in Mexico, hemmed in by violence.\u201d",

      "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who said he will go to the European Court of Human Rights, after his conviction in a corruption case was made definitive by France\u2019s highest court, has been involved in a series of legal proceedings",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s former President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose conviction in a corruption case was made definitive by France's highest court Wednesday, has been involved in a series of legal proceedings in recent years.",
      "Another trial is to open next month over alleged Libya financing for his 2007 presidential campaign.",
      "Sarkozy, 69, who was France's president from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. He retired from active politics in 2017.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at legal cases involving him.",
      "France\u2019s Court of Cassation on Wednesday upheld an appeal court decision which had found Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country\u2019s head of state.",
      "Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet as provided by French law.",
      "He said he would bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Sarkozy was first found guilty in 2021 by a Paris court, a verdict confirmed in 2023 by an appeals court, for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated.",
      "Sarkozy and 12 others will go on trial in January 2025 on charges that his 2007 presidential campaign received millions in illegal financing from the government of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Sarkozy has been under investigation in the case since 2013. He is charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, embezzlement of Libyan public funds and criminal association.",
      "Investigators examined claims that Gadhafi\u2019s government secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros ($52.3 million) for his winning 2007 campaign. The sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time and would violate French rules against foreign campaign financing.",
      "The investigation gained traction when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff. Takieddine later withdrew the allegation and Sarkozy sought to have the inquiry closed.",
      "After becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to France with high honors later that year. Sarkozy then put France at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes that helped rebel fighters topple Gadhafi\u2019s government in 2011.",
      "French investigative judges filed preliminary charges last year against Sarkozy for his alleged involvement in an attempt to mislead magistrates in order to clear him in the Libya financing case.",
      "Financial prosecutors said Sarkozy is suspected of \u201cbenefitting from corruptly influencing a witness\u201d \u2014 Takieddine \u2014 who accused him of receiving illegal campaign financing from Libya.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was given preliminary charges in July this year for alleged involvement in efforts to pressure Takieddine. Bruni-Sarkozy was placed under judicial supervision, which includes a ban on contact with all those involved in the proceedings with the exception of her husband.",
      "In February this year, an appeals court in Paris upheld a guilty verdict against the former president for illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 re-election bid. Sarkozy was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "Sarkozy is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande.",
      "Lawyers for Sarkozy, who has denied all allegations, have appealed to the Court of Cassation against the sentence in that case."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Syria&rsquo;s nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the highly addictive drug Captagon",
    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the highly addictive drug Captagon",
      "BEIRUT -- Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug.",
      "Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018.",
      "\u201cAssad\u2019s collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,\u201d Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. \u201cThey came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn\u2019t burn everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,\u201d Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site.",
      "Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream.",
      "The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations \u2014 revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad\u2019s power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry.",
      "Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties.",
      "Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue.",
      "Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria\u2019s economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it.",
      "Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs.",
      "The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-2019 as the Assad regime \u2014 and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon.",
      "Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank.",
      "Evidence of the Assad regime\u2019s sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added.",
      "Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection.",
      "The primary smuggling routes were Syria\u2019s porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products.",
      "Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe.",
      "The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project.",
      "\u201cSeeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,\u201d said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids.",
      "The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed \"the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.\u201d",
      "The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country.",
      "While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited.",
      "Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.",
      "Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on protesters.",
      "Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee.",
      "Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin\u2019s home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad\u2019s consent.",
      "Assad has turned Syria into \u201cthe largest Captagon factory in the world,\u201d HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus\u2019s Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. \u201cToday, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.\"",
      "While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say.",
      "\u201cLikely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,\u201d Rose said.",
      "They may also \u201cseek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should \u201cestablish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country\u2019s formal, licit economic sphere,\u201d Rose said."

      "A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England this summer has had not guilty pleas entered for him in court",
      "LONDON -- A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England this summer remained silent in court Wednesday as not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf.",
      "Axel Rudakubana, 18, who has refused to speak in each court appearance, was read the charges of three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaida manual.",
      "Justice Julian Goose ordered a clerk to enter the pleas in Liverpool Crown Court as Rudakubana stayed mum during a video appearance from a London prison where he is held.",
      "His trial is scheduled for Jan. 20.",
      "It was the first time in a court appearance that the teen did not pull his sweatshirt collar over his nose to obscure his face.",
      "He appeared to smile as an officer confirmed that the court proceeding could be heard at the prison. The judge noted that Rudakubana was not responding. He swayed from side to side as the charges were read and bent forward at one point.",
      "Rudakubana was charged in August with murdering three girls \u2014 Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6 \u2014 and stabbing 10 other people on July 29 in the seaside town of Southport in northern England.",
      "The attack at a small dance and yoga studio on the first day of summer vacation sparked rioting across England and Northern Ireland fueled by far-right activists that lasted a week.",
      "The violence, which injured more than 300 police officers and led to fiery attacks on hotels housing migrants, began after Rudakubana \u2014 then unnamed \u2013- was falsely identified as an asylum seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Wales to Rwandan immigrants.",
      "More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder that lasted a week and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison.",
      "A report released Wednesday was critical of police for failing to recognize the threat of violent disorder after a number of smaller incidents across the U.K. in the previous two years.",
      "The report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services said there were also lapses in gathering intelligence from social media and the dark web.",
      "Rudakubana was charged in October with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin, and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer.",
      "Police have said the stabbings have not been classified as acts of terrorism because the motive is not yet known.",

      "The killing of a senior Russian general in a bombing outside his apartment building in Moscow was the boldest assassination yet of a top military officer and again brought the war in Ukraine to the streets of the capital.",
      "Some things to know about the attack and who is suspected of being behind it:",
      "Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday morning by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter parked near the entrance of his apartment block in southeastern Moscow as he left for his office. Kirillov\u2019s assistant also died in the attack.",
      "The bomb was triggered remotely, according to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or FSB. The explosion was caught on video from a camera mounted inside a car, showing the men walking out of the building and the fiery blast.",
      "Kirillov, 54, was the chief of Russia's Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces. These special troops are tasked with protecting the military from the enemy\u2019s use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and ensuring operations in a contaminated environment.",
      "He was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing Kirillov of directing the use of banned chemical weapons.",
      "Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of using them.",
      "Kirillov, who took his post in 2017, was one of the highest profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances \u2014 claims Kyiv and its Western allies rejected as propaganda.",
      "His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack.",
      "An SBU official said Tuesday that the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a \u201cwar criminal and an entirely legitimate target.\u201d",
      "The SBU official provided the video of the bombing.",
      "The FSB said Wednesday it detained a suspect, described as a citizen of the Central Asian nation of Uzbekistan who was born in 1995. The Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies identified him as Akhmad Kurbanov.",
      "According to the FSB, the suspect said he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Associated Press could not confirm the conditions under which the suspect made the statement to the security services.",
      "The FSB said the suspect said he had been promised $100,000 and resettlement to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov.",
      "The agency said that acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he obtained a homemade bomb, placed it on an e-scooter and parked it at the entrance to Kirillov's apartment building.",
      "The suspect rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed the scene to his handlers in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, detonating the bomb when Kirillov left the building, the FSB said.",
      "The suspect faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the FSB said.",
      "Russian media reports said the FSB tracked the suspect by studying video from surveillance cameras and cellphone calls.",
      "The FSB has not said how the suspect was recruited. He was detained in a village in the Moscow region, Interior Ministry official Irina Volk told Tass.",
      "It is not known where he is being held or when he will appear in court. That is expected in the coming days, to hear the terms of his pre-trial detention. Under Russian law, a person may only be remanded in custody for 48 hours before a court order is made.",
      "Russian officials have described the bombing as a \u201cterrorist act.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday it was \u201cobvious\u201d that Ukraine was behind Kirillov\u2019s killing, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Kyiv \u201cdoes not shy away from terrorist methods.\u201d",
      "While President Vladimir Putin has not publicly spoken about the attack, Peskov said he expressed his condolences on Kirillov's death.",
      "Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, described the attack as an attempt by Kyiv to distract public attention from its military failures and vowed that its \u201csenior military-political leadership will face inevitable retribution.\u201d",
      "Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, called Kirillov \u201ca professional military man, an intellectual, a Russian patriot.\u201d",
      "He \u201cdid a lot to increase the effectiveness of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, to ensure the security and sovereignty of our country,\u201d Volodin said. \u2014-",

    "story": [
      "A released hostage in Gaza is fighting to save her boyfriend, who remains in captivity",
      "KIRYAT GAT, Israel -- Ilana Gritzewsky is fighting a battle against time to save her boyfriend from Hamas captivity.",
      "While there appears to be progress toward a deal to free the remaining captives in phases, Matan Zangauker would likely not be released in the first stage since he is a young man. Gritzewsky is terrified a deal could break down or he could die in captivity before he\u2019s freed.",
      "Gritzewsky knows first-hand the perils facing her boyfriend, who turned 25 on Wednesday. She was kidnapped and held hostage for 55 days before being released during the only previous ceasefire deal a year ago.",
      "\u201cAll the hostages need to get out,\u201d said Gritzewsky. \u201cIf we don\u2019t release all of the hostages \u2014 all the hostages in captivity \u2014 they will be dead.\u201d",
      "Many relatives of people held in Gaza find no reprieve in reports that negotiations toward a deal are progressing. The renewed ceasefire talks are just the latest twist in what\u2019s been more than 14 months of anguish, despair and uncertainty about their loved ones\u2019 fates. Still, they dedicate themselves to lobbying for their loved ones\u2019 freedom, even as the world moves on to other crises.",
      "\u201cI gave my promise to my friends from the kibbutz in the tunnels before I went home. I told them I will do everything, everything I have to, to take them out from that hell. And I ask all the time: Am I doing everything I can?\u201d said Gritzewsky, 31.",
      "Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting roughly 250, dragging them into Gaza. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of Gaza. More than 45,000 people have been killed in the ongoing war, according to local health authorities, who say more than half are women and children but do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count.",
      "About 100 hostages were freed in a brief truce in November 2023, while others have been rescued or their bodies have been retrieved by the Israeli military. Around another 100 have not been released, though Israel believes at least a third of them are dead.",
      "In the deal under discussion, mostly women and older people are expected to be freed in the first six-to-eight-week phase, but many families of hostages are lobbying for all of the hostages to be freed at once.",
      "Zangauker and Gritzewsky were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where they lived together, and then held separately in Gaza. Just before her release from a tunnel under Gaza, Gritzewsky heard from other hostages that Zangauker was nearby. She begged to be able to see him but was not allowed.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hamas released a video of Zangauker, filmed under duress, where he described difficult conditions in Gaza and pleaded with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike a deal to end the war.",
      "\u201cHe spoke quietly, but his eyes were screaming for help,\u201d Gritzewsky said of the footage.",
      "While it was a relief to see Zangauker, the video is no guarantee that he\u2019s still alive today, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a photo. I don\u2019t want a video. I want him here. I want all the hostages here,\u201d she said.",
      "The video brought back some of the worst memories of her captivity: the middle of the night interrogations, the filthy conditions, the lack of medical help for the injuries she suffered during the kidnapping. Gritzewsky's pelvis and jaw were broken and she has burns on her legs. She suffered hearing loss in one ear.",
      "\u201cWhat they are going through is physically, psychologically, and emotionally torture, day and night,\u201d said Gritzewsky, wearing a hat that belonged to Zangauker that she rescued from their destroyed home. \u201cI know the psychology that they use, how you don\u2019t have water, how you don\u2019t have food, how you don\u2019t see the light, you don\u2019t know what day or hour it is.\u201d",
      "Gritzewsky said she hates being in front of the cameras, telling her story over and over, reliving the worst days of her life, in a desperate attempt to raise awareness of the plight of the hostages and bring her boyfriend home.",
      "Nonetheless, Gritzewsky has been a constant presence at protests and demonstrations across the country along with Zangauker\u2019s mother, who has emerged as one of the most vocal activists for the hostages.",
      "Einav Zangauker, who used to support Netanyahu, has virulently opposed his handling of the war and is furious at the government for not yet reaching a ceasefire deal, accusing it of forsaking the hostages in its bid to topple Hamas.",
      "Netanyahu has said that the war must continue until Hamas is crushed and unable to rearm, but critics point out that Israel has already assassinated the top leadership and destroyed large swaths of Gaza.",
      "Einav Zangauker, a single mother, has been relentless in her crusade, attending demonstrations daily, speaking repeatedly to every major Israeli media outlet, and even climbing into a cage that was hoisted high above a protest to hammer home the idea of her son in captivity.",
      "She has demanded that politicians pursue a ceasefire that will release all the hostages at once.",
      "\u201cIf my son returns in a body bag or body parts, I will not put you on trial, I will take the law into my own hands!\u201d she screamed at lawmakers during a parliamentary committee meeting Monday.",
      "While Gritzewsky is no longer captive in Gaza, she said she can\u2019t begin to heal until the hostages, including her boyfriend, come home.",
      "\u201cSince Oct. 7, it\u2019s like time stopped,\" she said. \"You see the world running in front of your eyes, but your life is crushed like little pieces of dust.\u201d",

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni is defending her friendship with U.S. tech billionaire and Trump advisor Elon Musk",
      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday defended her friendship with U.S. tech billionaire and Trump confidant Elon Musk, telling Italian lawmakers that she would not be influenced in areas where he has economic interests.",
      "\u201cI can be a friend of Elon Musk and at the same time the head of the first Italian government that made a new law to regulate private activity in space,\u2019\u2019 she said, responding to questions during a customary parliamentary discussion ahead of a European Union summit in Brussels this week.",
      "Meloni has met frequently with the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire since her far-right-led government came to power in 2022, keen to bring investments in Italy. Meloni\u2019s government this summer approved a framework for foreign space companies to operate in Italy, which is expected to generate 7.3 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in investments by 2026.",
      "Taking a swipe at her predecessors, she said previous Italian leaders \u201cwho thought they had a good relationship, even a friendship, with a foreign leader, they had to slavishly follow what the others did.\u201d",
      "Meloni added that she had good relationships \u201cwith many people\" but \u201cI don\u2019t take orders from anyone.\u201d",
      "Meloni and Musk\u2019s friendship has attracted attention in the past. Musk denied a romantic relationship last September after a photo of them looking fondly at each other went viral. The two were at a black-tie event in New York where Musk had presented Meloni with an award.",
      "Musk appeared a year ago at an event for youth members of Meloni\u2019s party in Italy. More recently, he took to social media platform X, which he controls, to attack an Italian court decision that has stymied Meloni\u2019s plans to vet migrants rescued at sea in Albania. Musk's comments drew a strong rebuke from Italy's president."

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group, said in a statement that Tortoise Media is purchasing The Observer through a combination of cash and shares.",
      "The Observer, which was founded in 1791 and became part of the Guardian Media Group in 1993, is a bastion of liberal values in Britain\u2019s media landscape. Tortoise has promised readers that it will honor the paper's historic values.",
      "Tortoise was launched in 2019 by James Harding, a former editor of the London Times and director of news at the BBC, and the former U.S. ambassador to London, Matthew Barzun.",
      "\u201cThe Observer has a historic place in the world of journalism and a special place in the heart of its readers,\u201d said Harding. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to put all we have into making sure its values, interests and passions reach even more people in the many years to come.\u201d",
      "As part of the deal, Tortoise has agreed a five-year commercial agreement with GMG, which will see it pay for both print and distribution services, as well as marketing through the Guardian.",
      "The Scott Trust will also take a 9% stake in Tortoise Media and commit 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) into Tortoise Media as part of the 25 million-pound investment, much of which will be focused on establishing The Observer\u2019s own digital identity \u2014 currently its online presence is very much secondary to that of the Guardian's.",
      "\u201cThis deal secures fresh investment and ideas for the Observer that will take the title to new audiences and enhance the role liberal journalism plays in our society,\" said Ole Jacob Sunde, chair of the Scott Trust.",

      "It was also announced that Lucy Rock has been appointed the print editor of the Observer, the first woman to oversee the newspaper in 100 years. She will work alongside a digital editor, as the Observer builds its own online brand. Rock will report to Harding, who will be editor-in-chief.",
      "The proposed sale has been opposed by journalists across the Guardian Media Group, culminating in a 48-hour strike earlier this month.",
      "Tortoise has committed to meet all the key employment terms for any members of staff, as well as freelancers and contributors, who wish to continue to work on The Observer.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:06:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The world&rsquo;s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles says it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year",
    "story": [
      "The world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles says it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year",
      "XIAMEN, China -- The world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles said Wednesday it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year.",
      "The idea behind battery swapping is to refuel quickly, similar to filling a conventional car with gas. Instead of waiting for the batteries to recharge, one swaps out the old ones with a block of fresh ones at a swap station. An EV driver pulls into a swapping station, and automated technology exchanges the low battery for a fully-charged one the station has available.",
      "China-based CATL announced plans to open 1,000 swap stations next year in China, including in Hong Kong and Macao, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stations built with partners. If the company follows through, it could rival Nio, a 10-year-old Chinese electric car brand that has opened more than 2,700 stations and has plans for at least 5,000.",
      "Nothing on that scale exists elsewhere in the world, though Nio has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe. Such a large investment is possible in China, where government support has transformed the world's largest auto market into a heavily electric one and made the country a leader in EV technology.",
      "\u201cBy 2030, battery swapping, home charging, and public charging stations will share the market,\u201d Robin Zeng, the CEO of CATL, predicted at a splashy presentation in southeast China's Fujian province, where CATL is based. He appealed to corporate partners to work together to \"build more convenient, more economical and safer services for customers, promoting a brand-new way of life.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping faces hurdles. It requires a standardization of the battery pack so the swap stations can handle it, and most EVs have their own configuration. An electric vehicle has to be equipped with the right technology in order to use a battery swapping station, and not many EV models around the world currently allow for swapping.",
      "Conversely, an electric car can use any charging station in China because all use a common plug, and fast-charging technology is reducing the time for a recharge.",
      "Jing Yang, a Fitch Ratings director who focuses on China\u2019s auto and renewable energy sectors, said automakers may be concerned that adopting a standard battery pack could cede too much control of their supply chain to others.",
      "Electric car manufacturers have many changing specifications to stay on top of and invest in as the EV market evolves, making new technology a hard sell. It is difficult to get automakers to buy into less feasible infrastructure if EV adoption in a region is still relatively low.",
      "But some may want to test the waters to see if battery swapping can improve sales, and doing so with CATL or Nio could reduce the cost, she said. That's because a driver wouldn't have to own the battery, which is currently the most expensive part of an EV.",
      "China auto market analyst Lei Xing believes that swapping can complement the country's well-developed charging network. \u201cI don\u2019t see it becoming mainstream, but I do see it becoming a key part of that infrastructure landscape,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Davidson, a renewable energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, believes that charging will dominate \"and maybe there\u2019ll be some battery swapping options mixed in there.\u201d",
      "The concept has proven easier to implement with fleet vehicles \u2014 taxis, buses and commercial trucks \u2014 that have a standard model and, in some cases, stick to set routes. CATL, which launched a small pilot project two years ago aimed at taxis, will start its rollout with fleets and expand to individual car owners later, said Zhang Kai, the deputy president of CATL's battery swapping subsidiary.",
      "Swapping is still faster than fast-charging. The CATL station, branded EVOGO, can change a battery pack in 100 seconds, said Yang Jun, the CEO of the subsidiary. Time is money for taxi and truck drivers, Lei said.",
      "Wang Wubing, a driver at China\u2019s popular Didi ride-hailing service, said at an EVOGO station in the city of Xiamen that he swaps batteries to save time so he can pick up more customers. But it is more expensive than charging.",
      "In the U.S., battery swapping made headlines nearly two decades ago with the startup Better Place, which later shut down. Now, companies such as Ample have reinvented the technology, also starting with the ride-hailing market. Uber and Lyft drivers that own electric cars want to spend time on the road and earning money instead of waiting even for the fastest EV charge. Ample says its swaps take just 5 minutes.",
      "Both CATL and Nio have announced agreements with automakers to use their swap stations. The question is whether enough automakers and drivers adopt it to raise use of the stations to a profitable level.",

      "Court documents show an estimated total of 2,683,345.88 pounds (about $3.4 million) is held in the seven accounts police can now seize.",
      "Devon and Cornwall Police said after the ruling that \"from the outset, we have aimed to demonstrate that Andrew and Tristan Tate evaded taxes and laundered money through bank accounts located in Devon,\" a county in southwest England.

Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",

    "story": [
      "A report by CNN's Clarissa Ward about a freed Syrian prisoner provided some dramatic scenes, but the network has since found that it apparently wasn't all that it appeared",
      "CNN is acknowledging that a gripping story it aired last week depicting a Syrian man being let free from a Damascus prison after the fall of dictator Bashar Assad's regime was not what it seemed.",
      "The network said that it has since found out that the man shown in correspondent Clarissa Ward's report, which initially aired on Dec. 11, apparently gave a false identity.",
      "\u201cThis moment captures the complexity of the situation in Syria,\u201d CNN's Jake Tapper said on Tuesday.",
      "In the report, Ward was being escorted by a Syrian rebel through a prison that had been run by the Syrian Air Force intelligence services and emptied since the Assad government fell. That's what they thought, at least \u2014 until they came upon a padlocked door.",
      "The rebel guard shot the lock to open the door to a cell, where they found a man hiding under a blanket. Clearly bewildered and shaking, he gulped water when offered, said \u201coh, God, there is light!\u201d when led outdoors and hugged the guard when told of the change in power.",
      "He told Ward that his name was Adel Ghurbal from the Syrian city of Homs, and that he was a civilian who had been arrested three months ago and spent time in three different prisons.",
      "But a few days later, a Syrian fact-checking site, Verify-Sy, said that the man was really Salama Mohammad Salama, and that he was a former intelligence officer for the Assad government. CNN obtained a photo of Salama and, through facial recognition software, found that it was a better than 99 percent chance that was the same man from their report, the network said.",
      "Ward said Tuesday that CNN didn't know why he had been arrested. Verify-Sy reported that Salama, who had a reputation for extortion, had been thrown in prison because of a dispute with a superior officer over sharing some of the profits, she said. CNN has been unable to confirm that or locate Salama, she said.",
      "A CNN spokeswoman said that no one outside of the network knew ahead of time of the plans to visit the prison. CNN reported the scene as it unfolded, the network said.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 15:06:27 -0500",
    "summary": "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
    "story": [
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",

I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture.

      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday that would permanently give tax relief on tips and cars, measures that his Republican administration has said would give money back to middle- and lower-income workers",
      "RICHMOND -- Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday to provide tax relief on tips and cars, measures his Republican administration touted as giving money back to middle- and lower-income workers.",
      "The proposal, which would amend the final year of the state's two-year budget cycle, also seeks to boost funding for schools, maternal health and disaster relief. An adviser for Youngkin said ahead of his speech that the proposed adjustments are fueled by surplus funds coming out of fiscal year 2024.",
      "\u201cWe reopened Virginia\u2019s economy after a global pandemic, all while delivering surplus after surplus after surplus,\u201d Youngkin said in a presentation to the General Assembly\u2019s money committees. \"And as a result of our work together, Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading and Virginia is winning.\u201d",
      "Budget plans introduced by governors typically undergo revisions by the money committees before lawmakers vote. And with Democrats poised to keep control of both General Assembly chambers after special elections in January, Youngkin's priorities may likely be contingent on bipartisanship.",
      "Democratic House of Appropriations Chair Luke Torian said on Wednesday that none of Youngkin's proposed amendments were off the table, clarifying that the state had roughly $2 billion to $3 billion in surplus funds. He also said that the state would have to be strategic in its spending, particularly if its economy takes a dip in years to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll go over the governor\u2019s presentation and we\u2019ll see what is applicable \u2014 what we can do, what we can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.",
      "Youngkin said $1.1 billion could be deposited into a car tax relief fund from the state's surplus, which would pre-fund its first three years. In his speech, he envisioned a permanent, refundable income tax credit of up to $150 for people earning under $50,000 a year, and up to $300 for joint filers making under $100,000 annually.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea: the local car tax,\u201d he said.",
      "He also pushed for Virginia to eliminate taxes on tips, which would make the Old Dominion the first state in the U.S. to take such action. Youngkin argued the proposal would save $70 million, though some Democrats questioned whether such fiduciary relief would be feasible.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that I read the legislation, there was no definition really, of what tips are, given that this is ground that hasn\u2019t been plowed before,\u201d Democratic Del. Vivian Watts said in the joint committee meeting. \u201dI look forward to a discussion before we act on any such legislation of how we define tips.\"",
      "Echoing nationwide concerns surrounding immigration, Youngkin emphasized he would also like to cut off funds toward local entities that do not fully comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 an initiative he said would weed out sanctuary cities.",
      "In his speech, Youngkin said local law enforcement, sheriffs and jail directors should be required to notify federal authorities of migrants\u2019 arrest 48 hours before their release. His proposal comes after the governor has gone on national news networks, lamenting illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cThis should be common sense. I don\u2019t think anybody wants an illegal immigrant who has committed a serious and violent crime to be released back in the community,\u201d Youngkin said.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s proposal to deny funds to jurisdictions that ignore immigration detainers would likely be held up by Democrats. But as lawmakers roll into an election year in 2025, immigration may be a key issue to voters across the state.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:34:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u2019s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses.",
      "But with inflation pressures still elevated and with concern that President-elect Donald Trump's policies could fuel inflation, the Fed indicated Wednesday that it's likely to cut rates more gradually in 2025 than it had projected three months ago. The policymakers now envision two rate cuts next year, not the four they predicted back in September.",
      "The result is that borrowers who have been hoping for much-lower-rate loans could be disappointed. Loan rates may barely budge if the Fed sticks with its plan to cut its key short-term rate only twice next year.",
      "\u201cThis could be the last cut for a while,\u201d said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. \u201cBecause the upcoming Trump administration\u2019s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting.\u201d",
      "Depending on the specific proposals the Trump administration manages to enact, the Fed could hold off on any additional cuts until March or even later.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cAnother rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t amount to much for those with debt,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cA quarter-point reduction may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that the best thing cardholders can do in 2025 is to take matters into their own hands when it comes to high interest rates.\u201d",
      "The average annual percentage rate on a new credit card offer, according to LendingTree, is 24.43%. In September, it was 24.92%. Further modest declines in that rate, Schulz said, are possible in the next few months.",
      "But, he cautioned, \u201cAnyone expecting card rates to go from awful to amazing overnight because of the Fed is going to be sorely disappointed.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said that particularly for credit card users who carry debt from month to month, \u201cIt\u2019s a drop in the bucket for anyone feeling pressure from high rates.\u201d",
      "For savers, returns on high-yield accounts have dropped, too, in tandem with the Fed's rate cuts. So while these accounts are not quite as attractive as they had been, they might still be worth investigating if you haven\u2019t shopped for one recently. Some of these accounts offer yields at or near 5%.",
      "\u201cYes, you\u2019ve missed the peak rates seen a few months ago,\" Schulz said. \u201cBut even at these levels, they\u2019re still likely higher than what you\u2019ll find at a traditional bank.\u201d",
      "Though the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, it does influence them. Long-term mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is driven in part by the market's outlook for inflation and the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "That means that, at least indirectly, cuts to the Fed\u2019s key rate can put downward pressure on mortgage rates, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.",
      "\u201cCase in point, turmoil in the bond market has caused mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down over the last month,\u201d Channel said. \u201cAfter peaking at 6.84% for the week ending Nov. 21, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has since come down to 6.60%.\u201d",
      "Despite this decline, this average remains well above the 2024 low of 6.08%, back in late September.",
      "For people with fixed mortgages, their rate won\u2019t change unless they refinance their mortgage or sell and move someplace else.",
      "The effects of the Fed\u2019s half-point rate cut in September and its quarter-point cut in November have largely been passed through to auto loans, which fell on average from a peak of 7.3% in July to 6.8% last month, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com.",
      "The half-point drop, he said, has helped more people afford new vehicles, helping to spur a buying spree in November. But the increased demand, which Drury attributed largely to some optimism over Trump's election, also boosted average prices and monthly payments to record levels.",
      "\u201cOptimism and having money on hand to do these things has definitely green-lit some people\u2019s spending, when other folks are more conservative with how much they\u2019re spending,\u201d he said.",
      "The average amount that a car buyer financed rose to $42,160, and average monthly payments hit $753, according to Edmunds data.",
      "Edmunds expects only a modest increase in auto sales next year, from just under 16 million vehicles this year to 16.2 million in 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee is in a balancing act \u2014 cut (rates) too much and risk inflation resurgence; cut too little and continue to squeeze the labor market,\" said Renter of NerdWallet.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reiterating \u201cthe familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut \u2018skip\u2019 at the January meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will favor a gradual easing of policy to observe how the economy and inflation behave, indicating an extremely \u2018data-dependent\u2019 approach,\u201d Daco said.",
      "\u201cRemember,\" Channel said, \u201cthe Fed is designed to pivot relatively quickly should something unexpected happen. If the economy shows serious signs of deterioration, we could see bigger and more frequent cuts over the next 12 months.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, he cautioned, \"if inflation rears its head and spikes once more, (rate) cuts might be moved off the table.\u201d",

      "Republicans will still be in charge when the Wisconsin Legislature returns to work in January but will have the narrowest majorities in years",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- When the Wisconsin Legislature returns to work in January, Republicans will still be in charge but will have the narrowest majorities since taking control in 2011. That's giving Democrats, including Gov. Tony Evers, optimism that both sides will be able to work together better than they have since Evers took office six years ago.",
      "Both sides are eyeing the state's massive budget surplus, which sits at more than $4 billion. What to do with that money will drive debate over the next two-year budget, which will be written in 2025, while questions hang in the air about whether Evers plans to run for a third term in 2026 and how the state will interact with President-elect Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Here is a look at some of the biggest pending issues:",
      "Democrats gained seats in the November election because of redrawn maps ordered by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The Republican majority now sits at 54-45 in the Assembly and 18-15 in the Senate. Democrats have 10 more seats in the Assembly than last session and four more in the Senate and are hopeful about gaining the majority after the 2026 election.",
      "\u201cWe have already seen a shift in the Capitol due to the new maps,\u201d Assembly Democratic Minority Leader Great Neubauer told The Associated Press.",
      "She and other Democrats predict it will lead to more pressure from rank-and-file Republicans in competitive districts to move to the middle and compromise with Democrats.",
      "\u201cEverybody understands, at least at this point, that we we need to work together, pull together,\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu told the AP. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to get some things done.\u201d",
      "Democrats say they have been talking with Evers and Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul about how Wisconsin can push back against the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass deportations. But Democrats say they are also looking at other ways the state can fight Trump\u2019s policies on issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried about a lot of the things that former and future President Trump might do, especially when it comes to deportation and immigration,\" Senate Democratic Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein said.",
      "Republicans passed a $3.5 billion tax cut that Evers gutted to just $175 million with his veto in the last budget. With another large surplus, Republicans say they want to try again.",
      "\u201cPeople struggling to pay their bills,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cWe heard that in our local races. And so we want to help help help families out there. We have the money to do it. And that\u2019s going to be our number one priority.\u201d",
      "He said he would like a tax cut of around $2 billion.",
      "Democrats say that they aren't opposed to cutting taxes, but that they want it to be targeted to helping the middle and lower classes and families.",
      "\u201cWe are not interested in tax cuts that primarily benefit rich Wisconsinites or corporations,\u201d Neubauer said. \u201cBut we are certainly open to tax cuts that help those who are struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "The state superintendent of schools, Jill Underly, proposed spending more than $4 billion on K-12 schools in her budget proposal, which is subject to legislative approval. That's almost certainly not going to happen, both Republicans and Democrats said.",
      "\u201cWe're not going to spend $4 billion on education, I can guarantee you that right now,\u201d LeMahieu said.",
      "While Democrats say they are prioritizing education funding, \u201cI don't think we're going to be able to match that,\u201d Hesselbein said of the $4 billion request.",
      "Leaders of the cash-strapped Universities of Wisconsin have asked for $855 million in additional funding in the next budget, nearly an 11% increase. System President Jay Rothman says schools need the money to stave off tuition increases, cover raises, subsidize tuition, and keep two-year branch campuses open in the face of declining enrollment and flat state aid.",
      "Evers has promised to include the request in his budget, but Republican leaders said they would not approve that much, and Democrats also said it was a goal that was unlikely to be met.",
      "LeMahieu said the university needs to rethink spending levels in the face of declining enrollment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see some substantial change in how they\u2019re doing their programing,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep spending more and more on a system that\u2019s educating less and less people.\u201d",
      "Democrats say they will continue to push for ways to expand and reduce costs for child care, health care for new mothers and prescription drugs. Both Republicans and Democrats say they want to do more to create affordable housing. The future of the state's land stewardship program also hangs in in the balance after the state Supreme Court said Republicans were illegally blocking funding of projects.",
      "Democrats also say they hope to revive efforts to legalize medical marijuana, an effort that was backed by some Republicans but that failed to pass last session.",
      "LeMahieu predicted the slimmer Republican majorities will make it more difficult for any marijuana bill to pass because some lawmakers \u201care dead set against it.\u201d"

      "MIAMI -- A federal grand jury in Washington has returned an indictment against former Congressman David Rivera for failing to register as a foreign agent of a sanctioned Venezuelan media tycoon on whose behalf the Miami Republican allegedly lobbied the Trump administration.",
      "The indictment is the second set of criminal charges to examine Rivera's relationship with Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a billionaire businessman charged in 2018 and again in 2024 with bribing senior Venezuelan officials in corrupt deals to embezzle state funds from Nicolas Maduro's administration.",
      "The indictment unsealed on Wednesday alleges that Rivera, between June 2019 and April 2020, lobbied U.S. officials, including an unnamed senior official in the executive branch, to remove sanctions against Gorr\u00edn.",
      "Rivera was allegedly aided in that effort by another unnamed former U.S. official and resident of New York, who he allegedly paid $125,000 from the over $5.5 million he received from Gorr\u00edn or on his behalf, prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department's National Security Division said.",
      "Rivera was charged with money laundering and failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as required when lobbying U.S. officials on behalf of foreign individuals and companies.",
      "To promote his criminal activities, Rivera allegedly created fake shell companies registered in Delaware using names associated with a law firm and with the unnamed official, as well as the official's hometown, to give the false appearance that the shell companies were legitimate, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said the official was unaware the companies were using his or her name and hometown.",
      "Ed Shohat, a Miami defense attorney who represents Rivera, declined to comment, saying he hadn't had time to discuss the indictment with his client.",
      "Rivera was arrested in 2022 in another illegal lobbying case, out of federal court in Miami, tied to a $50 million consulting contract his firm, Interamerican Consulting, signed with a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA. Prosecutors say the 2017 contract was a ruse to hide a secret campaign by Maduro's government to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The Maduro outreach, facilitated by Trump's current incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles when she worked as a Washington lobbyist on behalf of Gorr\u00edn's TV network Globovision, ultimately failed. In 2019, Trump recognized opposition lawmaker Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader and imposed stiff oil sanctions on the OPEC nation in a bid to unseat Maduro.",
      "But before the charm offensive unraveled, Gorr\u00edn, with the help of Rivera and others, managed to get his photo taken shaking hands with then-Vice President Mike Pence at an event in Florida. Rivera and Gorr\u00edn also met with Trump's pick to become Secretary of State, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who was once Rivera's roommate when both were state lawmakers in Tallahassee.",
      "Rivera also looked to set up a possible flight and meeting on Gorr\u00edn's jet for a female campaign adviser turned White House \u201ccounselor\u201d on June 27, 2017, according to court records in the earlier criminal complaint and a parallel lawsuit filed against Rivera by Maduro\u2019s opponents who now control the U.S. subsidiary of PDVSA. That same day Trump aide Kellyanne Conway was in Miami for a fundraising dinner with Miami Republicans.",
      "Conway did not immediately return an email and text message seeking comment about Rivera's latest indictment.",
      "Rivera also roped in Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas to try and set up a meeting for Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister with executives from Exxon, which was headquartered in Sessions\u2019 district at the time.",
      "Rivera, who served in Congress from 2011 to 2013, has been embroiled in several election-related controversies, including orchestrating the stealth funding of an unknown Democratic candidate to take on his main rival in a South Florida congressional race and a state investigation into whether he hid a $1 million contract with a gambling company. That probe also involved possible misuse of campaign funds to pay for state House activities already reimbursed by the state.",
      "He has denied any illegal lobbying on behalf of Venezuela's government and has countersued Maduro's opponents in federal court."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments next month over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok in the United States if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell it.",
      "The justices will hear arguments Jan. 10 about whether the law impermissibly restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The law, enacted in April, set a Jan. 19 deadline for TikTok to be sold or else face a ban in the United States. The popular social media platform has more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "It's unclear how quickly a decision might come. But the high court still could act after the arguments to keep the law from taking effect pending a final ruling, if at least five of the nine justices think it's unconstitutional.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance had urged the justices to step in before Jan. 19. The high court also will hear arguments from content creators who rely on the platform for income and some TikTok users.",
      "The timing of the arguments means that the outgoing Biden administration's Justice Department will make the case in defense of the law that passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed by Democratic President Joe Biden in April.",
      "The incoming Republican administration might not have the same view of the law.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d has said his administration would take a look at the situation. Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Monday.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case pits free speech rights against the government\u2019s stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\u201d TikTok spokesman Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "Free-speech advocates also praised the court's decision to step in.",
      "The government should not be able to restrict speech \u201cwithout proving with evidence that the tools are presently seriously harmful. But in this case, Congress has required and the DC Circuit approved TikTok\u2019s forced divestiture based only upon fears of future potential harm. This greatly lowers well-established standards for restricting freedom of speech in the U.S.,\u201d David Greene, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement.",
      "A panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the law on Dec. 6, then denied an emergency plea to delay the law's implementation.",
      "Without court action, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump\u2019s Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law is supposed to go into effect."

      "The U.S. market gained more than 25% for the year to date through mid-December 2024",
      "The U.S. market gained more than 25% for the year to date through mid-December 2024. That\u2019s a healthy showing by any measure. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would be a market environment that\u2019s conducive to tax-loss selling.",
      "But unless your strategy is to buy only U.S. stocks, you may indeed have opportunities to realize tax losses in your portfolio, which you can use to offset gains elsewhere. That\u2019s because other market segments haven\u2019t performed nearly as well.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that tax-loss selling is only a worthwhile strategy if you have taxable accounts. To benefit from a tax loss that in turn can help you save on taxes, you need to find holdings in your taxable portfolio that are trading below your cost basis \u2014 your purchase price adjusted upward to account for any commissions that you paid along with reinvested dividend and capital gains distributions.",
      "There are different methods for determining cost basis. The specific share identification method for cost-basis elections provides the most opportunities for tax-loss selling or gain harvesting because it allows you to cherry-pick specific lots of a security to sell. But it\u2019s important to note that the average cost basis is usually the cost-basis election default for mutual funds, while the default cost basis election for individual stocks is often first in, first out. In other words, unless you select a different cost-basis election before selling, your investment firm will report your loss or gain using the default.",
      "If you sell securities and your sale price is lower than your cost basis, you have a capital loss. That loss, in turn, can help offset taxable gains elsewhere in your portfolio. (With\u202fmany mutual funds again poised to make big capital gains distributions in 2024, those losses could come in handy.) If you don\u2019t have any gains in the year you realize the losses or your losses exceed your gains, you can use the losses to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income. Unused losses can be carried forward indefinitely and applied against future taxable gains.",
      "As 2024 winds down, here are some of the most fruitful spots to look for tax-loss candidates.",
      "Long-term bond funds and ETFs:\u202fDespite the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate cuts, many bond funds are still in the red over the past year and over the past three years as well. Long-term bonds and bond funds look especially ripe for tax-loss selling. Losses in intermediate-term bonds haven\u2019t been as deep \u2014 2% annualized losses over the past three years \u2014 but still could add up to a decent-sized loss if your position size is large. Moreover, tax-loss selling may provide a hook to improve your total portfolio\u2019s asset location, in that fixed-income holdings are often best situated in tax-sheltered accounts rather than taxable ones. With yields surging, being smart about asset placement now matters more than it did when yields were exceptionally low.",
      "Individual stocks: Individual stock investors have the easiest pickings when it comes to unearthing tax-loss sales. Even if your portfolio has performed well in aggregate, it\u2019s likely that something you own has lost value since you purchased it. For the year to date through mid-November, about 1,100 US stocks with market caps of more than $1 billion had losses of 10% or more. You may even be seeing red on positions you\u2019ve owned for a while: Roughly 1,200 individual US companies with market caps of more than $1 billion had 10% or greater losses over the past three years.",
      "Other places in your portfolio to look are non-US stock funds, sector funds and short and alternative funds. For the latter, it\u2019s no surprise that investors who own funds and ETFs that bet against stocks have struggled recently, given the strength of stocks\u2019 gains this year.",
      "If you sell a security for a loss, you can go ahead and replace it with something similar right away, provided the new holding isn\u2019t so close that the IRS considers it \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d Immediately replacing an actively managed fund with an index fund or ETF would be fine, for example. But swapping an index fund for an ETF that tracks that same index would run afoul of the wash-sale rule, in that they\u2019re substantially identical securities. In that instance, the IRS would disallow the loss. And if you wait 30 days after selling the losing security, you can replace it with the very same security and still claim the loss.",
      "You should also consider tying tax-loss selling along with a broader portfolio review and cleanup effort.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has granted two requests from California to enforce strict standards for vehicle emissions, including a rule aimed at banning sales of new gasoline-powered cars in the state by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday granted two requests from California to enforce strict standards for vehicle emissions, including a rule aimed at banning sales of new gasoline-powered cars in the state by 2035. The incoming Trump administration is likely to try to reverse the action.",
      "The California rule is stricter than a federal rule adopted this year that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "EPA said its review found that opponents of the two waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the federal Clean Air Act.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has longstanding authority to request waivers from EPA to protect its residents from dangerous air pollution coming from mobile sources like cars and trucks,\u201d EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s actions follow through on EPA\u2019s commitment to partner with states to reduce emissions and act on the threat of climate change.\u201d",
      "The new waiver is important not only to California but to more than a dozen other states that follow its nation-leading standards on vehicle emissions.",
      "Even so, the waiver is likely to be short-lived. President-elect Donald Trump has said he will move to revoke all California waivers as part of an industry-friendly approach that includes boosting production of fossil fuels and repealing key parts of a landmark 2022 climate law.",
      "Trump rescinded California's authority on emissions in 2019,  only to be reversed three years later by the Biden EPA, which restored the state\u2019s authority in 2022.",
      "Any effort by the new administration is likely to spawn a new set of legal challenges that could delay any action.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who often touts California's leadership on climate policy, said EPA's approval of the advanced clean-cars rule was a vote of confidence in California's accomplishments in \u201cprotecting our people by cleaning our air and cutting pollution.\u201d",
      "\u201cNaysayers like President-elect Trump would prefer to side with the oil industry over consumers and American automakers, but California will continue fostering new innovations in the market,\" Newsom said.",
      "Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and other major automakers are meeting current California emission standards, but some major car companies questioned the latest EPA waiver.",
      "Most of the Democratic-leaning states that have adopted California\u2019s rules \u2014 clustered along the West Coast and in the Northeast \u2014 are not selling anywhere near the 35% level of EV sales required next year and are unlikely to meet the 2035 target of 100% EV sales, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a large industry group.",
      "\u201cAchieving the sales mandates under current market realities will take a miracle. There needs to be balance and some states should exit the (California) program,'' said John Bozzella, the group's CEO.",
      "Automakers are producing electric vehicles, Bozzella said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a huge gap between these EV sales mandates and a customer\u2019s reasonable expectation they can still choose what kind of vehicle to drive.\" He expects Trump to revoke the California waiver next year.",
      "Scott Vazin, a spokesman for Toyota in North America, said approval of the California waiver \u201cwill distort the auto industry as companies funnel zero-emission vehicles to the states that have adopted California\u2019s rules.\" If a customer in a state that follows California can't afford an EV \u201cor it doesn\u2019t meet their needs, there may not be a non-electric vehicle on the lot to purchase for their mobility needs,'' Vazin said.",
      "Environmental groups hailed the Biden administration's action.",
      "\u201cEPA\u2019s approval is a critical step forward in protecting our lungs from pollution and our wallets from the expenses of combustion fuels,\u201d said Paul Cort, director of Earthjustice\u2019s Right To Zero campaign. \u201cThe gradual shift in car sales to zero-emissions models will cut smog and household costs while growing California\u2019s clean energy workforce.\"",
      "Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the decision shows respect for California and other states.",
      "\u201cCalifornia decided that transitioning to cleaner, zero-emission vehicles is the best way to address the unique (air pollution) burdens it faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is exactly how our system of federalism should work. If other states don\u2019t like California\u2019s approach, they don\u2019t need to follow it. But no one should object to the longstanding authority of states to act to protect their residents.\u201d",
      "The EPA's action comes as the Supreme Court said last week that it will take up a business-backed appeal challenging an earlier California waiver issued by the Biden administration. The justices agreed to hear an appeal filed by fuel producers who object to an EPA waiver granted in 2022.",
      "The high court will not be reviewing the waiver itself but a related issue: whether fuel producers have legal standing to challenge it. A federal appeals court ruled that the companies lacked the right to sue because they produced no evidence that they would be affected by the waiver, which directly affects vehicle manufacturers.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really the launch on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms that allow these characters or animals to blow up like crazy,\u201d said Richard Derr, who has owned a Learning Express Toys franchise in Lake Zurich, Ill., for nearly 30 years and is also a regional manager for the specialty toy store chain.",
      "Social media is also speeding up the cycle. Must-have animals may only last a season before something new captures customers\u2019 imaginations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep feeding that beast,\u201d Juli Lennett, a vice president and toy industry advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cIf you are an influencer, you\u2019re not going to talk about last year\u2019s stuff.\u201d",
      "Skyrocketing plush toy sales \u2013 fueled by a need for comfort during the pandemic \u2013 are also increasing the demand for new and interesting varieties, Lennett said. In the first nine months of this year, sales of plush animals were up 115% from the same period in 2019, she said. Overall toy sales rose 38% in that time.",
      "Consumers are seeking out increasingly exotic species that they see in online videos, games and movies. Highland cows, red pandas and axolotls, a type of salamander native to Mexico, have all popped up in popular culture. According to Google Trends, searches for axolotls shot up in June 2021 after Minecraft added them to its game.",
      "\u201cNobody knew what an axolotl was in 2020,\u201d Derr said. \u201cNow, everybody knows axolotls.\u201d",
      "Cassandra Clayton, a Vermont Teddy Bear Company product designer, said rising sales to adults are also fueling the demand for unique \u2013 and collectible \u2013 plush toys.",
      "\u201cStuffed animals are really becoming an ageless item,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially with the boom of self-care in adults and turning towards comfort objects to help de-stress and relax in your life.\u201d",
      "Clayton expects demand for unusual stuffed animals to continue to grow. Among the oddest she has seen: a stuffed version of a water bear, a type of microorganism also known as a moss piglet or a tardigrade.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily inspire you to cuddle with them, but you\u2019re really seeing the industry start turning towards those characters,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the next trend.\u201d",
      "Figuring out the next \u201cit\u201d animal \u2013 or microorganism -- is a challenge for toy makers.",
      "\u201cYou never know exactly when they\u2019re going to hit and how big they\u2019re going to be,\u201d said Sharon Price John, the president and CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop, a chain of nearly 500 stores that offers an expanding menagerie of animals and characters for customers to customize, including capybaras and axolotls.",
      "The St. Louis-based company watches social media and gets ideas from talking to store employees and patrons, John said. It usually takes Build-A-Bear up to a year to introduce a new stuffed toy, she said, but the company can move faster if it spots a trend. It sometimes tests a small batch online to make sure a trend is sticking, John said.",
      "Annual trade shows in Asia, Germany and elsewhere are another place to spot new trends. Punirunes \u2013 digital, interactive pets that also come in plush varieties \u2013 are big in Japan right now and will likely take off in the U.S., toy store owner Derr said.",
      "\u201cHere, I can\u2019t give them away. They\u2019re too new. But give it a year or two,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies can kick off their own trends too. Build-A-Bear\u2019s Spring Green Frog, introduced in 2020, was an immediate hit thanks to videos posted by customers. It remains popular, with nearly 2 million sold, John said.",
      "John suspects people are drawn to friendly, slow-moving capybaras because watching videos of them are so relaxing. But shoppers who want one need to act fast. A Build-A-Bear holiday capybara with red and green sprinkles on its fur \u2013 dubbed a \u201ccookiebara\u201d \u2013 has already sold out, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "Full-size trucks are hugely popular thanks to their versatility and ability to get tough jobs done",
      "Full-size trucks are hugely popular thanks to their ability to get tough jobs done. This characteristic equally applies to those times when paved roads end and off-road hardware becomes essential to getting to your given destination. The automotive experts at Edmunds have compiled four full-size light-duty pickups that won\u2019t wilt over rough landscapes. They\u2019ve also kept in mind that all-terrain adventures should leave a little money left over for things outside of monthly truck payments. With this in mind, they\u2019ve steered clear of some of the priciest go-anywhere models and instead focused on ones that balance on-road comfort with off-road aptitude at relative affordability. All prices listed below include the destination charge.",
      "The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is well suited for fulfilling a broad range of driving needs. The Trail Boss option package can be applied to both the Custom and LT trim levels and provides an appealing mix of capability and affordability. Available exclusively with four-wheel drive, the Trail Boss is outfitted with a lifted suspension, stronger shock absorbers, underbody skid plates and all-terrain tires. During road tests, Edmunds complimented the Silverado for staying true to its old-school roots while simultaneously staying updated with the latest onboard technology.",
      "The Trail Boss can be had with three available engines. These consist of a standard 310-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder, a 305-horsepower diesel-powered six-cylinder, and a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. There\u2019s also a more expensive LT Trail Boss version with a few more standard features and an optional 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8.",
      "2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss starting price: $53,795",
      "For decades, the Ford F-Series has been America\u2019s best-selling full-size truck. It\u2019s pretty easy to see why. The 2025 Ford F-150 can be customized to be anything from a no-nonsense work truck to an opulent luxury machine. The Tremor version is meant for off-roading. It comes standard with features such as a Tremor-specific suspension to enhance off-road performance, underbody protective skidplates, and a locking rear differential and all-terrain tires to maximize available grip.",
      "The Tremor also boasts some high-tech means of scrambling over rugged terrain. This includes Trail Turn Assist, a feature that brakes the inside rear wheel to tighten the turning radius. It\u2019s a nifty piece of kit when navigating along tight trails. Under the hood is standard four-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 400-horsepower V8 or a 400-horsepower turbocharged V6. The V8 has the burlier exhaust note but the V6 makes more torque, which is helpful for acceleration and towing.",
      "2025 Ford F-150 Tremor starting price: $66,810",
      "Much of what holds true with the Chevrolet Silverado also applies to the GMC Sierra 1500. That\u2019s because the two trucks share the same mechanical bits and specifications. But befitting for a slightly more upmarket brand, GMC kits out the Sierra 1500 with nicer cabin materials and luxury add-ons. Nor is the Sierra afraid to get itself dirty when it comes to off-road duty. It\u2019s more than capable of off-roading tasks thanks to its 2-inch suspension lift, standard four-wheel drive and underbody skid plates.",
      "The all-terrain-themed trims consist of the AT4 and AT4X. The latter has a slightly higher degree of rock-crawling capability with some extra features including a locking front differential. Both versions come standard with a 305-horsepower turbocharged diesel engine or offer an available 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8. During testing, Edmunds praised the strong acceleration provided by the available 6.2-liter V8.",
      "2025 GMC Sierra AT4 starting price: $68,795",
      "The Ram 1500 is significantly updated for 2025. Highlights include slight exterior styling tweaks, some new technology features and an updated cabin. The Ram 1500 Rebel is still in the lineup too. It comes outfitted with four-wheel drive, upgraded Bilstein shock absorbers, an electronic locking rear axle and all-terrain tires. A trick air suspension is available that further allows the driver to raise the truck to increase body clearance over off-road obstacles.",
      "The Rebel can be decked out in no less than seven choices of two-tone color schemes, complete with splashy Rebel decals along the flanks of the cargo bed. Unlike its Ford, Chevy and GMC rivals, the Rebel has only one choice of engine, and it\u2019s not a V8. But that\u2019s not a demerit. Edmunds has found that the new-for-2025 420-horsepower turbocharged inline-six engine provides the quickest acceleration of the four trucks here.",

      "The proposed sale has been opposed by journalists across the Guardian Media Group, culminating in a 48-hour strike earlier this month.",

      "With credit card debt rising and prices for many items still high due to inflation, overspending during the holiday season can add to the financial stress many Americans are already experiencing, said Dr. Marketa Wills, CEO and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "\u201cThe idea that one is on the hook for buying gifts for all their friends and families adds an enormous amount of stress on someone trying to have a perfect holiday,\" Wills said.",
      "But there are ways to get through the holidays without spending more than you can afford. From setting expectations with your family to making a budget to gifting experiences rather than things, here are expert recommendations to avoid financial stress this holiday season:",
      "To avoid overspending on gifts for family and friends, set a specific goal, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app. Ask yourself what your spending limit is before you start shopping.",
      "\u201cPeople get into \u2018justification mode\u2019 where you have a general sense of what you want to spend but then you see this really nice thing and all of the sudden you\u2019ve done that a few times and you spend twice as much as you thought you might,\u201d Watson said.",
      "Watson also recommends that you include in your budget calculations how much you\u2019ll pay for taxes and shipping.",
      "In many families, the holidays mean going all out with gift-giving. But this can quickly become stressful if your finances make it hard to keep up. Managing expectations is key.",
      "\u201cYou can avoid feeling inadequate, or like you're not doing a good job, by having an honest conversation about where your finances are,\u201d Watson said.",
      "Being open about your money can be difficult, but sharing if you are struggling with debt or other financial issues can help family and friends understand that they should prioritize low-cost gifts or activities.",
      "Planning your holiday shopping ahead of time can make it easier to stick to your budget,.",
      "\u201cWhen people feel rushed, oftentimes they're going to buy more expensive things,\u201d said Watson, who also pointed out that shipping costs increase closer to Christmas.",
      "As you budget for the holidays, make a list of the items you want to purchase and slowly start buying them. This way, you divide your costs among several paychecks and avoid relying on credit for last-minute expenses.",
      "Wills recommends that people opt for homemade gifts if they want to show appreciation for their loved ones without overspending. Homemade gifts don't always have to be crafts, they can also be actions.",
      "\u201cI will do babysitting for you, I will cook a meal for you,\u201d Wills said. \u201cThose kinds of things take a financial pressure off and make for a more joyous holiday season.\u201d",
      "In recent years, shopping expert Trae Bodge has noticed that younger people prefer to gift each other experiences rather than items. She recommends finding affordable, fun activities to do with your loved ones.",
      "Examples include going ice skating, hiking or hosting a potluck. You could also gift a photoshoot or framed pictures or digital albums to commemorate happy experiences.",
      "Expectations or traditions you grew up with, such as buying expensive gifts for every member of your extended family, can cause stress during the holidays. This is what Bodge refers as \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses,\u201d which refers to trying to keep up with the expectations of other people rather than what is realistic for you to spend.",

      "When creating your own new traditions, Watson recommends sharing the financial goals you have, such as saving for a house or paying off debt. This will help your loved ones understand why you're looking to limit expenses during the holidays.",
      "Wills also recommends cutting costs by being selective with your expenses. For example, when it comes to hosting, even having a small group of people can be very expensive if you\u2019re expected to pay for everything. If you\u2019re in this situation, you could propose that everyone brings a dish.",
      "\u201cThink about having a potluck meal for the holiday. Have everybody bring something to the event to help share the cost,\u201d she said.",

      "Making room to listen to your loved ones' feelings is equally important, she said.",
      "And if the holidays are a tough time for you, Wills recommended that you prioritize your mental health and good habits such as resting well and exercising.",
      "It\u2019s the season where social events are happening every weekend but if they are causing you too much financial stress or hurting your mental health, it\u2019s okay to be selective.",
      "Additionally, if you start feeling uncomfortable about certain conversations with your family, Wills recommends you take some time for yourself by taking a walk or removing yourself from the conversation.",

      "The world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles says it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year",
      "XIAMEN, China -- The world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles said Wednesday it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year.",
      "The idea behind battery swapping is to refuel quickly, similar to filling a conventional car with gas. Instead of waiting for the batteries to recharge, one swaps out the old ones with a block of fresh ones at a swap station. An EV driver pulls into a swapping station, and automated technology exchanges the low battery for a fully-charged one the station has available.",
      "China-based CATL announced plans to open 1,000 swap stations next year in China, including in Hong Kong and Macao, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stations built with partners. If the company follows through, it could rival Nio, a 10-year-old Chinese electric car brand that has opened more than 2,700 stations and has plans for at least 5,000.",
      "Nothing on that scale exists elsewhere in the world, though Nio has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe. Such a large investment is possible in China, where government support has transformed the world's largest auto market into a heavily electric one and made the country a leader in EV technology.",
      "\u201cBy 2030, battery swapping, home charging, and public charging stations will share the market,\u201d Robin Zeng, the CEO of CATL, predicted at a splashy presentation in southeast China's Fujian province, where CATL is based. He appealed to corporate partners to work together to \"build more convenient, more economical and safer services for customers, promoting a brand-new way of life.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping faces hurdles. It requires a standardization of the battery pack so the swap stations can handle it, and most EVs have their own configuration. An electric vehicle has to be equipped with the right technology in order to use a battery swapping station, and not many EV models around the world currently allow for swapping.",
      "Conversely, an electric car can use any charging station in China because all use a common plug, and fast-charging technology is reducing the time for a recharge.",
      "Jing Yang, a Fitch Ratings director who focuses on China\u2019s auto and renewable energy sectors, said automakers may be concerned that adopting a standard battery pack could cede too much control of their supply chain to others.",
      "Electric car manufacturers have many changing specifications to stay on top of and invest in as the EV market evolves, making new technology a hard sell. It is difficult to get automakers to buy into less feasible infrastructure if EV adoption in a region is still relatively low.",
      "But some may want to test the waters to see if battery swapping can improve sales, and doing so with CATL or Nio could reduce the cost, she said. That's because a driver wouldn't have to own the battery, which is currently the most expensive part of an EV.",
      "China auto market analyst Lei Xing believes that swapping can complement the country's well-developed charging network. \u201cI don\u2019t see it becoming mainstream, but I do see it becoming a key part of that infrastructure landscape,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Davidson, a renewable energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, believes that charging will dominate \"and maybe there\u2019ll be some battery swapping options mixed in there.\u201d",
      "The concept has proven easier to implement with fleet vehicles \u2014 taxis, buses and commercial trucks \u2014 that have a standard model and, in some cases, stick to set routes. CATL, which launched a small pilot project two years ago aimed at taxis, will start its rollout with fleets and expand to individual car owners later, said Zhang Kai, the deputy president of CATL's battery swapping subsidiary.",
      "Swapping is still faster than fast-charging. The CATL station, branded EVOGO, can change a battery pack in 100 seconds, said Yang Jun, the CEO of the subsidiary. Time is money for taxi and truck drivers, Lei said.",
      "Wang Wubing, a driver at China\u2019s popular Didi ride-hailing service, said at an EVOGO station in the city of Xiamen that he swaps batteries to save time so he can pick up more customers. But it is more expensive than charging.",
      "In the U.S., battery swapping made headlines nearly two decades ago with the startup Better Place, which later shut down. Now, companies such as Ample have reinvented the technology, also starting with the ride-hailing market. Uber and Lyft drivers that own electric cars want to spend time on the road and earning money instead of waiting even for the fastest EV charge. Ample says its swaps take just 5 minutes.",
      "Both CATL and Nio have announced agreements with automakers to use their swap stations. The question is whether enough automakers and drivers adopt it to raise use of the stations to a profitable level.",

      "A British court says police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds ($3.3 million) in unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan",
      "LONDON -- A British court ruled Wednesday that police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds ($3.3 million) to cover years of unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan.",
      "The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.",
      "At Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost $12 million into an account in the name of J, were a \u201cstraightforward cheat\u201d of the tax authorities.",
      "\u201cI am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they have engaged in long-standing, deliberate conduct in order to evade their tax,\" Golspring said in his ruling.",
      "The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, so Goldspring only had to decide on the balance of probabilities whether the Tates had evaded tax.",
      "A lawyer for the police force said that the Tates were \u201cserial\u201d tax evaders who failed to pay any tax on 21 million pounds in revenue from their online businesses, including War Room, Hustlers\u2019 University, Cobra Tate and OnlyFans, between 2014 and 2022.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, accused the government of \u201coutright theft\u201d for freezing his accounts and seizing \u201ceverything they could.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not justice; it\u2019s a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system,\" Tate said in a statement. \u201cThis raises serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.\u201d",
      "At a hearing in July, attorney Sarah Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: \u201cWhen I lived in England I refused to pay tax.\u201d",
      "She said J \u2014 who can't be named because of a court order \u2014 wasn't involved with the brothers' businesses.",
      "A lawyer for the brothers, Martin Evans, argued that the bank transfers were \u201centirely orthodox\u201d for people who run online businesses. He said the siblings spent money on a number of \u201cexotic motor cars,\u201d but did nothing illegal.",
      "Court documents show an estimated total of 2,683,345.88 pounds (about $3.4 million) is held in the seven accounts police can now seize.",
      "Devon and Cornwall Police said after the ruling that \"from the outset, we have aimed to demonstrate that Andrew and Tristan Tate evaded taxes and laundered money through bank accounts located in Devon,\" a county in southwest England. The force said it would not comment further until the end of a 28-day appeal period.",
      "Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer and dual British-U.S. citizen who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X. He has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments.",
      "He and Tristan Tate, 36, face criminal allegations in Romania, including human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women. They are set to be extradited to the U.K. once those proceedings are over to face further allegations of rape and human trafficking.",

    "story": [
      "Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman and Indiana coach Curt Cignetti are football junkies at heart",
      "Marcus Freeman spent his first two seasons as the Notre Dame coach chasing the playoff dream.",
      "This year, he's living it \u2014 at home.",
      "After closing the regular season on a 10-game winning streak and getting two weeks to prepare for the most meaningful postseason game of his career, Freeman is finally ready to lead the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish against 10th-seeded Indiana on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe've been in the playoffs since Week 3,\" Freeman said, alluding to their postseason hopes following the stunning loss to Northern Illinois. \u201cEvery game we play is a version of a playoff game in our minds. We have to continue to understand that you don't have any more added pressure than you've had the previous 10.\u201d",
      "Except the Irish (11-1) know this one is different.",
      "Notre Dame hasn't made a national championship run since 1988, its longest title drought since winning the school's first in 1924. And unlike previous playoffs, the Irish will be playing the first game on campus in College Football Playoff history.",
      "Just how unusual will this environment be?",
      "It's the first time Notre Dame has hosted a postseason game, the first time Notre Dame Stadium has hosted a Friday night game and the first time since 1990 that a Notre Dame home game has not been telecast by NBC.",
      "Still, the Irish are doing what they can to make this seem like just another football week.",
      "\u201cThe hardest thing throughout this whole process has probably been finals here at Notre Dame because that's no joke,\" quarterback Riley Leonard said. \u201cOtherwise, it's like a couple of bye weeks for us. We handle it the same way. Practice has been the same, the same recipe for success.\u201d",
      "But the stakes are significantly higher in this matchup between the two Indiana schools that have met just once since 1959. Notre Dame won 49-27 in 1991.",
      "No. 9 Indiana (11-1) is the most improbable playoff entrant.",
      "Associated Press Coach of the Year Curt Cignetti engineered an eight-game turnaround in his first season with the Hoosiers, setting a new single-season school record for victories while falling just a tiebreaker short of playing for its first Big Ten title since 1967.",
      "The Hoosiers are scoring 43.3 points, the most of any playoff team, and have one of the FBS' stingiest defenses, too. And even though Indiana failed its only test against a ranked foe, the Hoosiers believe that loss will help them do what most still believe impossible \u2014 reaching the Sugar Bowl for a quarterfinal game against No. 2 seed Georgia.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough loss, but I think it was really important for us to have a game like that, to be tested and know what it takes to win these games,\u201d quarterback Kurtis Rourke said, referring to the 38-15 loss at then-No. 2 Ohio State last month. \u201cThis is a win or go home kind of setup, so we're going to have to make sure that we come with our best effort.\u201d",
      "They also may have one key advantage \u2014 postseason experience.",
      "Cignetti and many of his assistant coaches were together for FCS and Division II playoff teams, and Cignetti also has that national championship ring from his days as Alabama coach Nick Saban\u2019s recruiting coordinator.",
      "\u201cWell, I am kind of used to this routine,\" Cignetti said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major change for any of the coaches, to be quite honest with you, that are in the playoff.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame's defense has been one of the best all season despite a rash of injuries, including two that took out preseason All-Americans.",
      "But one of those, defensive tackled Howard Cross III, is expected to return Friday after missing the final three regular season games. There's little doubt Cross will be fresh, nearly six weeks after suffering the high ankle sprain. The question is will he be rested or rusty?",
      "\u201cI feel physically, fine,\u201d Cross said. \u201cSo I'm just happy, blessed to be able to get on the field.\u201d",
      "Indiana didn't just win games this season. It dominated opponents.",
      "Ten of the Hoosiers 11 wins were by 14 or more points and they faced deficits in only three games and only once in the second half. But even if that's not the same story underneath the Friday night lights, the Hoosiers insist they're ready for any challenge.",
      "\u201cWe know we\u2019re supposed to be here, we know we belong, but we\u2019re always going to have that chip (on our shoulder),\u201d Indiana receiver Elijah Sarratt said. \u201cWe remember what everyone was saying during the season and remember what everyone is saying now. We're going to go down there, focus on us and try to handle business.\u201d",
      "The most telling matchup Friday will be Notre Dame's ground game against Indiana's defense.",
      "The Irish offense has centered primarily around a three-pronged running attack that features Leonard, Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price.",
      "Indiana, meanwhile, leads the nation in fewest yards rushing per game allowed (70.8) and the 2.46 yards per carry allowed is second best in FBS. Even in their loss, Ohio State rushed 29 times for just 115 yards. So the Hoosiers know where they must begin if they hope to advance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop the run,\u201d all-Big Ten linebacker Aiden Fisher said. \u201cThat's something we\u2019re very prideful in here as a defense and something that they are really good on offense. It\u2019s going to be a really good matchup.\u201d",

      "The two teams suing NASCAR over an antitrust complaint were granted a preliminary injunction Wednesday that allowed them to compete as chartered teams in the 2025 season",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The two teams suing NASCAR over an antitrust complaint were granted a preliminary injunction Wednesday that allowed them to compete as chartered teams in the 2025 season.",
      "23XI Racing, the team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports refused in September to sign take-it-or-leave it revenue sharing offers made by NASCAR just 48 hours before the start of the playoffs.",
      "A charter is essentially a franchise and guarantees prize money, a spot in the field each week, and other protections.",
      "The teams had filed an antitrust suit alleging NASCAR is \u201cmonopolistic bullies\u201d and had been denied in federal court in November a request to be recognized as \u201cchartered\u201d teams as the suit continues.",
      "23XI and Front Row can now sign the charter agreements and still pursue the lawsuit. They also each were granted permission to purchase additional charters from Stewart Haas Racing, which closed its four-team shop at the end of the 2024 season, and NASCAR must approve the transfers to those teams.",
      "\u201c YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!\u201d Hamlin wrote on social media.",
      "It was needed win for 23XI. Tyler Reddick, who finished fourth in the 2024 Cup standings, had an opt-out clause in his contract that would have gone into effect Wednesday and made him a free agent if the team did not have a charter for next season.",
      "Jordan had said he took the fight to court on behalf of all teams competing in the top motorsports series in the United States. NASCAR had argued that the two teams simply do not like the terms of the final charter agreement and asked for the lawsuit be dismissed.",
      "Both Front Row and 23XI want to expand from two full-time cars to three, and have agreements with SHR to purchase one charter each. SHR is now Haas Factory and has a charter for one car in 2025.",
      "Until Wednesday's injunction, 23XI and Front Row would have been forced to compete next season as \u201copen\u201d teams that don\u2019t have the same protections or financial gains that come from holding a charter.",
      "The teams contend they must be chartered under some of their contractual agreements with current sponsors and drivers, and competing next year as open teams will cause significant losses.",
      "Earlier this month, the suit was transferred to a different judge than the one who heard the first round of arguments and ruled against the two teams in their request for a temporary injunction to be recognized in 2025 as chartered teams as the case proceeds.",
      "\u201cHere, the public interest strongly favors entry of a limited preliminary injunction in favor of the Plaintiffs during the 2025 NASCAR race season, both to give fans of stock car racing the opportunity to watch (and root for and against) the full slate of teams and to allow Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust legal challenges to be considered,\u201d Judge Kenneth D. Bell wrote.",
      "Front Row is owned by businessman Bob Jenkins, while 23XI is owned by Jordan, Hamlin and longtime Jordan adviser Curtis Polk.",
      "Jenkins had told The Associated Press in October that the two teams stood to miss out on $45 million in combined revenue if they competed as un-chartered teams. But he was willing to do so for Front Row because he believed the case against NASCAR was winnable.",
      "NASCAR had been operating with 36 chartered teams and four open spots since the charter agreement began in 2016.",
      "NASCAR can appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cThe availability of multiple sports in the United States says nothing about NASCAR\u2019s control of a major one of them in the same way that the availability of professional basketball and football did not lead to a finding that the NCAA was not a monopolist,\u201d the judge ruled.",

      "Lamar Jackson will finally have help he\u2019s never enjoyed before against Pittsburgh",
      "OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Lamar Jackson's struggles against Pittsburgh have been well documented.",
      "Now he'll finally have help he's never enjoyed before in this rivalry \u2014 from a packed stadium that's actually cheering for him.",
      "This weekend's showdown between the Steelers and Jackson's Baltimore Ravens is only the second time the star quarterback has faced Pittsburgh at home. And the other was in 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic limiting the announced crowd to 4,345.",
      "Expect a lot more than that Saturday, when the Steelers can clinch the AFC North with a win and the Ravens will do their best to prevent that.",
      "\u201cJust being in front of our crowd, Flock Nation, just being in the building, knowing it\u2019s a rival game, knowing what\u2019s at stake for us,\" Jackson said. \"I feel like the momentum, the momentum from our crowd, will just give us what we need \u2014 that extra boost.\u201d",
      "Jackson is 1-4 as a starter against Pittsburgh, a remarkably small number of games against a divisional opponent for a quarterback in his seventh season in the league. He beat the Steelers in his first start against them in 2019, although even in that game he was sacked five times and threw three interceptions.",
      "Jackson has never had a passer rating higher than 80.1 in a full game against Pittsburgh. He's thrown five touchdown passes and eight interceptions against the Steelers.",
      "But almost all of that has come on the road in a pretty difficult environment. In his first MVP season of 2019, Jackson sat out the home game against the Steelers after Baltimore had already wrapped up the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. The same thing happened last season. In 2021 and 2022, Jackson was injured when Pittsburgh came to Baltimore.",
      "Now the Ravens (9-5) have few excuses left if they can't take care of business at home. BetMGM had them favored by six points around midday Wednesday. Jackson is having a sensational season, with a passer rating of 120.7 that ranks among some of the best all time. He's thrown 34 touchdowns and three interceptions.",
      "\u201cI think anytime he can make a play, he\u2019s going to try to make that play. I don\u2019t think he tries to hold anything back, especially at the end of the season,\" said Steelers linebacker Patrick Queen, who played for the Ravens before this season. \"Everything\u2019s on the line at that point. There\u2019s no holding back on him. You definitely see that now, him lowering his shoulder, him stiff-arming a guy out of bounds \u2014 which is crazy \u2014 just him pushing the ball downfield is just a whole lot more plays he\u2019s trying to make.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh (10-4) arrives with a one-game lead in the division, a result of an 18-16 victory over the Ravens in Week 11. That game unfolded like so many others when Jackson has faced the Steelers: In front of a raucous crowd in Pittsburgh, everything seemed to go wrong.",
      "Baltimore missed two field goals and lost two fumbles. Jackson threw an interception when Payton Wilson basically snatched the ball away after running back Justice Hill appeared to have the pass secured in his arms.",
      "The Ravens had a chance to tie the game late, but missed a 2-point conversion. That's happened multiple times in the recent history of this rivalry. In 2021 in Pittsburgh, Baltimore went for 2 and the win with 12 seconds left. The Ravens didn't convert and lost 20-19.",
      "Baltimore has lost eight of its past nine to Pittsburgh. It doesn't feel quite that lopsided to the Ravens. They did rest starters for a couple of those games and didn't have Jackson for some others. But this season the head-to-head matchups could well decide the division.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll get talked about. I think some people got a taste of it. There were a couple of skirmishes in the last game, but this is big,\u201d Baltimore cornerback Marlon Humphrey said. \"This means a lot to a lot of people. It means a lot to me being here for a long time, and if you don\u2019t understand, the message will be very clear as the week goes on.\u201d",

      "Hirano won gold at the Beijing Games by completing a run that featured a risky triple cork jump that hadn't been landed previously as part of a complete halfpipe run. White finished fourth in that contest \u2014 the last of a career that spanned five Olympics and included three gold medals of his own.",
      "The 38-year-old envisions The Snow League as a way to unite action sports, which traditionally have run through scattered schedules that create difficulty in bringing together the best in the sport.",
      "Others in the field include Americans Maddie Mastro and Lucas Foster, 2022 Olympic medalists Queralt Castellet and Sena Tomita, and Gaon Choi, who last year became the youngest Winter X Games halfpipe gold medalist at age 14.",
      "Back-to-back Olympic champion Chloe Kim, who has supported White's league, is not on the list of competitors.",
      "White's group has secured a deal with NBC and Peacock to televise and stream the league, which kicks off March 7-8 in Aspen.",
      "Plans are to include freeskiing on the halfpipe for events beyond the debut, which have not yet been announced.",

      "Formula 1 team Red Bull has dropped Sergio Perez after months of poor results.",
      "Perez has not won a race since April 2023, even as his teammate Max Verstappen has dominated F1, and the 34-year-old Mexican was rarely competitive this season.",
      "Red Bull announced the move Wednesday, terminating Perez's contract two years early, and said a replacement will be announced \u201cin due course.\u201d",
      "Nicknamed \u201cCheco,\u201d Perez started the 2024 season with four podium finishes from the first five races, but he wasn't in the top three since. His last race finish higher than sixth was in May. Verstappen won nine races and his fourth consecutive title this year.",
      "The last time there was such a gulf in results between an F1 champion and the team\u2019s other driver in F1 was in 1994, when Verstappen\u2019s father Jos was dropped before the end of the season as Michael Schumacher won the title with Benetton.",
      "\u201cDriving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I\u2019ll always cherish the successes we achieved together,\u201d Perez said in a team statement.",
      "\u201cWe broke records, reached remarkable milestones, and I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting so many incredible people along the way,\" he added. \"A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We\u2019ll meet again soon. And remember\u2026 Never give up.\"",
      "Perez was once nicknamed the \u201cMexican Minister of Defense\u201d for his support to Verstappen in their first year as teammates in 2021, when he held up rivals and allowed Verstappen to get away. This year, they\u2019ve typically been so far apart on the track that Perez wasn\u2019t able to provide any meaningful help.",
      "Red Bull publicly kept faith with Perez, even handing him a contract extension through 2026 in June, but performances didn\u2019t improve. Red Bull had been trying to settle Perez with that extension but it \u201cobviously didn\u2019t work,\" team principal Christian Horner said this month.",
      "On Wednesday, Horner called Perez an \u201cextraordinary team player.\"",
      "\u201cHis five wins, all on street circuits, were also a spectacular mark of his determination to always push to the limit,\u201d Horner added.",

      "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- No Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball player will wear Caitlin Clark's No. 22 again.",
      "The number will be retired in a ceremony Feb. 2 at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, the Iowa athletic department announced Wednesday.",
      "Clark finished her college career last season as the all-time leading men's or women's scorer in NCAA Division I history and is widely regarded as a transformational figure in the women's game. The flair of her game and long-distance 3-point shots spawned a legion of fans adorned in her No. 22 jersey at games both home and away.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m forever proud to be a Hawkeye and Iowa holds a special place in my heart that is bigger than just basketball,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt means the world to me to receive this honor and to celebrate it with my family, friends and alumni.

Retiring her number is a testament to her extraordinary contributions and a celebration of her legacy that will continue to inspire future generations. Hawkeye fans are eager to say thank you for so many incredible moments.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Ivy League has announced its football programs will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season",
    "story": [
      "The Ivy League has announced its football programs will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The Ivy League will compete in the FCS playoffs beginning next season, the conference announced on Wednesday, ending a century-long postseason ban originally aimed at allowing the athletes to focus on their schoolwork.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental day in the Ivy League and a special day to be an Ivy League student-athlete,\u201d said Yale receiver Mason Shipp, who was the chair of the conference's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee that pushed for the change after a year-long study. \u201cFor the future generations that are fortunate enough to represent the Ivy League in the FCS playoffs, go win us some hardware!\u201d",
      "The 2024 Ivy League season ended with Columbia, Dartmouth and Harvard earning a share of the championship; it was Colombia's first conference title since 1961. The league will spend the offseason coming up with a tiebreaker to determine how its automatic qualifier for the FCS playoffs will be awarded.",
      "\u201cThank you to the Presidents for giving the student-athletes an opportunity to compete for a national championship,\u201d Harvard coach Andrew Aurich said. \u201cIvy League football is the most competitive it\u2019s ever been and I\u2019m excited for us to make some noise in the playoffs for years to come.\u201d",
      "The schools that would later form the Ivy League were a force in college football in the leather helmet days that predated the forward pass, with Yale and Princeton winning 23 of the sport\u2019s first 25 unofficial national championships in the late 1800s. Harvard claimed the other two and went on to add five more, including a 1919 title that was sealed by a victory over Oregon in the Rose Bowl.",
      "That would be \u2013 for at least the next century \u2013 the Crimson\u2019s only postseason appearance, with Harvard, Yale and Princeton voting a few years later to decline bowl invitations and maintain their focus on academics.",
      "A few things have changed since then.",
      "As college football grew, the balance of power shifted from the Northeast to the south and west. Mammoth stadiums turned the sport from a quaint little endeavor for the students to a focus of campus life. Lucrative television contracts helped fuel the business for schools. Athletic scholarships became a lure for player, and the rise of the NFL gave college players a chance to make football a career.",
      "Still, the Ivy League, which became a formal athletic conference in 1954, resisted the temptation of big-money college sports, forsaking bowl games and what is now the FCS playoffs to avoid the disruption on academics. But what really made its football postseason ban an anomaly was the growing number of other sports at the schools.",
      "At Harvard, longtime football coach Tim Murphy liked to point out his was the only one of the school\u2019s 42 varsity sports that was deprived the opportunity to participate in its postseason.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and the Southwestern Athletic Conference are the two remaining FCS playoff holdouts. (The biggest football conferences and schools, like Alabama and Georgia in the Southeastern Conference and Michigan and Ohio State in the Big Ten, compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision, which crowns its national champion through the separate College Football Playoff.)",
      "Although the sport has mostly outgrown the Ivy League roots that pioneered the forward pass, the bowl-shaped stadium and \u2014 more recently \u2014 tackle-free practice to diminish the risk of concussions, a player from the conference has participated in 10 of the last 12 Super Bowls. NFL front offices and sidelines are also teeming with Ivy alums.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League prides itself on a storied tradition of impact, influence and competitive success throughout the history of college football,\" executive director Robin Harris said. \u201cWe now look ahead to a new chapter of success.\u201d",

      "Besides first-round games at on-campus sites, the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff also serves up something now for this postseason: cold-weather northern venues as opposed to bowl games in warm, sunny climates",
      "Asked if playing in near-freezing weather at Ohio State might pose a challenge for his team, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel quickly noted that it wouldn\u2019t be the Volunteers\u2019 first rodeo with the cold.",
      "Kicker Max Gilbert even posted a photo last week standing with teammates as light snow fell before a morning practice. And, Tennessee beat cross-state rival Vanderbilt last month on a tundra of sorts with a kickoff temperature of 41 degrees before dropping to the 30s in the fading daylight. A combination of heated benches, portable heaters and extra layers helped take the chill off, along with a 36-23 comeback victory.",
      "The Saturday night forecast calls for temperatures in the high teens and low 20s with a slight chance of snow for the first-round College Football Playoff matchup in Columbus, Ohio. But with few degrees of separation between climates in the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, it won\u2019t feel much different when the Vols venture 350 miles north to face the Buckeyes.",
      "\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a June day in South Dakota,\" Heupel joked this week. \"It\u2019s going to be great football weather. A couple of weeks ago we played in 30 degree weather. We practice in the morning, still a chill, as cold as it will be around this area. And at the end of the day, you get between the white lines, weather doesn\u2019t matter. The temperature doesn\u2019t. And we\u2019ll be ready to go play. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "The playoff this year for the first time is holding first-round games on campus and that opens things up in terms of potential weather. Whether his weekend's official start of winter has a chilling effect on the outcome in the expanded 12-team playoff remains to be seen, but it\u2019s a definite departure from warm climates Power Four teams are used to for postseason games.",
      "The prospect of spending the Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day holidays preparing for a bowl in a sunny locale is considered an incentivizing finish to a long season.",
      "Warmer destinations and indoor stadiums await the first-round winners in the quarterfinals, but no one\u2019s complaining about the chance to play in \u201cideal\u201d football weather that many players grew up with. This additional postseason layer may require, well, layering for players, but cold comes with the territory and is worth the sacrifice of playing for a national championship.",
      "\u201cWhether there\u2019s snow or not snow, whether it\u2019s really cold or just kind of cold, it is what it is,\u201d said SMU coach Rhett Lashlee, who noted his players' aspirations of an NFL career certainly can should include the likelihood of wintry weather.",
      "\u201cThey aspire to play championship football, which we\u2019re getting to do right now,\" said Lashlee, who played his high school and college football in Arkansas. \"The weather is only going to be an issue if we allow it, so we know it\u2019s going to be really cold. It\u2019s going to be really cold for them as well. So it\u2019s our 11 versus their 11.\u201d",
      "Ditto for fans who willingly accept cold hands, feet and noses if it means rooting on their teams.",
      "\u201cThey get a little bit more snow but as far as temperature, we\u2019ve been mostly in the 30s for the last couple of weeks and been in the 20s for two nights,\" said longtime Tennessee season ticket holder Earl Brown, 75, who will be in The Horseshoe with wife Judy and three others. \"Plus, the game\u2019s up there and it will be my 355th consecutive game. So, I don\u2019t think it really matters if it\u2019s snow, rain and sleet or 85 degrees. I will be in the stadium.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe'll put on six, seven layers, probably,\u201d Judy Brown said.",
      "The State College forecast calls for low 20s dropping into the low teens when Penn State hosts SMU on Saturday night. Lashlee jokingly lamented pleasant 70-degree temperatures in Dallas for workouts but doesn't expect a huge adjustment for his team after playing last month's Atlantic Coast Championship in the 30s in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "The coach added that non-bowl December football is also new territory for Penn State, which means it will also be cold on the Nittany Lions' bench.",
      "Temperature-wise (low to mid-20s), Indiana players and fans won't notice much change between Bloomington and what the Hoosiers will face 200 miles upstate in South Bend for Friday night's matchup at Notre Dame. The daytime forecast includes a 63% chance of snow, conditions the Fighting Irish embrace in a hype video featuring clips of the white stuff.",
      "Having won at Purdue in the snow and seeing it elsewhere while playing at Ohio, Indiana quarterback Curtis Rourke looks forward to whatever awaits in Notre Dame Stadium \u2014 including noise to wake up the echoes.",
      "\u201cHaving snow fall in the stadium, that was pretty cool,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cSnow games are pretty fun, so I\u2019m looking forward to it if that\u2019s the case.\u201d",

      "Vonn retired in 2019 not because she was slowing down, but because she was broken down.",

    "story": [
      "Wake Forest has hired Washington State\u2019s Jake Dickert to become the Demon Deacons\u2019 next football coach",
      "Wake Forest moved quickly in reaching across the country to find its next football coach.",
      "The school hired Washington State's Jake Dickert on Wednesday, two days after Dave Clawson resigned unexpectedly following 11 seasons that included regular bowl bids and an Atlantic Coast Conference division title.",
      "\u201cCoach Dickert\u2019s approach to building a program \u2014 through evaluation and development of talent with a plan rooted in detail, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to student-athlete development \u2014 reminds me of what made Dave Clawson so successful during his 11-year transformational tenure as our head football coach,\u201d athletic director John Currie said in a statement.",
      "\u201cJake\u2019s philosophy of fostering personal growth, cultivating trust within the team, and relentlessly competing for championships embodies the principles we hold dear.\u201d",
      "Dickert, 41, had been the defensive coordinator when he took over during the 2021 season as the Cougars' interim coach after Washington State fired Nick Rolovich for refusing a state mandate that all employees get vaccinated against COVID-19. Dickert led the team to a 3-3 finish to earn the permanent job, then went 20-17 in the three seasons since.",
      "The Athletic first reported that Wake Forest was set to hire Dickert, whose introductory news conference was scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe will have a clear focus on retaining our current roster while adding valuable pieces that fit our program and Wake Forest University,\u201d Dickert said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, I am excited to immerse myself in this special community as throughout this process my belief that this is the perfect place for our family and our program only strengthened.\u201d",
      "Washington State has spent nine weeks in the AP Top 25 poll over the past two seasons, peaking at No. 13 during a five-week run amid a 4-0 start in 2023 and reaching No. 19 in early November of this season.",
      "Washington State went 8-4 this year, the first since the Pac-12 fell apart, with the majority of its schools scattering to the ACC, Big 12 and Big Ten. Now Dickert is back in a power conference again, nine days before his Cougars are set to play No. 22 Syracuse in the Holiday Bowl (Dec. 27).",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Washington State athletic director Anne McCoy said assistant head coach and defensive tackles coach Pete Kaligis would lead the team in the bowl game.",
      "\u201cThis team has worked so hard and accomplished a great deal this year,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cthey deserve to end the season with a memorable bowl game experience.\u201d",
      "Dickert arrived at Washington State after a three-year run at Wyoming in a career with stops at the Division II level, though those generally were at schools in the central part of the country or further west. A job at Southeast Missouri State in 2012 was his farthest east.",
      "He'll relocate to the Eastern Seaboard for the job at Wake Forest, an elite private university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with one of the smallest undergraduate enrollments in the Bowl Subdivision ranks (5,471 students in the 2023-24 academic year). It comes as the Demon Deacons have had consecutive 4-8 seasons in Clawson's otherwise successful run, a product of a changing landscape in college sports that hindered Wake Forest's formula of retaining and developing players to compete with schools featuring four- and five-star prospects.",
      "Notably, those changes have included free player movement through the transfer portal and players being able to profit from their athletic fame through name, image and likeness opportunities \u2014 a combination that has led to roster upheaval across college sports.",
      "In Wake Forest's case, the Demon Deacons had an 11-win season that included a trip to the ACC title game in 2021, as well as brief stints in the top 10 of the AP Top 25 in 2021 and 2022 amid a run of seven straight bowl appearances before the two four-win seasons.",
      "In an emotional news conference Tuesday, Clawson said he \u201cjust felt like it was time\u201d to step aside to let Wake Forest take a fresh approach to the changes, which include the looming arrival of revenue sharing with athletes. He said he had \u201cengaged\u201d with some candidates for the job already as he shifts into an advisory role with Currie.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s things I can help with (in) the transition,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be the old coach in the office that\u2019s overlooking you or second-guessing you. I\u2019ve told every one of them: \u2018I will be as involved or uninvolved as you want me to be.\u2019 ... If I can help the new coach with that learning curve, I\u2019ll do it. If the new coach says, \u2018Dave, stay the hell away, it\u2019s my program,\u2019 I will stay the hell away and do nothing but support him.\u201d",
      "Clawson went as far as to say it felt as if it was \u201csomebody else\u2019s job.\u201d",
      "And now, that somebody is Dickert.",

      "LONDON -- The ATP men's tennis tour paid out $1.3 million to a total of 26 players in 2024 under a new financial program called Baseline that guarantees minimum annual incomes for players ranked in the top 250.",
      "Players received money in each of three categories, the tour said Wednesday, without naming most of the individuals: 17 got paid as part of minimum guarantees that make up the difference if players do not reach certain thresholds in singles prize money, three through injury protection that helps those whose tournament participation is limited by health issues, and seven via newcomer investment that provides funds to new members of the top 125.",
      "One player received money from both the minimum guarantee and income protection parts of the plan, which was announced in August 2023. This season was the first of a three-year trial.",
      "\u201cAs a professional tennis player, you\u2019re focused on results. Relying on your performance to succeed can be difficult, especially when dealing with setbacks like injuries,\" said Bernab\u00e9 Zapata Miralles, who got a minimum guarantee to boost his season's earnings. \u201cWe now have the comfort we need to improve, without the pressure of financial uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Based on 2023 year-end rankings and 2024 earnings, the ATP made up the difference for players who didn't reach certain thresholds: $300,000 for the top 100, $150,000 for men ranked from 101 to 175, and $75,000 for those from 176 to 250.",
      "Those figures will rise next season to $200,000 for Nos. 101-175, and $100,000 Nos. 176-250.",
      "Just for the sake of context, year-end No. 1 Jannik Sinner led men's tennis with $16.9 million in prize money in 2024, while No. 100 Federico Coria took home about $590,000, and No. 250 Abdullah Shelbayh earned just under $205,000 in singles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re giving players the financial support they need to overcome challenges and build a sustainable career,\" said ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi, a former player.",
      "Players need to sign up to be considered for the program and the tour hopes more will take part than the more than 100 who did in 2024.",

    "summary": "The group behind a breakaway European soccer competition to rival the Champions League has resurfaced",
    "story": [
      "The group behind a breakaway European soccer competition to rival the Champions League has resurfaced",
      "The group behind a proposed breakaway European soccer competition is back.",
      "They have a new name for their tournament, too, calling it the Unify League this time.",
      "The latest idea for an elite competition for the biggest teams in Europe is being put forward by Madrid-based A22 Sports Management, which is seeking to change the face of the sport in its most lucrative market by creating a rival for the Champions League and other UEFA tournaments.",
      "It comes nearly four years after the initial plan of a European Super League was ambitiously launched and then quickly quashed. It's been a rocky journey, to say the least, and there's still a long way to go before a breakaway league comes to fruition \u2014 if it ever does.",
      "Late one Sunday night in April 2021, a dozen of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs rocked the soccer world by announcing plans to create a breakaway European Super League, which would have effectively replaced the Champions League \u2014 Europe\u2019s elite club competition. The 12 rebel teams were Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. They proposed a 20-team elite tournament that was largely closed because 15 were protected from relegation. The plan collapsed within 48 hours after the six English clubs pulled out and issued apologies amid a backlash from their own fans and the government. Three others \u2014 AC Milan, Inter and Atl\u00e9tico \u2014 also quickly backed out.",
      "Well, it never quite went away. Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus carried on the fight behind the scenes, seemingly forlornly. Juventus withdrew midway through 2023 but the two Spanish powers held out, and scored a win in December of that year when the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that UEFA and world governing body FIFA acted contrary to EU competition law by blocking plans for the breakaway league. Emboldened, A22 \u2014 formed to assist the creation and promotion of the Super League \u2014 immediately announced new proposed competitions for men and women, saying young fans are \u201cturning away\u201d from soccer. More details about these competitions came on Tuesday.",
      "A22 said Tuesday it has submitted proposals to UEFA and FIFA for official recognition of its proposed midweek competition, which would contain 96 men's teams across four leagues \u2014 Star, Gold, Blue and Union \u2014 and 32 women's teams in two leagues \u2014 Star and Gold. Eight teams would qualify for the knockout stage in each league. All teams involved in the Unify League are being guaranteed a minimum of 14 matches per season. Qualification will not be automatic but \u201cbased on annual performance\" in the domestic European leagues, A22 said. A key part of the new format would be free streaming of games on a branded \u201cUnify\u201d platform to, in A22\u2019s words, \u201cdirectly connect clubs to their global fan bases\" and \u201cimprove the viewing experience at home by eliminating the need for multiple subscriptions.\" There would also be a premium subscription offered without adverts. If the plans get the green light, it in theory gives Europe\u2019s clubs a choice: Stay with the existing European competitions run by UEFA or join a breakaway competition.",
      "No team has publicly backed the Unify League, strengthening the existing skepticism about the project. A22 said its plans had come after discussions with clubs, leagues and \u201cother parties\u201d but didn\u2019t go into more details. Not even Barcelona or Madrid \u2014 the remaining holdouts from the original Super League \u2014 have commented, though the Spanish league has. As expected, the league's reaction was scathing, saying the project \u201cthreatens the governance of European football\u201d and would \u201cdestroy the economy of national leagues.\u201d \u201cThe project continues to lack support from clubs, federations, players, fans, national governments and European institutions,\u201d La Liga said. There was no official response from any other major league, or from UEFA or FIFA.",
      "It still seems a non-starter at this stage \u2014 and the outcry caused by the original rebellion would likely make most clubs retain the status quo. That is especially the case in England, with the popular and lucrative Premier League having said last year it \u201ccontinues to reject any such concept\u201d of a Super League. Part of the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 charter states that clubs \u201cwill not engage in the creation of new competition formats outside of the Premier League\u2019s Rules\u201d and a proposed U.K. government bill would block English teams from trying to join a breakaway league. Financial details about the Unify League remain sketchy \u2013 for example, who is funding this? \u2013 and the latest plans come at a time when there has been a redrawing of the power dynamic in European football. UEFA has a revamped, more lucrative and more open Champions League, FIFA has its big new club competition in the Club World Cup, with financial backing from Saudi Arabia. Put simply, there\u2019s not the widespread discontent in soccer as there was four years ago. However, A22 is confident the rebranded competition complies with UEFA\u2019s required authorization rules because of the revised feature that annual qualification is based on domestic league performance. John Hahn, co-founder of A22, said he had \u201cnot been expecting the public support of clubs at this time.\u201d \u201cLogically,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will come following the official recognition of the Unify League.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo stood side-by-side during the postgame celebration after the NBA Cup final. Antetokounmpo was holding the MVP trophy. Lillard was holding the bigger trophy.",
      "And it was a moment that Lillard had waited a long time to savor.",
      "He's been a rookie of the year, a 3-point contest champion, an All-Star MVP, even a member of the league's 75th anniversary team. And while his biggest goal is still winning an NBA championship, the significance of winning the NBA Cup was not lost on the 13-year veteran.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of experience individually where I\u2019ve had accomplishments and stuff,\u201d Lillard said after the Bucks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 97-81 on Tuesday night in the Cup final. \u201cBut to have some team success and win something and be the last team standing in this tournament, it feels great.\u201d",
      "The Bucks have a championship coach in Doc Rivers, the core of a team that won a title in 2021 \u2014 Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton among them \u2014 and one of the game's elite guards in Lillard. Starting 1-6 and 2-8 this year might have raised some eyebrows, but the Bucks insisted that they never doubted themselves.",
      "They've been one of the league's hottest teams since that awful start and rolled through the in-season tournament with a 7-0 record. Winning the NBA Cup might be a reminder \u2014 perhaps an unnecessary one \u2014 of the Bucks' potential.",
      "\u201cI think it reminds us that we can beat anybody,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t care if it tells everybody else that. We only care about us. It\u2019s what I said on the first day of camp. I also said we can lose to anybody if we don\u2019t play right.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo and Lillard are leading the way, and that can't be a surprise.",
      "Both are playing at their perennial All-Star level. They're the highest-scoring duo in the league, combining to average more than 58 points per game. They were the best two players on the floor in the NBA Cup final, Antetokounmpo getting a triple-double \u2014 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists \u2014 on his way to MVP honors, and Lillard scoring 23.",
      "Year 1 of their pairing after Lillard wound up in Milwaukee after 11 years in Portland wasn't perfect. It was good, not great. Year 2 is clearly better. It's another sign of what might be for the Bucks going forward.",
      "\u201cPeople wanted to put me with Giannis and think it was just going to be perfect right away because we\u2019ve both been high-level players,\u201d Lillard said. \"But I come from a situation where I\u2019ve always had the ball, and he\u2019s had a decade of him having the ball and playing a certain way.",
      "\u201cI think time is the No. 1 thing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just took time for us to get to know each other better as people. You can\u2019t just trust somebody that you\u2019re paired with when you don\u2019t really know who they are, how they think and how they operate. So, I think time has helped us.\u201d",
      "Time has helped Lillard as well.",
      "He averaged 24.3 points and 7 assists per game last year. Those are all-world numbers for just about anyone. He didn't think much of how he played, though, and he never got to the point of feeling totally comfortable in a new role, a new place, with a new team.",
      "He does now.",
      "\u201cGetting healthy, getting my training in and having my mind right coming back into the season was all it really was for me,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWhen we lost in the playoffs last year, I said it right after the game. \u2018People will see.\u2019\u201d",
      "Seeing is believing.",
      "There's still more than two-thirds of the regular season left. Cleveland \u2014 Milwaukee's first opponent when the Bucks return to regular-season play on Friday \u2014 and defending NBA champion Boston have clearly been the best two teams in the Eastern Conference to this point. There are tons of challenges ahead and there surely will be plenty of ebbs and flows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy for Dame that we got our first trophy together,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThis is just the beginning. We have to keep on improving and getting better, and we will be better.\u201d",

New York lost both of those games and the Bills joined the 1983 Packers as the only teams in NFL history to win a game when allowing at least 40 points and lose a game scoring at least 40 in the same season.",
      "Bills quarterback Josh Allen also became the second quarterback with back-to-back games with at least 400 yards rushing and passing, at least four total TDs and no turnovers. Joe Burrow did it in 2021.",
      "Week 15 was the final one of the regular season that featured teams coming off byes with six teams playing on extra rest on Sunday.",
      "Those teams went 4-2 with Baltimore, Denver, Houston and Washington getting wins, while Indianapolis and New England lost.",
      "For the season, coming off the bye proved to be of little benefit with teams playing after a week off going 15-17 with the extra rest. That marked the second time in the last 10 seasons that teams coming off the bye had a losing record, with teams going 11-21 in 2019.",
      "The advantage of the bye has lessened since the 2011 CBA limited the amount of practice time teams could have during the week off. From 2002-10, teams had a .557 win percentage following the bye week compared to .523 since 2011.",
      "On the NFL's most turnover-happy day in eight years, the Tennessee Titans and Cincinnati Bengals took the sloppy play to new lows.",
      "The Titans gave the ball away six times and the Bengals committed four turnovers in Cincinnati's 37-27 win for the first 10-giveaway game in the NFL since Week 2 of the 2007 season when Detroit and Minnesota each had five in a 20-17 overtime win for the Lions.",
      "The game included one of two fumbles this week by a player just before he crossed the goal line and contributed to the 51 turnovers overall on Sunday for the most on any day since there were also 51 on Dec. 11, 2016.",
      "The sloppy play at Tennessee was about more than turnovers with the Bengals getting penalized 14 times and the Titans 12. That made the game the first since the 1970 merger with at least 10 turnovers and 25 penalties.",
      "Caleb WIlliams entered the league with the fanfare of being the answer to Chicago's long search for a franchise quarterback. It hasn't worked out that way so far for the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "Williams lost his eighth straight start for the Bears on Monday night against Minnesota to tie Trevor Lawrence (2021) for the second longest losing streak for a rookie QB picked first overall since the start of the common draft era in 1967. Troy Aikman lost all 11 starts he made as a rookie for Dallas in 1989 before going on to win three Super Bowls.",
      "Williams has lost those games despite not throwing an interception in any of the games for an NFL rookie record 286 straight passes without a pick. That's the most consecutive losses for any QB since the merger without throwing an interception, topping the previous high of five by Jeff George (1993-94) and Cody Kessler (2016).",
      "The Bears were officially eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15, leaving Andrew Luck as the only quarterback picked first in the common draft era to start a playoff game as a rookie.",

      "As women\u2019s sports set new records for attendance and viewership this year, longtime fans have watched with both optimism and unease",
      "NEW YORK -- For Djaniele Taylor, attending WNBA games was the perfect way to rediscover a sense of community coming out of the long slog of pandemic-era lockdowns.",
      "The 38-year-old Evanston, Illinois, resident has regularly attended Chicago Sky games for the last three seasons, after she watched the team win its first championship in 2021. As a queer Black fan, she felt the games were a supportive and safe sporting environment.",
      "\u201cI was hooked and I loved the atmosphere \u2014 it was very queer-friendly, very family-oriented, very diverse,\u201d she said.",
      "As the popularity of the WNBA skyrocketed this year, Taylor watched the price of her season tickets more than double since 2022. With the growth, she noted a \u201cdarker vibe shift,\u201d too: What always felt like a positive setting started to take a more hostile turn at times.",
      "As women's sports set new records for attendance and viewership, Taylor and other longtime fans watched with optimism \u2014 and unease. It\u2019s a cycle female athletes and fans of women\u2019s sports have come to recognize: With the increased and sought-after visibility also comes added scrutiny \u2014 as well as harassment and online abuse toward some players.",
      "This year, fresh off the NCAA spotlight, former college basketball stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese made their WNBA debut for the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky, catapulting their personal brands as well as the popularity of the league among viewers.",
      "Fans are tuning in for the love of the sport, as they always have, said Amira Rose Davis, assistant professor in the Department of African and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Texas-Austin. But they\u2019re also drawn by the dynamics between players like Clark and Reese, who faced each other in the 2023 NCAA championship between the University of Iowa and Louisiana State University.",
      "While both deny there's any bad blood between them, tension has been drummed up by fans and increased media attention. Beneath it are racial undertones that originated while the two played in college \u2014 with predominantly white Iowa pitted against predominantly Black LSU, and Clark and Reese \u201cemerging as these kind of archetypes that people can run with,\u201d Davis said.",
      "\u201cThat really raises the engagement and just the raw numbers of viewership. And then it also solidifies those narratives,\u201d she said.",
      "It's also led to harassment and abuse \u2014 much of it racially motivated and directed at players of color across the league and the wider sports landscape.",
      "\u201cAngel and Caitlin have given us an incredible platform to talk about how we treat Black and white athletes differently in the media,\u201d said E.R. Fightmaster, co-host of Jockular, a podcast on the intersection of women\u2019s sports and queer identity.",
      "During the playoff matchup in September between the Connecticut Sun and Indiana Fever, the Sun\u2019s DiJonai Carrington posted an email she received with a racial slur and graphic death and sexual assault threats.",
      "Her teammate, Alyssa Thomas, shared her own experience.",
      "\u201cIn my 11-year career, I\u2019ve never experienced racial comments (like) from the Indiana Fever fan base,\u201d Thomas said, after the Sun eliminated the Fever from the playoffs.",
      "For her part, Clark has disavowed the toxic discourse, though some say she hasn't done enough to try to rein in the racism by some of her Indiana Fever fans.",
      "\u201cPeople should not be using my name to push those agendas. It\u2019s disappointing. It\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Clark said back in June. \u201dTreating every single woman in this league with the same amount of respect, I think, it\u2019s just a basic human thing that everybody should do.\u201d",
      "At the end of the 2024 season after facing some criticism for initially failing to condemn the harassment, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said, \u201cThere\u2019s no place in sports for this,\" and vowed to attack it \"multidimensionally.\u201d",
      "The league should have done a better job preparing for the harassment, said Frankie de la Cretaz, a freelance writer whose work explores sports, culture and queer identity. \"They should have seen it coming based on the discourse between fans around Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese in college.\u201d",
      "The NCAA released a study in October showing online abuse toward student-athletes peaked during March Madness, with women\u2019s basketball players receiving three times more threats than men\u2019s players. For the first time in March Madness history, the women\u2019s championship game drew more viewers this year than the men\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting, of course, to see the increased visibility of that increased popularity, but it is extremely concerning and disappointing to see what has come along with that,\u201d said Lynn Holzman, vice president for NCAA women\u2019s basketball.",
      "A similar study found racist and sexist posts aimed at female athletes made up nearly half of all monitored abusive posts during the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.",
      "At the summer games, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced hateful comments and false accusations about her gender leading up to her gold medal win.",
      "The false narratives, perpetuated by internet trolls and public figures like President-elect Donald Trump and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J. K. Rowling, highlighted how female athletes of color have faced disproportionate scrutiny and discrimination when it comes to sex testing and false accusations that they are male or transgender.",
      "\u201cPeople want a chance to delegitimize successful women all the time. And so if you are a successful boxer and they can\u2019t find anything else to pick on, they are going to say that you are too manly to play,\u201d Fightmaster said.",
      "Khelif urged an end to bullying athletes. \u201cIt can destroy people, it can kill people\u2019s thoughts, spirit and mind,\u201d she said.",
      "The issue of transgender women competing in women\u2019s sports has been highly polarized this year. A former University of Kentucky swimmer was among a dozen athletes filing a federal lawsuit against the NCAA in March, accusing it of violating Title IX rights by allowing a transgender woman, Lia Thomas, to compete at the 2022 national championships.",
      "The lawsuit also cited unconfirmed reports that a transgender woman was playing on the San Jose State women's volleyball team. This fall, colleges began dropping out of matches with San Jose State, which has not confirmed it has a trans woman on the team. The Associated Press has withheld the player\u2019s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped politicians from shaping campaigns around keeping transgender women out of women\u2019s sports or wading into the polarizing debate on fairness.",
      "About half of U.S. states have a ban on transgender athletes participating in school sports according to their gender identity. This year, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law banning transgender athletes from grades 5-12. Ohio banned trans athletes as young as kindergarteners. West Virginia and Idaho are looking to the U.S. Supreme Court to support their bans.",
      "Even as women's sports reach new heights in viewership and with it ticket sales and lucrative deals, inequalities persist, including disparities in pay, the quality of women's sports facilities and online harassment of female athletes.",
      "\"It's disingenuous to me if we are going to celebrate the rise of women's sports but not address the ways in which we're treating women athletes differently,\" said Cheryl Cooky, professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Purdue University.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that the rise of women's sports can happen in absence of the vitriolic rhetoric that we've seen.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Indiana coach Curt Cignetti pursued Kurtis Rourke in the transfer portal because he wanted a proven winner",
      "Indiana coach Curt Cignetti pored through the transfer portal last December, looking for a proven quarterback with a winning resume who could quickly become the cornerstone in another rebuilding project.",
      "He landed on 23-year-old Kurtis Rourke, the 2022 Mid-American Conference MVP.",
      "Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman had a far simpler pitch to former Duke quarterback Riley Leonard \u2014 win a national championship and go down in Fighting Irish lore.",
      "Both coaches took big swings on their respective one-year hired guns and on Friday, they'll reap the reward when Rourke leads the 10th-seeded Hoosiers against the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish in what looked like an impossible first-round College Football Playoff matchup all those months ago.",
      "\u201cWe've had to prove, a lot of us have had to prove we belong wherever we are,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cIt just fuels us, knowing that we're counted out and we're the underdog and we always will be \u2014 at least for this year \u2014 so we can go in and play freely and that we're capable of competing with anybody.\"",
      "For Rourke, Leonard, Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel and Ohio State quarterback Will Howard, there won't be a next year. Each transferred to their playoff-bound schools with one college season left, so whatever happens over the next month must suffice.",
      "If any of the four bring home a national championship, they could cement this model for years or decades given what all four have achieved.",
      "Rourke's ninth-ranked Hoosiers (11-1, No. 8 CFP) already have left quite a legacy.",
      "They broke the school records for single-season wins, scuttled preseason projections of a 17th-place finish in the 18-team Big Ten by tying for second \u2014 ahead of perennial powers Michigan and Ohio State, came within a tiebreaker of playing for their first conference crown since 1967 and earned one of the precious 12 playoff bids.",
      "Cignetti left nothing to chance. He brought most of his staff and 13 players from James Madison to Indiana, and the continuity helped speed up the transition.",
      "He also brought more than a dozen other transfers including Rourke, who looked like a perfect fit \u2014 mature, 33 starts and 21 wins in his career, a high completion percentage and low interception rate and a brother, Nathan, who also played at Ohio before going pro.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s played a lot of football, and you learn by doing,\" said Cignetti, who was named The Associated Press Coach of the Year on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten a lot of reps playing quarterback, a lot of successful reps. He\u2019s a quick thinker, and he processes quickly. He\u2019s extremely accurate, and he\u2019s good in the pocket. He doesn\u2019t panic. He has certainly taken his game to another level.\u201d",
      "Rourke, who got married in February, wanted to play another year and was intrigued by Cignetti's confidence, system and history of cultivating conference player-of-the-year quarterbacks at previous schools.",
      "The results were impeccable despite Rourke suffering a late-season thumb injury on his throwing hand, which required surgery. Despite missing one game, Rourke heads into the final month of this season as the most efficient passer in the FBS (181.38) and ranked near the top nationally in completion percentage (70.4%) and touchdown passes (27) on the highest scoring team (43.3 points) in the playoff.",
      "He was named second-team all-Big Ten, behind Gabriel and ahead of Howard. Freeman has already seen enough on tape to know what Notre Dame's stout defense is up against.",
      "\u201cEvery great offense is led by a great quarterback and this is no different,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cHe's been in big games, he's played a lot of football games, and he makes really good decisions. He knows where he's going with his throws, he knows what he's looking for and he executes at a high level.\u201d",
      "Leonard poses different problems for the Hoosiers.",
      "One of the nation's top rushing quarterbacks chose Notre Dame because of its tradition and the lure of leading one of college football's blueblood programs to end a 36-year title drought, the longest since Notre Dame claimed its first title in 1924.",
      "Freeman took this journey last year when Sam Hartman left Wake Forest and spent his final college season in South Bend. But Freeman isn't necessarily married to the concept of recruiting a new starting quarterback every year.",
      "\u201cThere's a process it takes to make sure your quarterback and your offense are performing at the highest levels they can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are also ways to expedite the process as I think Riley and coach (Mike) Denbrock and coach (Gino) Guidugli have been doing. As far as moving forward, it's not something on worrying about in the future.\u201d",
      "That's why the Irish (11-1, No. 3 AP) have made it to the playoffs for the first time since 2021 \u2014 and the first time with Freeman running the show.",
      "A year ago, with Hartman, Notre Dame's title hopes were derailed by two early season losses. This year, Leonard helped the Irish rebound from their stunning September loss to Northern Illinois by leading them to 10 straight wins while joining five Power 4 quarterbacks to top 1,900 yards passing and 650 yards rushing.",
      "And with the Irish just four wins away from their ultimate goal, Leonard is ready for one last ride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in every situation, played in a lot of big-time games, too. So I\u2019ve been in this situation, I know what it\u2019s like,\" said Leonard, who has rushed for 33 career TDs. \u201cTo make it where we are now is kind of why I came to Notre Dame. I came here to compete, to make the playoff and to compete for a national championship.\u201d",

      "Auburn standout center Johni Broome left Tuesday's win over Georgia State after injuring his right shoulder while going for a defensive rebound in the first three minutes of the eventual 100-59 victory",
      "AUBURN, Ala. -- Auburn standout center Johni Broome left Tuesday night's win over Georgia State early in the first half after injuring his right shoulder.",
      "Broome was battling for a defensive rebound when he immediately grabbed his right shoulder and ran off the court, straight to the locker room, where he was evaluated by team doctors. He left the game just 2:17 into the eventual 100-59 victory that improved the No. 2-ranked Tigers to 10-1.",
      "He returned to the Auburn bench midway through the first half with an ice pack on his right shoulder. The 6-foot-10 senior had two points and a blocked shot when he left the game.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, Johni\u2019s right shoulder kind of slipped out and came back,\u201d Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said on the team\u2019s postgame radio show. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a look at it tomorrow, get an MRI tomorrow, take a peek. He did this a year ago, so he\u2019s probably got some micro stuff and things like that. He was able to move (the shoulder) around a little bit in the training room.\u201d",
      "Pearl said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d that Broome would be available against No. 16 Purdue on Saturday, but did not completely rule Broome out for the game.",
      "Broome suffered an injury to the same shoulder during a preseason exhibition in 2023. He did not miss any time during the regular season, but wore a protective sleeve on the shoulder for the first several games.",
      "\u201cHe did it a year ago, so he\u2019s had some experience with it,\u201d Pearl told reporters after the game. \u201d(We\u2019ll) take a look at it tomorrow and tell you more. We hope he\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "Broome's injury comes during what has been a strong start to the season. He entered Tuesday's game averaging 19.7 points and a Division I-leading 12.7 rebounds. Broome had 21 points, six assists and a career-best 20 rebounds in Saturday in a 91-53 win over Ohio State in Atlanta.",
      "If Broome is unable to play against Purdue, Auburn would turn to senior forward Chaney Johnson to replace him in the starting lineup. Johnson scored a career-high 26 points and had eight rebounds in the win over Georgia State.",
      "\u201cChaney could be starting this year, very easily,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cAnd so it would affect (us), certainly, if you lose maybe one of the best players in college basketball \u2014 certainly a player of the year candidate. But, again, we\u2019ll know a lot more tomorrow.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been \u201cinadequate\u201d and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.",
      "The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia ability to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.",
      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.",
      "BIS\u2019s budget, about $191 million, has remained essentially flat since 2010 when adjusted for inflation.",
      "\u201cWhile BIS\u2019 budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,\u201d Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report.",
      "Andrews added that with \u201cnecessary resources from Congress\u201d the agency would be \"better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.\u201d",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to an audit of Texas Instruments that showed the Russian military continued to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",
      "The committee's findings, Blumenthal said, suggest that Texas Instruments \u201cmissed clear warning signs\u201d that three companies in its distribution chain had been diverting products to Russia. Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",
      "The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years. They said there have been more than 150 fossils from the extinct elephant relative found statewide to date, about a third of them in Orange County in the same area as the recent find.",
      "Feranec said the newly unearthed jaw provides \u201ca unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.\u201d",
      "The fossils will be carbon-dated and analyzed to determine the mastodon\u2019s age, diet and habitat during its lifetime and will be put on public display sometime in 2025, museum officials said."

      "The federal government says that two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts and that one is likely to die from its injuries",
      "Two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts, and one is likely to die from its injuries, the federal government said.",
      "They are North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 400 and face existential threats from entanglement in gear and collisions with ships. An aerial survey found the whales swimming about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket on Dec. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "One of the whales is a juvenile that has a thick line that passes across its head and back and is likely to succumb to the injury, the agency said in a statement. The other whale is an adult female who biologists think has suffered a sublethal injury from the entanglement, NOAA said.",
      "NOAA said in a statement Tuesday that it would \u201cwork with authorized responders and trained experts to monitor the whales\u201d and that it will \u201cfurther document the entanglements and determine if entanglement responses will be possible.\u201d",
      "The news of the entangled whales follows the release of new data from researchers this fall showing a slight uptick in the whale's population. A group of researchers said two months ago that the population increased about 4% from 2020.",
      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",

      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",

      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have confirmed that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger.",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price soared nearly 24% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world\u2019s third-largest automaking group. Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

      "Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but his campaign said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "Trump's choice to head the Interior Department, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, has spoken openly about the need to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to healthcare to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said on Nov. 15, referring to artificial intelligence. \u201cAnd the AI that\u2019s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to consume more resources, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d",
      "Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",

But recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies, suggesting Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Cook\u2019s notoriously rocky relationship with the EU can be traced back to a 2016 ruling from Brussels in a tax case targeting Apple. Cook slammed the bloc\u2019s order for Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in Irish back taxes as \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d",

      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which billionaire Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. He recently said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term, while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",

      "Jurors took seven days to deliver their verdict against Nima Momeni in the April 4, 2023, death of Lee, a beloved tech mogul who was found staggering on a deserted downtown street, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. Lee, 43, later died at a hospital.",
      "Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times with a knife he took from his sister's kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her.",
      "But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and said he didn't realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even hurt.",
      "Jurors received the case, which started  Oct. 14, on Dec. 4.",
      "Momeni was charged with murder in the first degree, but jurors could have found him guilty of murder in the second degree or manslaughter.",
      "A conviction of murder in the second degree carries a sentence of 16 years to life in this case.",
      "Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023.",
      "In a 2023 press release announcing a murder charge against Momeni, the office of District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said he faced 26 years to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Lee had created mobile payment service Cash App and was the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin when he died. He had moved to Miami from the San Francisco Bay Area, where his ex-wife Krista Lee lives with their two children."

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",

The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Experts say it\u2019s easy to confuse drones and airplanes, especially at night",
      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is, \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away, and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a higher-pitched buzzing noise than that generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multicopter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "Johnson was asked about the Tesla CEO's post during an interview on \"Fox & Friends.\" He appeared to not worry about Musk's post influencing the ability of the funding bill to get through both chambers ahead of a partial government shutdown deadline at the end of the day Friday.",

      "WSDA Director Derek Sandison said in a statement he was \"incredibly proud of our team, which has dedicated years of hard work to safeguarding our state and the nation from this invasive threat to our native pollinators and agriculture.\"",
      "The public also played a large part in helping eradicate the pest by reporting sightings, officials said.",
      "\"Without the public's support for this effort, it is unlikely we would be announcing the eradication of northern giant hornet today,\" Sven Spichiger, WSDA's pest program manager, said in a statement. \"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports. And half of our confirmed detections came from the public. The people of Washington can be proud that we did this by working together.\"",
      "The northern giant hornet, which is native to Asian countries including China and Japan, was first detected in North America in August 2019 in British Columbia, Canada. It was confirmed in Washington state four months later when a resident in Whatcom County reported a dead specimen. That incident appeared to be a separate introduction originating from a different country than the British Columbia one, officials said.",
      "Four hornet nests found inside alder tree cavities in Whatcom County were eradicated between October 2020 and September 2021.",
      "Trapping efforts continued in Whatcom County through 2024, and no additional hornets have been detected in the area, WSDA said.",
      "A community member reported a \"suspicious hornet sighting\" in Kitsap County in October, though WSDA was unable to obtain the hornet to confirm the species, the department said. Traps placed in the area and public outreach did not yield any additional evidence or reports of suspected sightings, it said.",
      "\"All we can say is that the image appears to be a hornet of some kind. How it came to be in Kitsap County, we don't know,\" Spichiger said.",
      "WSDA said it will conduct trapping in the area in 2025 as a \"precautionary measure.\"",
      "The northern giant hornet could have posed a \"significant threat\" to honey bees and other pollinators had it become established in the U.S., officials said. The hornets can kill an entire honey bee hive in just 90 minutes. Their sting is also more painful than that of a typical honey bee.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Davidson said.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:21:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The state prosecution of Donald Trump on election interference charges in Georgia may be able to continue despite his impending inauguration, prosecutors signaled.",
    "story": [
      "The DA's office urged an appeals court to reject Trump's immunity claim.",
      "The state prosecution of Donald Trump on election interference charges in Georgia may be able to continue despite his impending inauguration, a lawyer for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis signaled in a court filing that urged an appeals court to reject the president-elect's request to throw out the case based on presidential immunity.",
      "The filing argued that Trump's lawyers failed to demonstrate why a state prosecution would be subject to the Department of Justice memorandum prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting presidents -- which was cited by special counsel Jack Smith when he wound down his federal cases against Trump -- or impede Trump's duties as president.",
      "\"Appellant does not specify or articulate how the appeal -- or indeed, any other aspect of this case -- will constitutionally impede or interfere with his duties once he assumes office,\" Fulton County Chief Senior Assistant District Attorney F. McDonald Wakeford wrote.",
      "\"The notice makes mention of these concepts without actually examining them or applying them to the present circumstances. In other words, Appellant has not done the work but would very much like for this Court to do so,\" the filing said.",
      "According to the filing, state prosecutors are not bound by the Department of Justice's policies, and past court decisions have not clearly established a precedent for state cases proceeding against a sitting president.",
      "\"Given these vague statements, to simply invoke the phrase 'federalism and comity concerns,' without more, offers nothing of substance,\" the filing said, accusing Trump's lawyer of making \"sweeping legal generalizations which are either misleading or oversimplified\" and providing \"a smattering of quotations that are alternately mischaracterized or stripped of context.\"",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. Four defendants subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "Wakeford, in his filing, urged the Georgia Court of Appeals to reject or ignore Trump's request to order the dismissal of the case, describing Trump's recent filing as nothing more than a \"decree.\"",
      "\"The notice thus fails to adequately notify this Court of anything except for the outcome that Appellant would prefer -- and expects -- to see,\" the filing said. \"Such a filing is best understood as a decree. Appellant has provided this Court with half a thought and gestured toward a smattering of constitutional principles, and as a result, he feels entitled to instruct this Court as to what its conclusions are expected to be.\"",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals took up Trump's case after trial Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis over her romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor, who was forced to resign from the case. Earlier this month, Trump's lawyer sent the court a notice requesting they order the trial judge to dismiss the case based on Trump's presidential immunity, which they argued applied to him as president-elect.",
      "Wakeford, in his filing, categorically denied the existence of president-elect immunity.",
      "\"While the courts' understanding of presidential immunity continues to evolve, 'president-elect immunity' obviously does not exist,\" the filing said.",
      "Wakeford also defended the integrity of the case against Trump, accusing the president-elect of using a \"familiar tactic\" when he argued the case is politically motivated.",
      "\"This case is thus the result of two separate grand juries and years of investigation, and any suggestion it is motivated by 'possible local prejudice' remains utterly unfounded,\" the filing said.",

      "Cindy Young, of New Hampshire, was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia of four misdemeanor charges earlier this year for joining the Capitol riot and was sentenced to four months incarceration as well as a term of probation -- which included conditions that bar her from entering Washington, D.C., without approval from her probation officer.",
      "Last week, Young requested permission to attend Trump's inauguration in a filing stating she \"poses no threat of danger to the community and she is not a risk of flight.\"",
      "Prosecutors with the Department of Justice, however, disputed that argument, pointing to repeated calls for \"retribution\" from Young in the years since Jan. 6 against jurors, judges and law enforcement involved in the Capitol breach cases.",
      "\"The risk Young presents to those in D.C. did not end with her exit from the Building,\" prosecutors said in their Wednesday filing, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "They further noted that Young has publicly \"mocked\" officers who were attacked by the pro-Trump mob, many of whom \"will, once again, be tasked in protecting the Capitol and Constitution on January 20, 2025.\"",
      "\"As such, her presence at an event staffed by law enforcement would not only present a danger but would cause further victimization for the officers who Young has publicly mocked,\" they said in the filing.",
      "Young is just one among a number of Jan. 6 defendants who have requested permission to attend Trump's inauguration.",
      "Retired Republican Rep. Chris Stewart invited Russell Taylor, a California man who pleaded guilty to a felony for participation in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, to the inauguration. However, Taylor also must receive permission from a judge to travel to Washington, D.C., after he \"repeatedly called for violence and a show of force\" to overturn the election and on Jan. 6 led a mob that overran a police line near the inaugural stage while wearing \"an exposed knife on top of a bullet proof chest plate and carrying bear spray,\" according to his sentencing memo.",
      "Taylor received credit from Judge Royce Lamberth, who oversaw his initial case and will determine his ability to travel Washington, for his agreement to enter into a plea deal, but he has not ruled yet whether he may attend the inauguration.",
      "Another Jan. 6 defendant, Eric Peterson, also requested permission to travel to Washington for the inauguration.",

      "Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at the president-elect's golf club in Florida, is now facing a state attempted murder charge in connection with a car accident that occurred following his arrest, officials announced Wednesday.",
      "The Florida Attorney General's Office said it has obtained an arrest warrant against Routh, who was apprehended on Interstate 95 in Martin County on Sept. 15 after he allegedly fled the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, authorities said.",
      "Following his arrest, an accident occurred that seriously injured a 6-year-old girl who was traveling with her family, according to Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.",

      "Southbound traffic was also stopped while authorities worked to clear Routh's vehicle, and traffic began to back up in both directions for miles, according to the affidavit.",

      "In total, the combined net worth of the wealthiest members of his administration could surpass $460 billion, including Department of Government Efficiency co-head Elon Musk -- whose net worth of more than $400 billion exceeds the GDP of mid-sized countries.",

Together, Trump's expected cabinet is worth at least $7 billion.",

      "Rizzuto briefly served as Trump's principal officer at the U.S. Consulate General in Bermuda in 2020 after his 2018 nomination to be ambassador to Barbados failed in the Senate.",

      "Republicans had initially promised to release bill text over the weekend with the aim of holding a vote early in the week, but outspoken criticism from within their ranks continually delayed negotiators from finalizing the legislation. While Speaker Mike Johnson expressed a preference to abide by waiting 72 hours after the bill text was posted to hold a vote, lawmakers are eager to get out of town for the holiday break, so it\u2019s very likely he might not honor that rule.",

      "After relying on Democrats for bipartisan support to pass the past five continuing resolutions, Johnson brushed off the criticism bubbling up within his ranks, stressing that the bill has not been released.",
      "\u201cI got a couple of friends who will just say that about any end of year funding measure,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is not an omnibus, OK? This is a small CR that we've had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not manmade disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\u201d",
      "Despite the growing tensions, Johnson expressed optimism that his speakership will overcome the challenges to buy the conference time until Republicans have unified control over Washington next year.",
      "\u201cI'm not worried about the speaker\u2019s vote. We're governing. Everybody knows we have difficult circumstances. We're doing the very best we can under those circumstances,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThese are the hard choices that lawmakers have to make, but we will get the job done, as we always do. We will. We will keep moving forward, and in January, we have a new lease on all this.\u201d",
      "With government funding set to lapse at the end of the week, Johnson was steadfast that the House must abide by a 72-hour rule, where the clock starts to tee up a vote once bill text is released.",
      "\u201cI believe in the 72-hour roll rule,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe're committed to all of that. We're going to take care of these obligations and get this done, and then we're going to go to work in unified government in the 119th Congress. It begins in January.\u201d",

      "Also meeting with senators on Tuesday was Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence. She planned to meet with two Democratic senators and five Republicans.",
      "Kennedy, who has come under fire for his opposition to vaccines and push to regulate farm-grown food, did not immediately discuss the topics he planned to bring up in his meetings, but several senators did share what their priorities are for the potential head of the HHS.",
      "And some indicated they were ready to push back on Kennedy's stances.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters outside a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that he did not agree with Kennedy on his agriculture positions and avoided commenting on his stance on abortion, but expressed optimism that Kennedy would \"support President Trump's policies\" on all fronts.",
      "\"So my working assumption is he will stay in his lane and do HHS policy,\" Hawley said, adding that he supports the polio vaccine.",
      "Kennedy's opinion on the polio vaccine has come under scrutiny after reports that his personal attorney Aaron Siri lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the vaccine. Sources told ABC News that Siri has been helping interview candidates for top health jobs in the incoming Trump administration. Siri, a partner at the law firm Siri & Glimstad, has also filed petitions seeking to pause the distribution of other vaccines, including Hepatitis B, and to revoke the emergency-use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Asked by ABC News if he planned to meet with outgoing Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kennedy replied, \"I hope so,\" as he left a meeting with Wyoming Republican John Barroso. McConnell, a polio survivor, criticized Siri's efforts to revoke the polio vaccine approval.",
      "Kennedy also told reporters he would \"probably\" meet with Democratic senators when he returns to Capitol Hill in January, though he said he wasn't yet sure which ones.",
      "Barroso said after his meeting that his \"understanding\" was that Kennedy is \"for the polio vaccine, supportive of it.\"",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., was also critical of Siri.",
      "Sen. Kennedy, who said he was \"looking forward to sitting down\" with RFK Jr. with an \"open mind,\" suggested to reporters outside a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the possible HHS secretary should fire his lawyer.",
      "\"I've got a completely open mind, but, but that kind of nonsense is not helpful,\" Kennedy said of the polio misinformation.",
      "\"I hope to be able to get to a position where I can support him enthusiastically. I'm looking forward to his confirmation hearings. We take those seriously,\" the senator added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., however, told reporters that Kennedy is a \"breath of fresh air\" who has his support.",
      "Tuberville, who has no medical background, brushed off concerns about Kennedy's views on vaccines and claimed, without any evidence or details, that they were not \"100% proven.\"",
      "\"He wants the parents to understand the good, the bad, and the ugly instead of just forcing parents to give vaccines to their kids,\" the senator said.",
      "Trump told reporters Monday that he was big believer in polio vaccine and vowed that it it was here to stay. He did, however, say he questioned vaccine mandates.",
      "Kennedy told reporters Monday that \"he was all for the polio vaccine.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he'd be meeting with Kennedy this week and looked forward to having discussions with him about vaccines and the agriculture industry.",
      "Abortion, Tillis said, was a \"legitimate question\" he was going to ask Kennedy about.",
      "\"I am consistently and unapologetically pro-life since I was a member of the state legislature,\" Tillis said.",
      "One Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, told reporters he has not had any meetings with Trump's potential nominees yet but that they should be vetted on abortion and vaccines, topics he called \"life and death issues.\" Durbin did not specifically mention Kennedy in his remarks.",
      "\"I think, in all fairness, we should take the measure of these nominees based on investigation, thorough FBI investigation, and what they have to say on the record under oath, and then make final judgment,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass also  expressed her disapproval of Kennedy, citing his anti-vaccine campaigns.",
      "\"Do you really want him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services?,\" she asked.",
      "Gabbard on Tuesday said she had a \"great\" meeting with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"This has been a great opportunity to meet with both Democrat and Republican senators and address any questions or concerns that they have and talk about the role,\" she said.",
      "Asked if she felt confident she had the votes to be confirmed, Gabbard said only that she \"looks forward to meeting with senators as we continue through this process.\"",
      "Fetterman has been leading the charge among Democrats meeting with Trump's nominees. In a post on X on Tuesday, he confirmed that he has met with Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump's selection for United Nations ambassador, and Pete Hegseth, his secretary of defense pick.",
      "\"I believe that it's appropriate and the responsibility of a U.S. Senator to have a conversation with President-Elect Trump's nominees,\" Fetterman posted on on X. \"My votes will come from an open-mind and an informed opinion after having a conversation with them.

    "story": [
      "Electors nationwide met Tuesday to cast their Electoral College votes.",
      "More than a dozen Republican officials accused of signing false certifications claiming Donald Trump had won their states' electoral votes in the 2020 election served as electors Tuesday, this time casting real votes for the president-elect.",
      "Thirteen alleged \"fake electors\" cast Electoral College votes in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan despite some of the officials still facing criminal charges from the last election. All have pleaded not guilty.",
      "As part of a process cemented in the Constitution as well as local laws, presidential electors across the country met Tuesday to cast their Electoral College votes, finalizing Trump's victory. Trump was projected to get 312 electoral votes, while Vice President Kamala Harris was projected to get 226.",
      "When the same process played out four years ago, with 306 electoral votes going to President Joe Biden, Trump and his allies allegedly organized false slates of electors in seven states as part of a scheme to overturn the election, according to a federal indictment charging Trump for his conduct. The former president pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed at the request of prosecutors after he was elected due to a Department of Justice policy of prohibiting criminal cases against sitting presidents.",
      "Mimicking the procedures followed by legitimate electors, the fake electors met on the same day as the real electors but allegedly signed false certifications declaring Trump the winner. Some of the electors are alleged to have knowingly signed the false certificates to influence the results, while others were misled by Trump and his allies, who said the certificates would only be used if Trump's lawsuits alleging widespread voter fraud were successful, according to the indictment.",
      "To determine overlap, ABC News reviewed the 2020 alleged fake elector certificates with the current list of electors released by either the state parties or state elections offices.",
      "In Nevada, two electors who were indicted on charges of falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada's electoral votes in 2020 participated as electors on Tuesday.",
      "Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford refiled his charges against six Republican fake electors last week after a judge dismissed the original case over a venue issue.",
      "In Michigan, six of the 2020 alleged fake electors returned to cast electoral votes on Tuesday. They have all pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges filed against them.",
      "The returning electors in Michigan are all facing felony charges over the alleged 2020 scheme and are awaiting a judge's ruling regarding whether the case will proceed to trial. They have all pleaded not guilty.",
      "In Pennsylvania, five of the certified presidential electors for 2024 are also people who signed the alleged fake elector certificate in 2020, according to a review of the 2020 certificates and names of 2024 electors from state officials. No criminal charges have been filed against them.",
      "Rex VanMiddlesworth, a constitutional legal expert and board member of the nonpartisan civic education and elections group Keep Our Republic, told ABC News that the participation of the so-called fake electors could reflect the current state of the Republican Party.",
      "\"I think it's evidence of how deeply ingrained in the Republican Party the belief that the election was stolen in 2020 -- and so it's not a disqualifier in the party. If anything, it's a badge of honor in the party to have stood up and fought the results of the 2020 election,\" he said.",
      "Following Biden being declared the winner in 2020, Trump filed lawsuits in several battleground states in an attempt to overturn the election results, arguing the election was \"stolen.\" However, though his lawsuits led to the 2020 election results being contested in court, his claims proved to be unfounded.",
      "VanMiddlesworth, who co-chairs the organization's anti-subversion task force, said there are relatively limited requirements to be an elector and that there likely are no legal issues against the electors participating again, even those who face charges. He emphasized as well that the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, passed in 2022, made the Electoral College process much clearer and in part has contributed to a smoother certification process this year.",
      "\"The job of the electors is to vote for whoever their state voted for,\" VanMiddlesworth said. \"Truthfully, their identity shouldn't affect that and should not matter.\"",
      "He added that \"there's nothing really untoward this year about what they're doing,\" as they are set to vote properly for whom their states voted for.",
      "Prosecutors in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin brought criminal cases against some of the alleged fake electors. Some of the states do not have returning electors, and these are the ones where criminal cases have been brought, though many of the cases have been beset by issues.",
      "The criminal case in Georgia against Trump and multiple defendants, including three alleged fake electors, has been stalled since June while an appeals court considers the former president's challenge to Judge Scott McAfee's decision not to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over a relationship with a prosecutor. The judge overseeing the Arizona fake electors case recused himself after he told fellow judges to respond to attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nevada fake electors case was dismissed earlier this year over a venue issue, though the state's attorney general refiled the case in a different county.",

      "\"I think we are telling them that we're here to govern,\" one Democrat said.",
      "Democrats have a plan to take back power in Washington back from Republicans in two years: work with them now.",
      "Democrats, who are already planning their comeback after being swept out of power in Washington last month, have said they'll oppose President-elect Donald Trump and his allies when their values collide but are open to cooperation on a range of issues, including immigration, federal spending and entitlements.",
      "The strategy marks a turnaround from 2017, when \"resistance\" to Trump was Democrats' rallying cry. But, some lawmakers and operatives said, it also marks a challenge to Republicans for bipartisanship at a time when narrow GOP congressional majorities will likely mandate some level of cooperation.",
      "\"People want to see government work, and we're going to hold Republicans accountable for whether they're willing to help move things forward for the American people. So, if they aren't, then absolutely, that will impact them at the ballot box,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., who led House Democrats' campaign arm this year and will do so again for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"I think we are telling them that we're here to govern,\" DelBene added. \"And I guess the question is, are they serious about governing?\"",
      "Republicans are cobbling together an aggressive agenda that would extend Trump-era tax cuts, implement strict border measures and more once they take office next month. The efforts will either be split into two measures or combined into one -- but Republicans' intention is to pass them in a way that wouldn't need to meet the 60-vote Senate filibuster rule.",
      "However, for the rest of the upcoming 119th Congress, Republicans will have a 220-215 House majority, once vacancies are filled and barring any absences, and only 53 seats in the Senate, short of the 60 needed to unilaterally pass most legislation.",
      "Democrats have already proposed potential areas of cooperation, even as they lick their wounds from a disappointing election and view Trump as anathema to many of their core beliefs.",
      "\"To win in 2026 and beyond, Democrats must focus on building an economic message centered on good-paying jobs and revitalizing manufacturing,\" California Rep. Ro Khanna said. \"But we have a responsibility now to try and find areas of common ground where we can deliver for Americans. I believe that starts with reducing the Pentagon's oversized defense budget while strongly opposing any cuts to programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\"",
      "\"We are very open to working with the Trump administration,\" added Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the Democratic Governors Association chair. \"But no doubt if there are things that they push us to do that that we think are wrong, legal, anything like that, we\u2019ll draw the line.\"",
      "That attitude will leave Democrats, especially in purple states and districts, with some leverage -- either to shape legislation, as they say they plan, or to hammer Republicans as obstinate, operatives said.",
      "It's very possible battleground Democrats are at times taken up on offers for bipartisanship or are made themselves to accept offers. Both chambers have their share of moderate Republicans, too, including Reps. Mike Lawler New York and David Valadao of California, and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "But each chamber also boasts some Republican hardliners who view bipartisanship as a four-letter word and a sign that a piece of legislation isn't conservative enough.",
      "\"This is how these battleground Democrats are anyway, but I think it will manifest itself in, 'Take me up on this offer, let's go.' And if you don't, then, 'OK, I can work with that, too,'\" said one Democratic strategist working on House races. \"I think for a battleground Democrat, it's a win-win approach. You have the possibility of working on a bill and a law which you can say, 'I delivered,' or you create receipts to bring back to voters to say, 'I kept on trying.'\"",
      "However, some Democrats warned, the party must balance cooperation, even if just offering it, with attacks.",
      "The base still finds Trump -- and Republicans in Congress with similar brands -- abhorrent, and the results in 2026 will be largely fueled by voter attitudes about the GOP's control in Washington.",
      "In 2018, Democrats took back the House in a wave largely fueled among their voters by antipathy for Trump. Capitalizing on that frustration could be key again, strategists told ABC News.",
      "\"The opportunity to work in a bipartisan way, to increase your own bipartisan credentials becomes very important,\" said Dan Sena, the executive director of House Democrats' campaign arm in 2018. \"I just think it's important at large for the caucus to pay attention to the fact that ultimately, in two years from now, the Republican trifecta is going to get a thumb up or a thumb down from the country, and that's ultimately going to dictate who has control of House.\"",
      "\"If I were the Democrats at large,\" Sena added, \"I would be pretty aggressive in holding the Republicans and then the Trump administration accountable.\"",
      "Still, nearly all Democrats agreed that the party should wage a two-pronged strategy, including both cooperation and criticism, and that each will go hand in hand when Democrats find themselves either in congressional majorities next month or having to deal with a Republican president even as they lead their states as governors.",
      "\"I think this openness to working with them is less that you are going to see actual collaboration, I think it's that people are trying to set themselves up to have some credibility in other spaces to be against stuff that they're doing,\" said one former Democratic House aide. \"It carries more weight and legitimacy if you're someone who's open minded to working with them, and then they take a hard right and you speak out.\"",
      "Either way, Democrats are ready to pounce heading into 2026, when both chambers of Congress and 36 governorships will be up for grabs.",
      "\"In politics, it's always the right move to extend a hand,\" said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist and former DGA staffer. \"And if somebody chooses to slap you in the face instead, you better make sure you catch it on camera.\"",

      "\"Corporate America got greedy and what they decided to do is find the cheapest labor in the world,\" Biden said. \"Send the product they were going to make to that state, that place, that nation and import the product back.\"",

      "\"It's just beginning to sink in,\" Biden said, speaking of the decades-long policy plans he put in place to invest in technology and infrastructure. \"I think that it's hard to tell someone about the hundreds of thousands of jobs we created with the CHIPS and Science Act when they haven't seen it yet.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that prices are still higher than before the pandemic, including for basic goods like milk and eggs, which he said are \"just starting to change.\"",

      "That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d as he campaigned alongside Donald Trump caught her attention. She liked the questions Kennedy raised about the role of processed foods in America's obesity epidemic.",

      "Kennedy's talk of healthy foods is what captured the attention of Natalie Moralez, a 32-year-old engineer in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who identifies as an independent.",
      "She likes his promises to take on powerful companies. And she's eager to see him challenge the ingredients they use in the food she finds on supermarket shelves.",
      "\u201cEven just buying foods from the grocery store, like what else is in there?\u201d Moralez said. \u201cThat\u2019s my main concern, and hopefully he can figure out what the underlying issues are and see if we can do better.\u201d",

About 6 in 10 Democrats \u201cstrongly disapprove\u201d of the pick, the December poll found. That's a higher share of disapproval than other high-profile picks such as Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary or Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "Kennedy started his career as an environmental lawyer and won big lawsuits against companies over the chemicals used in weed killers and heavy metal smelters.",
      "But in recent years, he's attracted a sizable and loyal following over his claims that vaccines, recommended and championed by the nation's public health agencies, are dangerous. That's despite decades of research, laboratory testing and real-world use that shows childhood vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d Kennedy said on a podcast in July 2023. During a Fox News interview the same year, he said he believes a repeatedly discredited idea that vaccines can cause autism. In recent days, Trump has increasingly suggested that the link between autism and vaccines should be studied \u2014 although decades of research has already concluded there is no connection between the two.",

      "About one-quarter said the government\u2019s current involvement on this is \u201cabout right,\u201d and only about 2 in 10 wanted the government to be less involved. But parents of school-age children were somewhat more likely to support a smaller government role: Roughly 3 in 10 parents of children under 18 wanted the government less involved, compared with about 2 in 10 voters without children under 18.",

      "A similar share wanted the government more involved, and about 3 in 10 said its involvement was about right. Roughly 4 in 10 Trump voters who are parents of children under 18 said they want the government less involved in ensuring children are vaccinated, while about one-third said they wanted it more involved.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "People who voted in the presidential race this November held divided views on Kennedy, according to AP VoteCast.",
      "Kennedy had dropped out of the presidential race by that point, throwing his support behind Trump, but remained on the ballot in some states.",
      "About 4 in 10 voters had a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Kennedy, and roughly 4 in 10 had a very or somewhat unfavorable view. Slightly more than 1 in 10 did not know enough about Kennedy to have an opinion.",
      "Republican voters \u2014 about two-thirds \u2014 were more likely to hold a favorable view of Kennedy, much higher than the roughly 2 in 10 Democrats who viewed him positively. Meanwhile, about 7 in 10 Democrats had a negative opinion of Kennedy, with about half saying they had a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d view.",

      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "A report by CNN's Clarissa Ward about a freed Syrian prisoner provided some dramatic scenes, but the network has since found that it apparently wasn't all that it appeared",
      "CNN is acknowledging that a gripping story it aired last week depicting a Syrian man being let free from a Damascus prison after the fall of dictator Bashar Assad's regime was not what it seemed.",
      "The network said that it has since found out that the man shown in correspondent Clarissa Ward's report, which initially aired on Dec. 11, apparently gave a false identity.",
      "\u201cThis moment captures the complexity of the situation in Syria,\u201d CNN's Jake Tapper said on Tuesday.",
      "In the report, Ward was being escorted by a Syrian rebel through a prison that had been run by the Syrian Air Force intelligence services and emptied since the Assad government fell. That's what they thought, at least \u2014 until they came upon a padlocked door.",
      "The rebel guard shot the lock to open the door to a cell, where they found a man hiding under a blanket. Clearly bewildered and shaking, he gulped water when offered, said \u201coh, God, there is light!\u201d when led outdoors and hugged the guard when told of the change in power.",
      "He told Ward that his name was Adel Ghurbal from the Syrian city of Homs, and that he was a civilian who had been arrested three months ago and spent time in three different prisons.",
      "But a few days later, a Syrian fact-checking site, Verify-Sy, said that the man was really Salama Mohammad Salama, and that he was a former intelligence officer for the Assad government. CNN obtained a photo of Salama and, through facial recognition software, found that it was a better than 99 percent chance that was the same man from their report, the network said.",
      "Ward said Tuesday that CNN didn't know why he had been arrested. Verify-Sy reported that Salama, who had a reputation for extortion, had been thrown in prison because of a dispute with a superior officer over sharing some of the profits, she said. CNN has been unable to confirm that or locate Salama, she said.",
      "A CNN spokeswoman said that no one outside of the network knew ahead of time of the plans to visit the prison. CNN reported the scene as it unfolded, the network said.",
      "It was arresting video, and the temptation to air Ward's story was obvious. While CNN did due diligence and research in uncovering the problem after the fact, the question is whether the network could have, or should have, done more to verify the prisoner's story before it was used.",
      "\u201cI think we need to be humble about the challenges,\u201d Ward said on the air Tuesday. \u201cIt is a chaotic atmosphere, there is a huge amount of flux, and it is very difficult to verify information in real time on the ground ... Stories take unexpected turns. We have to continue to report them without fear or favor, but it is immensely challenging in this environment and I think we need to be transparent about that.\u201d",

She was sent to Provo Canyon School for 11 months at age 17 where she says she was abused mentally and physically, recalling that staff members would beat her, force her to take unknown pills, watch her shower and send her to solitary confinement without clothes as punishment. The 43-year-old said the treatment was so \u201ctraumatizing\u201d that she has suffered nightmares and insomnia for years.",
      "Details of the abuse were also chronicled in a documentary she released, titled \u201cThis is Paris\u201d that was released in September 2020.",
      "The legislation passed this week would establish an interagency work group under Department of Health & Human Services that would bring greater transparency around treatment of youth in these programs, particularly when staff use restraints and seclusion rooms as forms of punishment. Hilton's advocacy has helped changed laws to protect minors in at least eight states, including in Hilton's home state of California, where similar legislation will go into effect on Jan. 1."

      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday that would permanently give tax relief on tips and cars, measures that his Republican administration has said would give money back to middle- and lower-income workers",
      "RICHMOND -- Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed a state budget plan on Wednesday to provide tax relief on tips and cars, measures his Republican administration touted as giving money back to middle- and lower-income workers.",
      "The proposal, which would amend the final year of the state's two-year budget cycle, also seeks to boost funding for schools, maternal health and disaster relief. An adviser for Youngkin said ahead of his speech that the proposed adjustments are fueled by surplus funds coming out of fiscal year 2024.",
      "\u201cWe reopened Virginia\u2019s economy after a global pandemic, all while delivering surplus after surplus after surplus,\u201d Youngkin said in a presentation to the General Assembly\u2019s money committees. \"And as a result of our work together, Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading and Virginia is winning.\u201d",
      "Budget plans introduced by governors typically undergo revisions by the money committees before lawmakers vote. And with Democrats poised to keep control of both General Assembly chambers after special elections in January, Youngkin's priorities may likely be contingent on bipartisanship.",
      "Democratic House of Appropriations Chair Luke Torian said on Wednesday that none of Youngkin's proposed amendments were off the table, clarifying that the state had roughly $2 billion to $3 billion in surplus funds. He also said that the state would have to be strategic in its spending, particularly if its economy takes a dip in years to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll go over the governor\u2019s presentation and we\u2019ll see what is applicable \u2014 what we can do, what we can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.",
      "Youngkin said $1.1 billion could be deposited into a car tax relief fund from the state's surplus, which would pre-fund its first three years. In his speech, he envisioned a permanent, refundable income tax credit of up to $150 for people earning under $50,000 a year, and up to $300 for joint filers making under $100,000 annually.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea: the local car tax,\u201d he said.",
      "He also pushed for Virginia to eliminate taxes on tips, which would make the Old Dominion the first state in the U.S. to take such action. Youngkin argued the proposal would save $70 million, though some Democrats questioned whether such fiduciary relief would be feasible.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that I read the legislation, there was no definition really, of what tips are, given that this is ground that hasn\u2019t been plowed before,\u201d Democratic Del. Vivian Watts said in the joint committee meeting. \u201dI look forward to a discussion before we act on any such legislation of how we define tips.\"",
      "Echoing nationwide concerns surrounding immigration, Youngkin emphasized he would also like to cut off funds toward local entities that do not fully comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 an initiative he said would weed out sanctuary cities.",
      "In his speech, Youngkin said local law enforcement, sheriffs and jail directors should be required to notify federal authorities of migrants\u2019 arrest 48 hours before their release. His proposal comes after the governor has gone on national news networks, lamenting illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cThis should be common sense. I don\u2019t think anybody wants an illegal immigrant who has committed a serious and violent crime to be released back in the community,\u201d Youngkin said.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s proposal to deny funds to jurisdictions that ignore immigration detainers would likely be held up by Democrats. But as lawmakers roll into an election year in 2025, immigration may be a key issue to voters across the state.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:34:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u2019s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses.",
      "But with inflation pressures still elevated and with concern that President-elect Donald Trump's policies could fuel inflation, the Fed indicated Wednesday that it's likely to cut rates more gradually in 2025 than it had projected three months ago. The policymakers now envision two rate cuts next year, not the four they predicted back in September.",
      "The result is that borrowers who have been hoping for much-lower-rate loans could be disappointed. Loan rates may barely budge if the Fed sticks with its plan to cut its key short-term rate only twice next year.",
      "\u201cThis could be the last cut for a while,\u201d said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. \u201cBecause the upcoming Trump administration\u2019s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting.\u201d",
      "Depending on the specific proposals the Trump administration manages to enact, the Fed could hold off on any additional cuts until March or even later.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cAnother rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t amount to much for those with debt,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cA quarter-point reduction may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment. It certainly doesn\u2019t change the fact that the best thing cardholders can do in 2025 is to take matters into their own hands when it comes to high interest rates.\u201d",
      "The average annual percentage rate on a new credit card offer, according to LendingTree, is 24.43%. In September, it was 24.92%. Further modest declines in that rate, Schulz said, are possible in the next few months.",
      "But, he cautioned, \u201cAnyone expecting card rates to go from awful to amazing overnight because of the Fed is going to be sorely disappointed.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said that particularly for credit card users who carry debt from month to month, \u201cIt\u2019s a drop in the bucket for anyone feeling pressure from high rates.\u201d",
      "For savers, returns on high-yield accounts have dropped, too, in tandem with the Fed's rate cuts. So while these accounts are not quite as attractive as they had been, they might still be worth investigating if you haven\u2019t shopped for one recently. Some of these accounts offer yields at or near 5%.",
      "\u201cYes, you\u2019ve missed the peak rates seen a few months ago,\" Schulz said. \u201cBut even at these levels, they\u2019re still likely higher than what you\u2019ll find at a traditional bank.\u201d",
      "Though the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, it does influence them. Long-term mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is driven in part by the market's outlook for inflation and the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "That means that, at least indirectly, cuts to the Fed\u2019s key rate can put downward pressure on mortgage rates, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.",
      "\u201cCase in point, turmoil in the bond market has caused mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down over the last month,\u201d Channel said. \u201cAfter peaking at 6.84% for the week ending Nov. 21, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has since come down to 6.60%.\u201d",
      "Despite this decline, this average remains well above the 2024 low of 6.08%, back in late September.",
      "For people with fixed mortgages, their rate won\u2019t change unless they refinance their mortgage or sell and move someplace else.",
      "The effects of the Fed\u2019s half-point rate cut in September and its quarter-point cut in November have largely been passed through to auto loans, which fell on average from a peak of 7.3% in July to 6.8% last month, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com.",
      "The half-point drop, he said, has helped more people afford new vehicles, helping to spur a buying spree in November. But the increased demand, which Drury attributed largely to some optimism over Trump's election, also boosted average prices and monthly payments to record levels.",
      "\u201cOptimism and having money on hand to do these things has definitely green-lit some people\u2019s spending, when other folks are more conservative with how much they\u2019re spending,\u201d he said.",
      "The average amount that a car buyer financed rose to $42,160, and average monthly payments hit $753, according to Edmunds data.",
      "Edmunds expects only a modest increase in auto sales next year, from just under 16 million vehicles this year to 16.2 million in 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee is in a balancing act \u2014 cut (rates) too much and risk inflation resurgence; cut too little and continue to squeeze the labor market,\" said Renter of NerdWallet.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reiterating \u201cthe familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut \u2018skip\u2019 at the January meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will favor a gradual easing of policy to observe how the economy and inflation behave, indicating an extremely \u2018data-dependent\u2019 approach,\u201d Daco said.",
      "\u201cRemember,\" Channel said, \u201cthe Fed is designed to pivot relatively quickly should something unexpected happen. If the economy shows serious signs of deterioration, we could see bigger and more frequent cuts over the next 12 months.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, he cautioned, \"if inflation rears its head and spikes once more, (rate) cuts might be moved off the table.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Rushing to prevent a Christmastime government shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson scrambled Wednesday to salvage a stopgap measure to keep federal offices running into March despite an onslaught of opposition from hard-right conservatives led by President-elect Donald Trump -ally billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Rank-and-file lawmakers decried the massive 1,500-page bill over its increased spending \u2014 which includes their first pay-raises in more than a decade \u2014 a shock after one of the most unproductive chaotic session in modern times. A number of Republicans were waiting for Trump to signal whether they should vote yes or no.",
      "\u201cThis should not pass,\u201d Musk posted on his social media site X in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.",
      "The outcome comes as no surprise for Johnson, who like other Republican House speakers before him, has been unable to convince his majority to go along with the routine needs of federal government operations, which they would prefer to slash.",
      "Even the addition of much-needed disaster aid, some $100.4 billion in the aftermath of hurricanes Helene and Milton and other natural calamities that ravaged states this year, plus $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers failed to win over the budget-slashing GOP.",
      "It all shows just how hard it will be for Republicans next year, as they seize control of the House, Senate and White House, to unify and lead the nation. And it underscores how much Johnson and the GOP leaders must depend on Trump\u2019s blessing to see any legislative package over the finish line.",
      "The president-elect had yet to weigh in on what the lawmakers should do, but Musk, who is heading the his new Department of Government Efficiency was leading the charge against it.",
      "Musk even warned that \u201cAny member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!\u201d",
      "It's not an idle threat coming from Musk, the world's richest man, who helped bankroll Trump's victory and can easily use his America PAC to make or break political careers.",
      "Democrats, who negotiated the final product with Johnson and Senate GOP leadership, will be expected to provide enough support to help Johnson ensure passage, as is often the case on big bills. Federal government funding runs out at midnight Friday.",
      "\u201cThe sooner Congress acts, the better,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said as he opened the upper chamber. \u201cAs always, bipartisan cooperation must lead the way \u2013 we can\u2019t have last minute delays or grandstanding.\u201d",
      "The final package extends existing government programs and services at their current operating levels for a few more months, through March 14, 2025.",
      "The stopgap measure is needed because Congress has failed to pass its annual appropriations bills to fund all the various agencies in the federal government, from the Pentagon and national security apparats, to the health, welfare, transportation and other routine domestic services. When the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, Congress simply punted the problem by passing a temporary funding bill that expires Friday.",
      "But the inches-thick bill goes beyond routine funding and tacks on several other measures that lawmakers are trying to push through to passage before the end of this congressional session, especially as some elected officials will not be returning in the new year.",
      "And then there's the pay-raise.",
      "Some lawmakers expressed concern that the bill turns off a pay freeze provision that was included in the previous short-term spending measure. That change could allow a maximum pay adjustment of 3.8% or $6,600 in 2025, bringing their annual pay to $180,600, according to a Congressional Research Service report.",
      "Members of Congress last got a raise in 2009, when the salary was increased 2.8% to $174,000 annually. If member pay had not been frozen since 2009, salaries would be about $217,900.",
      "When adjusted for inflation, salaries have decreased about 31% from 2009, the research report said.",
      "Among other provisions in the package, there\u2019s full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when struck by a cargo ship that reported losing power just before the crash. Federal taxpayers will be reimbursed through proceeds from insurance payments and litigation.",
      "And there's also a provision to transfer the land that is the site of the old RFK Stadium from the federal government to the District of Columbia, which could potentially lead to a new stadium for the Washington Commanders.",
      "On the health care front, the legislation seeks to extend coverage of telehealth appointments for Medicare enrollees and rein in how much money pharmacy benefits managers \u2014 the companies that negotiate how and what drugs are covered by insurance plans \u2014 make off those deals.",
      "The bill also includes provisions focused on countering China, including expanding on President Biden's executive order that seeks to restrict investments into countries that pose a national security threat to the United States. Blocking China\u2019s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats."

      "SCOTCHTOWN, N.Y. -- Scholars are hailing the discovery of a fossilized mastodon jaw discovered by a man who spotted two giant teeth while gardening at his upstate New York home this year.",
      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years. They said there have been more than 150 fossils from the extinct elephant relative found statewide to date, about a third of them in Orange County in the same area as the recent find.",
      "Feranec said the newly unearthed jaw provides \u201ca unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.\u201d",
      "The fossils will be carbon-dated and analyzed to determine the mastodon\u2019s age, diet and habitat during its lifetime and will be put on public display sometime in 2025, museum officials said."

    "summary": "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Democrats should think less about partisan politics and more about meeting people&rsquo;s needs",
    "story": [
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Democrats should think less about partisan politics and more about meeting people\u2019s needs",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that Democrats should be thinking less about partisan politics and more about meeting people's everyday needs as they chart a comeback strategy after last month's crushing election losses.",
      "Beshear, who has won three statewide elections in deeply red Kentucky and has been mentioned as a potential contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, said the party should work on things like good-paying jobs, health care, schools, roads and bridges and public safety.",
      "\u201cThese are the core areas the American people need help on, and that\u2019s where we as Democrats should be, but that\u2019s where every Republican should be, too,\u201d Beshear said during a sit-down interview at the Kentucky Capitol. \u201cAnd just imagine, if we spent most of our time working on all that, we\u2019d argue a lot less. And the American people would be a lot better off.\u201d",
      "Beshear, who was recently chosen as chair-elect of the Democratic Governors Association for 2026, when a majority of states will elect governors, said he hoped to be \u201ca reasonable, common-sense, common-ground voice\u201d for the party. That should overshadow talk of whether the party should shift more to the political right, left or center, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party needs to stay laser focused on people\u2019s everyday needs,\" he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re political at all. So I don\u2019t get into the right, left or center. But focusing on jobs, focusing on health care, focusing on the roads and bridges we drive every day, public education and public safety. Those are the core concerns that if somebody\u2019s worried about it, they don\u2019t get to anything else. They don\u2019t get to the partisanship.\u201d",
      "Beshear's rise in national politics accelerated with his reelection victory in 2023, a year before voters decided to return Republican Donald Trump to the White House and give the GOP control of Congress. Beshear served one term as state attorney general before his first election as governor in 2019.",
      "Beshear was in the running to be Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate this summer but lost out to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Assessing his party's loss of the White House, Beshear avoided any criticism of Harris, saying she made the best decisions she could and tried hard to win.",
      "He quickly pivoted to the work ahead for Democrats, and his role in the party's comeback efforts.",
      "\u201cI believe that what this election showed is that many people, at the end of the day, vote with their gut about who they think will make their lives better,\" Beshear said.",
      "Beshear, whose term ends in 2027, mostly sidestepped questions about his future, saying he's focused on his job as governor and his national role in getting more Democratic governors elected. The term-limited governor again ruled out a U.S. Senate run in 2026, when Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's seat will be on the ballot. McConnell, who is stepping down from his leadership post at the end of the year, has not said whether he will seek another term.",
      "Beshear had some ideas on what Democrats should look for in their next presidential nominee in 2028.",
      "\u201cI think the next Democratic nominee should be a pragmatist that is about getting things done, getting real results,\" he said. \u201cA track record of showing people that they can help lower their bills or help them make more money to pay them. Somebody who\u2019s got a track record on improving the infrastructure of this country. With plans, but also results, that show that health care can be more affordable. Someone that is pro-public education and someone that understands that people don\u2019t just need to be safer, they need to feel safer in their communities.\u201d",
      "A constant theme of Beshear's governorship has been Kentucky's record pace of economic development since he's been in office. The state's Republican supermajority legislature says the record private-sector investments stem from its business-friendly policies.",
      "Beshear also has focused on infrastructure improvements, expanded health care and support for public schools. He led opposition to a ballot measure rejected by voters that would have allowed state lawmakers to allocate public tax dollars to support students attending private or charter schools.",
      "The governor has feuded with Republican lawmakers on a number of issues, including GOP efforts to restrict abortion rights and ban gender-affirming health care for transgender young people. GOP lawmakers have easily swept aside Beshear's vetoes.",
      "Beshear is one of several Democratic governors who are the subject of early speculation as potential contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2028.",
      "If he succeeds in helping elect more Democratic governors in 2026, the party's bench of potential candidates for national office will grow, Beshear said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cGovernors get things done,\u201d he said. \"You can\u2019t be overly ideological because you\u2019ve got to get results for your people. So my goal is to elect a lot more Democratic governors who will work everyday for the people of their states. And if I do that well, there will be a lot more names that are out there for the future.\u201d"

      "Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small has been indicted on a witness tampering charge for allegedly asking his teenage daughter to recant claims she made to law enforcement officials that he abused her",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. has been indicted on a witness tampering charge for allegedly asking his daughter to recant claims she made to law enforcement officials that he abused her, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "The Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office said the indictment was handed down Tuesday by a grand jury.",
      "The indictment asserts that in September 2024, six months after being charged with abusing her, Small asked her to do him a favor and \u201ctwist up\u201d the story she told police about alleged abuse.",
      "Small, 50, is accused of asking his daughter to claim that a head injury she sustained on Jan. 13 occurred when she tripped and fell in her bedroom. The mayor was previously charged with striking her several times in the head with a broom during that incident, causing her to lose consciousness.",
      "Small denies he abused his daughter. He has called the situation a private family matter that does not rise to the level of a crime.",
      "On Wednesday, his attorney, Edwin Jacobs, called the indictment \u201canother clumsy effort by the county prosecutor to intrude into the private and confidential conversations among members of Marty Small's family.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt proves the old saying of many lawyers, judges and prosecutors that you can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs added that the girl continues to live at home with her parents.",
      "The mayor's wife, La'Quetta Small, who is the city's superintendent of schools, is charged with child endangerment related to the original case. She, too, denies any wrongdoing.",
      "The couple appeared in court on Oct. 10 and pleaded not guilty to the original charges. Both are charged with child endangerment, and Marty Small is also charged with assault and making terroristic threats.",
      "Authorities said both parents emotionally abused and hit the girl, who was 15 to 16 years old, in December and January, at least once to the point of unconsciousness.",
      "Prosecutors filed court documents in April saying the Smalls disapproved of their daughter\u2019s boyfriend, who secretly used a video chat to record an alleged instance of the mayor physically and verbally assaulting the girl.",
      "An affidavit from prosecutors says the girl at one point acknowledged making up the accusations because she was angry her parents wouldn\u2019t let her go out with friends. But in other sections, the document includes detailed claims by the girl that the abuse was real, and it said she photographed bruises and sent them to her boyfriend, who shared them with detectives.",
      "The office of Atlantic County Prosecutor William Reynolds cited evidence including recordings of interactions between the girl and her parents; her statements to police, school workers, a therapist and state child welfare investigators; and messages she sent to friends saying she did not feel safe at home.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin police did not plan any public updates Wednesday on the extremely rare religious school shooting that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six others, a day after the city\u2019s mayor chastised reporters and urged them to leave victims alone.",
      "Police have been tight-lipped about why a 15-year-old student at Abundant Life Christian Christian School shot and killed a fellow student and teacher on Monday, before shooting herself. Two other students who were shot remained in critical condition on Wednesday.",
      "Madison\u2019s police chief released the name of the shooter, Natalie \u201cSamantha\u201d Rupnow, hours after the shooting on Monday. But police have yet to release the names of the two people she killed.",
      "A spokesperson for UW Health said she had no update on the three patients who were transferred to the hospital Monday. A spokesperson for the Dane County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office declined to release any information about the number of autopsies it was performing or the identity of the victims.",
      "Tension over police not releasing additional information spilled over into a news conference on Tuesday, where Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes left without taking questions. Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway grew increasingly terse in her responses as reporters asked questions she could not answer.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely none of y\u2019alls business who was harmed in this incident,\u201d Rhodes-Conway said. \u201dPlease, have some human decency and respect for the people who lost loved ones or were injured themselves or whose children were injured. Just have some human decency, folks. Leave them alone. Let them grieve. Let them recover. Let them heal. Don\u2019t feed off their pain. We\u2019ll share what we can when we can and not before that.\u201d",
      "Tamrin Olden, a former police department spokesperson in California whose company provides communications training for law enforcement, said she advises departments to give routine updates with factual information after critical incidents and avoid unnecessarily delaying the release of information. She said that communications errors can cause frustration in the community, undermine the public's trust and compound the underlying tragedy.",
      "\u201cYour credibility gets tarnished and the incident sometimes gets remembered for these things rather than being remembered and honoring the victims, which is where the focus should be,\u201d she said.",
      "The police department has had to correct some key misstatements since Monday, including that three and not five people had died and that a second-grade teacher, not a second-grade student, called 911.",
      "Paul Bucher, the former Waukesha County district attorney who was involved in a number of high-profile cases, said the media has unrealistic expectations about how quickly officials should release information in high-profile incidents. His cases have included prosecuting former Green Bay Packers star tight end Mark Chmura for sexual assault in 2000 and being part of the team that dealt with the aftermath of a mass shooting at a church gathering in Brookfield in 2005 that left seven people dead.",
      "\u201cThe government is fed up with the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no obligation to disclose anything to you at all. Based on the mayor\u2019s statement, \u2018this is not y\u2019all\u2019s business,\u2019 that\u2019s pretty indicative that they\u2019ve had it.\u201d",
      "But Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council President Bill Lueders, a longtime Madison journalist, said Wednesday that authorities should be more transparent with the facts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a problem that so little information has been released. I do not accept that this is necessary to protect the integrity of the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public has a right to know.\u201d",
      "Lueders said a state constitutional amendment that protects the rights of crime victims, including their privacy, is likely contributing to the delayed release of the identities of the shooting victims. He said the law does not prohibit their release but encourages prior notification of family members.",
      "Community members have been wrestling with grief since the shooting that came on the final week of classes before Christmas break.",
      "Several hundred people gathered outside the Wisconsin State Capitol for a vigil Tuesday night to honor those slain, with some passing candles to each other and standing close against the winter chill. It was one of several vigils held since the shooting.",
      "The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas.",
      "But it stands out because school shootings by teenage females have been extremely rare in the U.S., with males in their teens and 20s carrying out the majority of them, said David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting Database.",
      "Emily Salisbury, an associate sociology professor at the University of Utah, studies criminology and gender. She said that females typically turn their anger on themselves because American culture has taught them that women don\u2019t hurt people, resulting in eating disorders, self-harm and depression. It\u2019s difficult to speculate without knowing all the facts in Rupnow\u2019s case, Salisbury said, but a girl resorting to the level of violence she displayed suggests she experienced severe trauma or suffered violence herself.",
      "\u201cIt takes more provocation, more instigation for girls and women to become violent,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high probability she experienced some sort of violence in her life that can lead to serious mental illness.\u201d",
      "Online court records show no criminal cases against her father, Jeffrey Rupnow, or her mother, Mellissa Rupnow. They are divorced and shared custody of their daughter, but she primarily lived with her father, according to court documents. Divorce records indicate that Natalie was in therapy in 2022, but don\u2019t say why.",
      "Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school \u2014 prekindergarten through high school \u2014 with approximately 420 students.",
      "Salisbury said the public shouldn\u2019t assume that the school\u2019s religious teachings mean its students are above bullying and ostracizing each other.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re children,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cAs much as those (religious) values may be taught or discussed in the classroom in the culture of that school, kids are online all the time. Kids create their own culture through social media.\u201d",

      "South Carolina moved in 2018 to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. The organization uses Medicaid funding for family planning health services rather than abortions, but Gov. Henry McMaster said any public money sent there \u201cresults in the subsidy of abortion.\u201d",
      "Medicaid does not pay for abortion except in cases when a pregnant woman\u2019s life is at risk or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.

As of that evening, police in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley didn\u2019t know whether the teen was a suspect or a victim in the case. Due to his injuries \u201cthere are some challenges in communicating with him and finding out more information,\" spokesperson Roseanne Vainuku said.",
      "Authorities did not believe there was a suspect at large and that the crime was \u201cisolated to this home,\u201d Vainuku said at a news conference Tuesday. Police have said they expect to provide more information Wednesday.",
      "A relative of the family called police on Monday night to report being unable to contact a woman who lived at the home for several days, despite usually having regular contact with her, Vainuku said.",
      "Officers looked in windows and spoke to neighbors, but did not find any indications of an emergency or a crime so they asked the family member to keep in contact, she said.",
      "\u201cAs we know, adults have the right to do what they want to do and they don't have to communicate with their family members if they don't want to,\u201d Vainuku said. \u201cSo that is kind of a tricky balance in protecting people's rights to do what they want to do but also acknowledging the concerns of family members.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:25 -0500",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

      "Hecker was ordained as an archdiocesan priest in 1958 and left a trail of red flags, including his own admission and an undisputed complaint of child molestation leveled against him in the late 1980s, court records indicate. Hecker left the ministry in 2002.",

      "The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Hebert has long been open about his story.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the Archdiocese of New Orleans is morally bankrupt, not financially bankrupt,\" Hebert wrote in a letter to a federal judge.",
      "New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond, who has rebuffed calls from survivors of clergy sexual assaults to step down, said in an emailed statement that he hoped survivors of Hecker's abuse would find \u201csome closure and some sense of peace in his sentencing.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn behalf of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, we offer our sincere and heartfelt apologies to the survivors for the pain Hecker has caused them to endure for decades,\" Aymond said.",

      "Inflation, which measures the pace of price increases, stood at 2.7% in the US in November - up from 2.6% a month earlier.",

      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",
      "\"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\"",

      "Sir Alan spoke as a long-running inquiry into what is considered one of the most widespread miscarriages in British justice heard final submissions.",
      "Lawyers acting for sub-postmasters told the inquiry on Monday the Post Office's \"cruel\" and \"malignant culture\" had \"destroyed the innocent\".",

      "On Monday, Edward Henry KC, representing victims, said: \"The truth is this tragedy is not about an IT system. Horizon did not destroy the innocent \u2013 the malignant culture of the Post Office did.\"",
      "\"People were ruined, people were bankrupted, people were imprisoned, there were atrocious miscarriages of justice, people died,\" he said.",

      "Sir Alan said that his most recent offer on redress, which he has rejected, was worth a third of his original claim. The first redress offer was for one sixth of his original claim, he said.",
      "His claim was now with Sir Ross Cranston, a former High Court Judge, who is the Independent Reviewer of the GLO Post Office scheme, he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 21:47:58 GMT",
    "summary": "Masayoshi Son said he would invest $100bn in the US, and others could follow during Trump's second term.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump pitching the US as a great place for business,  firms around the world are figuring out how to answer his call.",
      "Japanese tech billionaire Masayoshi Son, a colourful character known as much for his major flops as his big accomplishments, presented one path on Monday, appearing with Trump at a press conference and pledging to invest $100bn (\u00a379bn) over four years and create 100,000 jobs.",
      "\"He's a great negotiator,\" the CEO said, laughing on stage as Trump pressed him to double his commitment.",
      "But plenty of questions remain about Mr Son's venture, especially in light of the lack of details he provided and the record of similar investments during Trump's first term.",
      "Mr Son has previously discussed the opportunity he sees in artificial intelligence, and Bloomberg reported in February that he was planning a $100bn chip venture.",
      "But his Softbank Group had only about a third of that, $30bn, in cash earlier this year and its global reputation has taken large hits after previous bets, such as a major investment in co-working firm WeWork, imploded.",
      "With the cameras rolling at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Son avoided giving specifics about how he would fund his promise.",
      "Nor did Trump demand details, casting the pledge primarily as a sign of a wider renewal in business optimism, which has been reported in surveys in recent weeks.",
      "\"This historic investment is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America's future,\" the president-elect said.",
      "Trump has indicated that when he returns to the White House he plans to use the bully pulpit to court foreign investment.",
      "His campaign promises to slash both taxes and regulations have already boosted Wall Street and charged up big business to pursue large-scale ambitions.",
      "Specifically, Trump has said he would cut taxes for companies that make products in the US and speed approvals for firms investing $1bn or more.",
      "Investors expect him to green-light takeovers and pull back on enforcing antitrust laws, as well.",
      "Still, there are concerns about Trump's campaign promises to crack down on immigration, which could affect the workforce, and raise tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. On top of that, he has discussed rolling back manufacturing and energy incentives put in place by President Joe Biden, which some investors like.",
      "Political leaders from both parties often promote business investments and will often take some credit when those ventures boom. President Joe Biden, for example, visited projects by companies such as chipmaker TSMC to highlight historic incentives the government approved for green energy and high-tech firms.",
      "Monday's event recalled pageantry familiar from Trump's first term in office, which was punctuated by high-profile announcements of investments. Many of those planned projects had been in the works already or were hazy in their chances of becoming reality.",
      "Those included Taiwanese semiconductor giant Foxconn's plans to build up a technology park in Wisconsin, which Trump had boasted would become the \"eighth wonder of the world\". Instead of creating more than 13,000 jobs and spending more than $10bn, the company created less than 1,000 jobs and spent around $1bn, according to CNBC.",
      "Trump had also said he would save a failed car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, with an electric vehicle start-up backed by Foxconn and had celebrated promises to create a million jobs over five years made by Alibaba's Jack Ma.",
      "The car company - Lordstown Motors - filed for bankruptcy and reorganized to become Nu Ride Inc earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, Alibaba has said it \"supported\" 403,000 US jobs in 2022, five years after Mr Ma made his promise.",
      "Mr Son's relationship with Trump also dates back to his first election.",
      "Shortly after Trump took the White House, the two men appeared together to discuss $50bn Mr Son planned to invest in the US, as his firm was evolving into a kind of technology venture-capital firm.",
      "Its current holdings include US telecom firm T-Mobile and UK microchip designer Arm."

      "But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.",
      "When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost \u00a331.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of \u00a332.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased.",
      "Turkey and Brussels sprouts cheaper",
      "The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.",
      "The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.",
      "Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.",
      "\"Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,\" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957.",
      "However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts.",
      "\"It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down.\"",
      "Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year.",
      "Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.",

      "But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if \"when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo\".",
      "This is because carrots are often chosen as \"loss leaders\" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items.",
      "Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.",
      "\"Every year they do the same thing,\" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price \"potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts\".",
      "Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says.",
      "While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices \"don't show the true cost to the farmer\" and can generate a lot of food waste.",

      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",

      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",

      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:08:26 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",

      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",

      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",

      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",

      "\"She had to use a lot of descriptions. She had to use a lot more words than she's used to when she's teaching people to dance.\"",
      "Some routines were easier than others, he added, with the paso doble proving particularly challenging.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.",
      "\"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says.",
      "He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.",
      "\"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\"",
      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",
      "\"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.",
      "\"Best musical monkey!\" he beams.",
      "Gracey laughs. \"If that was a category, we would definitely win.\"",

      "This year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.",
      "Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmas topped the yuletide singles chart, remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot.",
      "As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas.",
      "At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list.",
      "Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.",
      "Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.",
      "Also in this year's mix are Brenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation of Band Aid.",
      "They're joined by a new festive tune by Tom Grennan, while songs by Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson have established themselves as returning Christmas classics.",
      "Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young.",
      "There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.",
      "And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.",
      "\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says.",
      "\"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.",
      "\"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\"",
      "Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.",
      "\"The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,\" Talbot notes.",
      "That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "\"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.",
      "\"Streaming doesn't really work.\" Instead, he says: \"It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.\"",

      "Mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020, returning to the summit in 2022.",
      "Yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every December, the unofficial queen of Christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by US authorities) has never been at the top of the UK chart in Christmas week itself.",

      "\"I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff.\" Aww.",
      "Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists.",

      "This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.",

      "Chart expert James Masterson says the Christmas number one race began as an invention of British bookmakers in 1984.",
      "While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been \"ruined\" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby.",
      "\"It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,\" he says of the LadBaby era.",
      "\"Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.\"",
      "Last Christmas \"won by default\", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing \"the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order\".",
      "'Disaster for the concept'",
      "Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.",
      "Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.",
      "But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to \"achieve enough momentum\" to \"get lucky\".",

      "\"No-one knew about it,\" he says.",
      "Fans can breathe a sigh of relief, though.",
      "Khan didn't quit for long. And now he's back and is promoting Laapataa Ladies - or Lost Ladies - a film he's produced. It is India's official pick for the Oscars in the best international feature film category.",

      "Known for tackling social issues, Aamir's films are widely acclaimed as well as breaking box office records.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.",
      "Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.",
      "Khan said he's \"not quite sure how seriously\" to take awards. \"Cinema is so subjective,\" he says.",
      "But he admits a win would mean a lot to India.",
      "\"I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,\" he says.",

      "Khan describes the plot as \"a bit Shakespearean\", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.",
      "But, he adds, it's saying \"a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do\".",
      "It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.",
      "\"Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,\" he says.",
      "\"Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it.\"",

      "The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.",
      "\"I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,\" he says.",

      "\"We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,\" he says.",

      "But victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something Khan attributes to the competition.",
      "\"India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,\" he says.",
      "\"But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.\"",
      "As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is \"possible\".",
      "But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.",
      "\"I've never really looked at an international audience,\" he says. \"We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.",
      "\"That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now.\"",
      "'I don't work after 6 o'clock'",

      "\"And I thought he was right. So since then, that's what I've been trying to do - living a balanced life where I'm working really hard, in fact I'm doing much more work that I ever did, but I don't work after 6 o'clock any more.\"",
      "Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.",
      "\"I think that's something that's really helped me. That's really helped me understand myself better.",

    "story": [
      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",
      "He worked with banjo maestro B\u00e9la Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",

      "There have been claims that the scope of the role is not clear, that patients are not always aware of the status of PAs, and that their differentiation with doctors is becoming blurred.",
      "An independent review of the role, announced by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, will report in the spring.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:11:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Why hair twiddling, pen tapping or thigh jiggling can cause rage and distress for some people.",
    "story": [
      "\"If I see someone tapping their fingers on a desk, my immediate thought is to chop their fingers off with a knife,\" an anonymous patient confides to a researcher.",
      "Another shares: \"When I see someone making really small repetitive movements, such as my husband bending his toes, I feel physically ill. I hold it back but I want to vomit.\"",
      "Sound familiar? If so, perhaps you too have a condition called misokinesia - a diagnosable hatred of fidgeting.",
      "Scientists are striving to understand more about the phenomenon that has no known cause, as yet.",
      "For the latest research, featured in the journal PLoS One, experts carried out indepth interviews with 21 people belonging to a misokinesia support group.",
      "Common triggers were leg, hand or foot movements - jiggling thighs, twitchy fingers and shuffling shoes.",
      "Pen clicking and hair twiddling were also triggers, though not quite as frequently.",
      "Often people reported some overlap with another more recognised condition called misophonia - an intense dislike of other people's noises, such as heavy breathing or loud eating.",
      "It's impossible to know exactly how many people might be experiencing misokinesia. One recent Canadian study suggested perhaps one in three of us might be adversely affected by other people fidgeting, experiencing intense feelings of rage, torture and disgust.",
      "I spoke with Dr Jane Gregory, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University in the UK, who has been studying and treating both misokinesia and misophonia.",
      "She told BBC News: \"The two go alongside each other very frequently. Often people have both at the same time.\"",
      "Although there is no good data, Dr Gregory says the conditions are probably suprisingly common.",
      "\"Obviously, people have been experiencing it for a long time but just didn't have a name for it.\"",
      "The severity of people's aversion to fidgeting varies, she tells me.",
      "\"Some people might get really annoyed by fidgeting or repetitive movements but it doesn't impact massively on day-to-day life,\" she says.",
      "Others, however, may \"get a really strong emotional reaction - anger, panic or distress - and just can't filter them out\".",
      "Through Dr Gregory's work, she tends to meet people with more extreme symptoms. Many are adults who have endured misokinesia for years, but some are in their early teens and experiencing it for the first time.",
      "'It just explodes inside you'",
      "Andrea, 62 and from the UK, says she developed misophonia and misokinesia at 13 but that it wasn't recognised at the time.",
      "One of her earliest memories of the condition is being distressed by a girl at school who was picking her nails.",
      "\"Most of misokinesia tends to focus around people's hands - what they are doing with their hands and what they are touching,\" she says.",
      "Another trigger for her is when people partially cover their mouth with their hand while speaking - she struggles to watch and feels like her own mouth is becoming sore when she does.",
      "Andrea says the anger she experiences is explosive and instantaneous.",
      "\"There's no thought process in it. There's no rationale. It just explodes inside you, which is why it is so distressing.\"",
      "She tells me she has tried different strategies to manage her condition, but can't block it out.",
      "Now she shields herself from society, living alone and working from home, and says her whole life is designed around avoiding the things that could distress her.",
      "Andrea says she has lots of supportive friends who understand that she sometimes needs to modify how she interacts with them.",
      "\"It's easier to just withdraw. To try and survive it. You can't keep asking other people not to do things.\"",
      "She explains that she doesn't blame people for their fidgeting and understands that most people's actions are unintentional and done out of habit.",
      "Andrea says sharing her experiences with a Facebook support group has been a real help.",
      "'I get so much anger'",
      "Jill, who is 53 and from Kent, is another member of that group.",
      "She says her misokinesia makes her heart race.",
      "\"Anything can trigger me, from leg bouncing to how someone looks and holds their fork.",
      "\"I get anger, so much anger.",
      "\"My heart starts beating too fast. It's like a fight for flight.\"",
      "Ball of anxiety",
      "Julie, who is 54 and from Hull, says the main feeling she experiences with her misokinesia is angst.",
      "\"The other day, I was on the bus and there was a lady walking by and both her arms were swinging. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I was getting really anxious with it, not angry.",
      "\"It's silly things like someone is making me a cup of tea and they get the teabag and bounce it up and down, up and down, up and down. Why?",
      "\"Or if someone is sat there wobbling their leg. I can't take my eyes off it. Or if I do look away, I have to look back to see if they are still doing it.\"",
      "She tells the BBC the unpleasant feeling afterwards can eat away at her for hours.",
      "\"I'm not an angry person. It just makes me feel like there is a ball in my stomach that wants to explode. It's not anger, it's feeling really anxious inside.\"",
      "Julie says she is not afraid to ask people to stop doing something that she is finding distressing, but tends to walk away instead.",
      "Her misokinesia makes her unhappy, she tells me.",
      "\"It makes me internalise it. I don't like myself for feeling like this.\"",
      "Hypervigilant inner meerkat",
      "Dr Gregory says the condition can be extremely debilitating and prevent people from focusing and doing normal things.",
      "\"Part of their brain is constantly thinking about this movement,\" she explains.",
      "\"Violent images might pop into their head. They want to grab the person and force them to stop... even though they are not angry in their normal lives.\"",
      "In terms of why some people are triggered, Dr Gregory says it might be a heightened basic survival instinct - like a meerkat on the lookout for danger.",
      "She likens the feeling to seeing \"someone scurrying in the distance\" or \"tuning into footsteps behind you\".",
      "\"For some people, you don't tune it out again. Your brain is continually monitoring.\"",
      "In noisy, hectic modern life, it's not very useful, she says.",
      "And if you keep getting triggered, the frustration and anger can build.",
      "For some people, it's strangers' habits that are most irksome, while for others, it's loved ones.",
      "One common way people try to manage the condition is by avoiding looking at fidgeting or by distracting themselves, Dr Gregory says.",
      "Others may try to avoid people entirely, as much as they can.",
      "If there is only one isolated visual trigger - such as hair twirling - the expert says it is sometimes possible to use reframing therapy to help the person view the situation in a more positive way.",
      "\"You might look at it deliberately and create a new backstory for why someone is doing that movement.\"",
      "That can help reduce the anger and anxiety, she says.",
      "\"A lot of people feel really embarrased or ashamed that they get such strong reactions,\" Dr Gregory adds.",
      "\"That, itself, can be a problem because suppressing your emotions can intensify them and make them worse.\""

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:27:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The psychological condition stops players from releasing a dart.",
    "story": [
      "Former professional darts champion Kevin Painter has thrown arrows almost every day for 40 years.",
      "Throughout his career he thrived under pressure, playing in the most prestigious competitions and taking home more than \u00a3900,000 in prize money.",
      "But earlier this year, he went to throw a dart and it physically would not leave his hand.",
      "\"You're in shock, I stood there for ages. I just couldn't get my arm up to let go of the dart,\" he said.",
      "Kevin was suffering from dartitis, a mental condition where the brain stops a player from being able to release a dart.",
      "Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge.",
      "\"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University.",
      "From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis.",
      "\"I used to combat it with extra practice. It was heard of back in the day, but not many people spoke about it,\" she said.",
      "Dartitis can affect all players, professional or amateur.",
      "Jack Langston, a darts referee and online content creator, was 12 when he first experienced the condition.",
      "\"There was a little pause just before I threw the dart,\" he said.",
      "It was barely noticeable at first but eventually it became so bad he would take 60 seconds to throw three darts.",
      "By the age of 13, he was forced to quit and at the time, considered his darts career to be over.",
      "\"You're turning up and getting beat by people you know you should be beating,\" he said.",
      "\"It's so demoralising. It's a real mental struggle.\"",
      "Every case is different, and there is no one single cause, but lots of players report it comes from a fear of missing.",
      "\"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said.",
      "\"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\"",
      "Dr Duffy says that - perhaps due to its name - players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions.",
      "\"It's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way,\" she says. \"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder.\"",
      "She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",
      "During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are then \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said.",
      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.",
      "The therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said.",
      "Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions.",
      "\"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\"",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",
      "But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments.",
      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "In another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

      "The blunt truth is it has long been highly unlikely that this government or its Conservative predecessor would pay compensation to women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
      "The institutional failure was less egregious than the Post Office or infected blood scandals, but the potential bill for the government was colossal.",
      "And ministers are not exactly awash with money.",
      "The problem for Sir Keir Starmer is there was a spectacular failure of expectation management.",
      "He can point to it not being a promise in his general election manifesto, just as it wasn't a promise in the Conservative manifesto either.",
      "But Sir Keir's words and actions, and those of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves among others, including photos of them with the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaigners, left those campaigners with the impression that Labour was on their side.",
      "But when it came to brass tacks, to financial compensation, they were not.",
      "Labour in opposition could not resist sympathising with those who felt wronged by the government.",

      "The Labour front bench looked slumped, slouched and sullen today - the realities of government still proving heavy after less than six months in office.",
      "The cancellation of the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners, announced in July, is still making headlines.",
      "The government has a guiding mission of delivering economic growth, but the economy is shrinking.",

      "Perhaps little wonder Nigel Farage and Reform UK feel this is an opportune moment for them to seize, if they can convince voters that neither the Conservatives nor Labour can make a decent fist of making life better.",
      "I was struck at the tone Farage struck in his description of his trip to Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's Florida retreat.",
      "He told me how positive, optimistic and upbeat the whole affair was. The contrast he sought to draw with a gloomy Blighty was not subtle.",
      "And make no mistake, Reform might only have five MPs, but senior folk at the top of both the Labour and Conservative parties look across at them with genuine fear.",
      "Their only solution, in the end, is being able to prove they can deliver.",
      "And yet both here and in other comparable Western democracies, governing in the 2020s looks grindingly difficult.",
      "Any brief notions that Labour's landslide general election victory would herald a certain serenity at Westminster have long since blown away.",
      "There is every likelihood 2025 will be fractious and angry, with an impatient electorate looking on."

      "In the first Prime Minister's Questions since the government announced they would not be providing compensation, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said the Waspi women had \"fought one of the most sustained and passionate campaigns for justice that I can remember, year in, year out\".",

      "Ministers argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally, but it has prompted a backlash from the County Councils Network, which represents large county authorities.",
      "The CCN said rural areas were set to lose out, and argued that deprivation is not a \"key indicator of which councils are under the most financial distress\".",
      "This argument is set to grow louder next year, when the government consults on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026 as part of a wider shake-up of council financing.",
      "Ministers say the new formula will take into account the \"impact of rurality\" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Tory councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being short-changed.",

      "Next year's settlement includes an extra \u00a3200m to help councils with responsibility for adult social care to provide subsidies for care costs, taking total funding in this area to \u00a33.7bn next year.",

      "Tax rises",
      "Charitable and private sector providers are ineligible for a funding pot reserved to compensate public sector bodies, although the prime minister's spokesman said a plan to alleviate the rise for hospices would be announced before Christmas.",
      "Although councils will share \u00a3515m to offset NI rises for their employees, the CCN argued the sum would not be enough to offset indirect costs from council services delivered by private providers.",
      "The LGA has also argued extra costs for contractors will mean some council services will become more expensive to deliver.",
      "Shadow local government minister David Simmonds said the government's funding boost was \"beautifully packaged\" but councils would find the \"box is somewhat emptier than people were expecting\" given funding pressures.",
      "He added that councils also faced uncertainty over the costs of funding local elections next year, after the government confirmed plans this week to merge councils as part of a major shake-up of the council map."

      "Savile's work as an entertainer with the BBC and his charitable efforts gave him unsupervised entry to sensitive areas like hospital wards, schools and mortuaries, where he abused vulnerable people.",
      "Since becoming an MP in July, White said she had found \"most people will not stop you going into services in your constituency,\" she added.",

      "Outside of this political parties are responsible for carrying out their own vetting to ensure they select the right candidates.",
      "White said adding DBS checks in Parliament would raise vetting standards since \"parties will not risk putting a candidate forward without\" checking their criminal history themselves.",
      "A DBS check would also allow the public to make more informed choices with their elected representatives.",

    "summary": "Tens of thousands of pensioners might not get their Winter Fuel Payments this year because of a backlog in processing claims.",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payments before the end of the year as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been grappling with a growing backlog of new claims for Pension Credit, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.",
      "There has been a surge in applications for Pension Credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that Winter Fuel Payments for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving Pension Credit.",
      "There was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims as of mid-November with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures.",
      "With a likely similar amount of new applications each week since then, there is a  risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of the year.",
      "The DWP said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "Gary Jameson in Oxford applied for Pension Credit in early September, well in advance of his 66th birthday, so he wouldn't lose out when his disability benefits stopped. But his birthday has been and gone and he has still not had a decision.",
      "\"I'm having to transfer money from my own private savings, which are not very much anyway,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "He was originally told it would take six to 10 weeks to process his claim, \"but I think with all the delays it will probably be months,\" he added.",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Pensioners encouraged to claim",
      "On 18 December, MPs are launching an inquiry into how changes to the Winter Fuel Payment are affecting pensioner poverty.",
      "Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.",
      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",
      "The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed.",
      "In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000.",
      "However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then.",
      "BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November.",
      "The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment.",
      "In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it.",
      "After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people.",
      "However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.",

    "summary": "Campaigners say they were not properly informed of a pension age rise to bring them in line with men.",
    "story": [
      "Campaigners have reacted with fury to what they call the government's \"unjustified\" rejection of compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
      "They say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but has rejected any kind of financial payouts.",
      "Nine months ago, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,950 for each of those affected.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign described the government's decision as an \"insult\".",
      "\"The government has today made an unprecedented political choice to ignore the clear recommendations of an independent watchdog,\" said Angela Madden, who chairs the campaign group.",
      "\"This is a bizarre and totally unjustified move which will leave everyone asking what the point of an ombudsman is if ministers can simply ignore their decisions.\"",
      "The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least \u00a310,000 each.",
      "But Kendall said there was evidence that there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age, and sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe \"paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to \u00a310.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the Waspi women's concerns, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\".",
      "However, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who pledged to compensate the women in the party's 2019 manifesto, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the money would not have had to be paid in a year but over \"quite a long period of time\".",
      "\"These Waspi women... are actually taxpayers also, and they're people that have made an enormous contribution to our lives and society,\" he said.",
      "How the saga unfolded",
      "The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.",
      "But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.",
      "Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.",
      "But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.",
      "The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",
      "Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",
      "What is the row over women's state pension?",
      "While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it.",
      "The work and pensions secretary said the government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age.",
      "She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said the government had \"turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own\".",
      "For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts.",
      "A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Change of tack",
      "The Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power.",
      "Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website.",
      "Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said:  \"The fact that many of the women affected will also be coping with the loss of their Winter Fuel Payment this year will intensify their sense of injustice.\"",

    "summary": "Navin Ramgoolam says the original agreement did not benefit his nation enough.",
    "story": [
      "Mauritius says it has submitted changes to a proposed deal over the future of the Chagos Islands, with the country's new PM saying the original agreement did not benefit his country enough.",
      "Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease over Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.",
      "It was finalised shortly before an election which then-Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth lost in a landslide defeat.",
      "His successor Navin Ramgoolam has since said he had reservations about the deal, which has also attracted criticism from the opposition Conservative party in the UK and officials in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Jugnauth called it a \"seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law\".",
      "The British government has said that it also \"protects the long term secure operation of [the military] base\".",
      "Soon after coming into office last month, however, Ramgoolam asked legal experts to review the terms of the deal.",
      "Speaking in the Mauritian parliament on Tuesday, Ramgoolam said that his government had submitted counter-proposals aimed at ensuring that the final agreement aligned with the nation's interests.",
      "\"During the discussions, Mauritius made clear that while it is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom, the draft agreement which was shown to us after the general elections is one which, in our view, would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement,\" Ramgoolam told MPs.",
      "He did not spell out what the counter-proposals were or the exact nature of the objections.",
      "Ramgoolam confirmed that the UK's response to these proposals was received on Monday and is currently under review.",
      "A delegation of senior officials from the UK, led by Harriet Mathews, director general for Africa, the Americas, and Overseas Territories at the Foreign Office, visited Mauritius last week.",
      "Accompanied by British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre, she met Ramgoolam on 11 December to further the negotiations.",
      "\"We remain confident the agreement is in both sides interests and will continue to work with the new Mauritius government to finalise the deal. We've always said we'll engage with the new administration in order to finalise the deal,\" Sir Keir's spokesperson said, adding that there was no timeline on the deal.",
      "The only hint at what might be the issue from the Mauritian side are comments made last month by Arvin Boolell, the minister of agro-industry and fisheries.",
      "He criticised the former prime minister for granting the UK a long lease over Diego Garcia - he said it was 200 years, though the publicised timeframe was an initial period of 99 years.",
      "\"In other words,\" Boolell remarked to a newspaper, \"the tenant has become the owner of Diego Garcia for 200 years.\"",
      "In the UK meanwhile, the opposition Conservative party said on Tuesday that the terms of the proposed deal were \"disadvantageous to the United Kingdom\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir, the shadow defence and foreign secretaries said they had \"grave concerns about your Government's plan to surrender sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory - and to pay for the privilege of doing so\".",
      "\"Our view remains that the legal justification you have used for giving away sovereignty is flawed, and it is therefore no surprise that the terms reached are so disadvantageous to the United Kingdom,\" James Cartlidge and Priti Patel said.",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\".",
      "The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base.",
      "Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.",
      "Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.",

      "Under the proposals, the government also wants to merge areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services.",
      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "In a speech announcing the plans, Rayner said devolution would be the \"default\" rather than \"at the whim of a minister in Whitehall\".",
      "She described the UK as the \"most centralised\" country in Europe and pledged to end \"micromanaging by central government\".",
      "Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans but where they are unable to agree on a way forward, ministers would get the power in law to \"knock heads together\" and create larger authorities.",

      "Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing.",

      "Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal.",

      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and amount to arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",
      "She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\".",
      "The Conservatives said Rayner's announcement was part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.",
      "However, the proposals have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\".",
      "Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".",
      "She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\".",
      "Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals: Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire.",

    "summary": "The foreign secretary's remarks come as the government announced \u00a350m of humanitarian aid for Syrians.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said the British government has had \"diplomatic contact\" with the Syrian rebel group that toppled the Assad regime.",
      "Lammy said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, but the UK \"can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact, as you would expect\".",
      "His US counterpart Antony Blinken said on Saturday that the US had made \"direct contact\" with the HTS rebels now in control of Syria.",
      "Lammy's remarks come as the government announced a \u00a350m humanitarian aid package for vulnerable Syrians, including refugees in the region.",
      "Speaking on Sunday, Lammy said: \"We want to see a representative government, an inclusive government. We want to see chemical weapons stockpiles secured, and not used, and we want to ensure that there is not continuing violence.",
      "\"For all of those reasons, using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and of course intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.\"",
      "The diplomatic contact with HTS does not mean the foreign secretary has personally been in touch with the rebel group.",
      "Whitehall sources say the contact referred to is permitted under the terms of existing terrorism legislation, under which, for example, NGOs would be able to have contact in order to provide humanitarian assistance.",
      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",
      "Both the UK and the US have a vested interest in what happens next in Syria. Blinken told reporters on Saturday that the US interaction with HTS was in particular over the fate of the missing American journalist, Austin Tice.",
      "The US State Department said Blinken and Lammy spoke on Sunday, as the secretary of state told the foreign secretary Washington will back \"an accountable and representative\" government in Syria, \"chosen by the Syrian people\".",
      "Asked whether HTS could be removed from the UK's list of proscribed terror groups, Lammy said the rebel group remains a proscribed organisation that came out of al-Qaeda.",
      "\"Al-Qaeda is responsible for a tremendous loss of life on British soil,\" Lammy said, adding: \"We will judge them [HTS] on their actions, I won't comment on future proscription but of course we recognise that this is an important moment for Syria.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said no decision had been made yet on HTS's proscription status.",
      "On the cash pledge to the Middle Eastern country, Lammy said it followed talks on Saturday in Aqaba.",
      "Hosted by Jordan, delegates from several countries agreed on the importance of a \"non-sectarian and representative government\", protecting human rights, unfettered access for humanitarian aid, the safe destruction of chemical weapons and combatting terrorism.",
      "The talks were attended by the UK, US, France, Germany, the Arab Contact Group, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the EU and UN.",
      "HTS was not present at the meeting in Jordan.",
      "However, everybody in Aqaba felt it was important to engage with HTS, and that engagement should be on the basis of humanitarian access and the principles outlined above.",
      "The UK said \u00a330m will be channelled within Syria for food, shelter and emergency healthcare, while \u00a310m will go to the World Food Programme (WFP) in Lebanon and \u00a310m to WFP and the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, in Jordan.",
      "As well as the \u00a350m in aid for Syrians in the region, the UK government said \u00a3120,000 of UK funding will be given to support the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) \"to rid Syria of chemical weapons\" and support the interim Syrian government.",
      "The UK closed its embassy in Damascus in 2013, two years after the Arab Spring protests began to be brutally suppressed there by the Assad regime.",
      "Between 2011 and 2021, more than 30,000 Syrians were granted asylum in the UK, but on Monday the Home Office said it was no longer possible to assess outstanding cases given the change in circumstances.",
      "Last week, the HTS rebel group toppled Assad's rule alongside allied rebel factions.",
      "The Home Office later paused its decisions on Syrian asylum claims to the UK as the government has not determined whether Syria, under the new rebel-led authorities, is a safe country which people could be sent to.",
      "The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years. In 2011, Bashar al-Assad crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.",
      "More reports are now emerging of the cruelty of Assad's regime and the suffering it inflicted on the lives of so many Syrians.",

      "Known only as H6 due to a court order protecting his identity, the businessman was banned last week by the UK's semi-secret national security court, which heard he had formed an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the Duke of York.",
      "A hearing over his anonymity is set to take place at the Royal Courts of Justice at 14:00 GMT.",
      "Also on Monday, Sir Iain is expected to ask Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, if she will make a statement on the \"extent of United Front Work Department operations within the UK\".",
      "The United Front Work Department is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which H6 is believed to have been associated with. The department is tasked with conducting influence operations.",
      "Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was \"concerned about the challenge that China poses\".",
      "\"In relation to any discussions with Buckingham Palace there's a long-standing convention in the United Kingdom that that's never spoken about,\" he added in response to questions on H6's close ties to Prince Andrew.",
      "Other politicians have also shown concern over the reach of the United Front Work Department.",
      "Former security minister Tom Tugendhat said it showed the \"the level of threat\" posed by China to the UK.",
      "\"They're trying to change the policies of the UK and other countries around the world,\" he said.",

      "Questions over Prince Andrew's judgement and finances raised again",
      "Talking to BBC Breakfast, Tugendhat said it was a way for the CCP to \"exert influence\" within the UK.",
      "Last week, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he had \"ceased all contact\" with the Chinese businessman, with all meetings having been \"through official channels\" and \"nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed\".",
      "H6 was invited to the prince's birthday party in 2020 and was told he could act on his behalf when dealing with potential investors in China.",
      "In a letter found on one of H6's confiscated devices, the Chinese businessman was told by one of Prince Andrew's advisors: \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\"",
      "It is not clear how H6 became close to Prince Andrew.",
      "The alleged targeting by an alleged Chinese influence operation is the latest controversy for Prince Andrew, who is no longer a working royal.",
      "It followed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances this autumn, when King Charles withdrew his financial support for Prince Andrew and the costs of running Royal Lodge in Windsor, with a security bill costing several million pounds per year.",
      "Following this latest controversy there have been reports that Prince Andrew is being encouraged to keep a low profile over the Christmas season.",
      "He would usually be part of the Royal Family's Christmas Day appearance at church in Sandringham and at another Christmas Royal gathering this week and there have been suggestions he will be advised to keep out of public sight and not attract any more attention.",
      "The concerns are that Prince Andrew would become the talking point and overshadow such events, so he might be urged to voluntarily reduce his public visibility over Christmas.",
      "Prince Andrew still attends family events and ceremonial occasions, but not always the public moments. For instance, he has attended the annual Order of the Garter ceremony, without taking part in the public procession.",

      "He then brought his case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a court set up to consider appeals against decisions to ban or remove someone from the country on national security or related grounds. In the published ruling, external, the judges upheld Braverman's decision.",
      "H6 has met with many senior figures in the UK, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and Prince Andrew, to whom he was described as a \"close confidant\".",
      "But Sir Iain, who led the Conservative party 2001-2003, said the bigger issue of H6 and Prince Andrew is how China's well-funded attempts to make contact with influential individuals has been happening in \"plain view\".",
      "\"The reality is that there are many many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that's taking place.\"",
      "H6 is not allowed to be named under an anonymity order imposed by the courts last week, which Sir Iain called ridiculous.",
      "It is believed that some MPs may use parliamentary privilege to name the Chinese businessman. Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers unrestricted free speech within the chambers, and allows them to name people without the fear of being dragged before the courts and sued for defamation.",
      "But others, including Jim McMahon, the minister of housing, communities and local government, believe the naming of H6 is a \"matter for the courts\".",

      "The number of migrants crossing the Channel in Labour's first five months in office is down on the same period in 2022, a record year for arrivals, but similar to the number who crossed in that period in 2021.",

      "Asked whether Labour would also consider processing asylum claims offshore, Cooper said the government would \"look at whatever works\" but emphasised that any such scheme would need to be \"effective\".",
      "She also blamed an increase in hotel places for asylum seekers since the election on a \"collapse in decision-making\" ahead of the vote, which she argued had left Labour with a \"soaring backlog\" of cases on entering office.",
      "Speaking on Sky News, Home Office minister Angela Eagle defended the lack of an official timetable for reducing crossings, adding that the public wanted to see \"steady progress\" rather than a \"date snatched out of the air\".",

    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",

      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",

      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 11:47:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM and his colleagues agree the illegal people smuggling trade in Britain must end - but there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
    "story": [
      "\"There isn't an easy or nice way of doing it.\"",
      "It's a blunt reality check from a former Home Office minister describing one of the government's most pressing dilemmas - how to crack down on the illegal trade of smuggling people into Britain.",
      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "Brexit",
      "The UK has joined a trade pact with several countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan and Australia.",
      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",
      "But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.",

      "As a result, councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "The government has previously described the grey belt as \"poor quality and ugly areas\" on the green belt. A disused garage in Tottenham, north London, which could not be built on because it was within the green belt, has been used as an example.",
      "There is no official data on the size of the grey belt.",
      "However, estate agent Knight Frank carried out research and identified 11,000 previously developed sites \u2013 making up less than 1% of the green belt.",

    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",

      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",

      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",

      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",
      "The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity."

      "The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January - nine days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was \"the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",
      "TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.",
      "TikTok said Wednesday it was pleased with the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 06:13:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

    "story": [
      "This is the second feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Terry Quinn was only in his teens when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In some ways he rebelled against the label and frequent tests, not wanting to feel different.",
      "His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn\u2019t really on his radar. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d lose my sight,\u201d says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire.",
      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

      "Russia had a significant military presence in Syria during Bashar al-Assad's rule - helping him stay in power after the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.",
      "Its two most significant bases are the port at Tartous, established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and then expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012, and the airbase at Hmeimim, which has been operational since 2015 and was used to launch air strikes across Syria in support of Assad.",

Its publicly available tracker showed it over Russian airspace, travelling in the direction of Syria. It then disappeared from Flightradar24 off the Syrian coast, west of Hmeimim air base, likely because its public tracker was switched off. It can next be seen heading back north six hours later.",

      "He called for all parties, inside and outside Syria, to do all they could to create stability in the country.",
      "Bashar al-Assad's regime was overthrown less than two weeks ago by a rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, a Sunni Islamist group that claims to have disavowed its jihadist extremist past since it split from al-Qaeda in 2016.",
      "HTS is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU, the UK and others.",

      "\"Member states are following very carefully what will be happening on the ground, but I do believe that if what has been said in public is actually being implemented in practice, yes, then I think we can see the delisting and the end of sanctions.\"",
      "As for Syria's neighbours, Mr Pedersen said that Israel's actions since the fall of Assad had been \"highly irresponsible\".",
      "Since the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied and later annexed the area of southern Syria known as the Golan Heights. Most other states, other than the US, consider the Golan to be occupied land.",
      "Israel's current bombing campaign against Syrian military facilities and its occupation of more Syrian land in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone and neighbouring areas were, Mr Pedersen said, \"a danger to the future of Syria, and these activities need to stop immediately\".",
      "\"There is no reason that Israel should occupy new Syrian territory. The Golan is already occupied. They don't need new land to be occupied. So what we need to see is that also Israel acts in a manner that don't destabilise this very, very fragile transitional process,\" he added.",
      "Mr Pedersen is also concerned about the complex web of power in northern Syria.",
      "Turkey has a well-established relationship with HTS. It has troops in the north-west, as well as a militia known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), made up of rebel factions that it backs.",
      "Since Assad was overthrown, the SNA has attacked the other force in Syria's north, a Kurdish-led militia alliance called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which is supported by the US.",
      "Mr Pedersen said it was Turkey's interests to follow certain key principles, along with other foreign powers.",
      "\"What is it that we all need to see in Syria now? We need to see stability. We need to see that there are not new population groups that are displaced. We need to see that people are not running away from Syria as refugees. We need to see that refugees are returning, that... internally displaced can be returning to their homes.\"",
      "After 54 years under the rule of two authoritarian Assad presidents, Syria is fragmented, with towns and villages heavily damaged by almost 14 years of war and a population traumatised by war and the deadly cruelty of the regime.",
      "Mr Pedersen said it was vital for HTS to start a process that will bring justice to all the families of more than 100,000 Syrians who disappeared after detention by the regime since 2011. Most are presumed dead.",
      "\"If this process is not moving in the right direction, there is a huge danger that this anger can erupt in a manner that is in no one's interest.\"",
      "Syrians, Mr Pedersen said, wanted to own the process of rebuilding their country. That might be difficult given the turbulence across the Middle East and propensity of Syria's neighbours and other big powers to interfere.",
      "Time is short. If HTS keeps its promises, \"within the next few weeks and months there is hope that Syria can have a bright future\", he said.",
      "He warned that if that doesn't happen, \"there is also a danger of new strife and even civil war.\"",

      "Another lawmaker, Connecticut Representative Jim Himes, said \"there is zero evidence of laws being broken\" by the drones.",

      "Himes said that \"millions\" of unregistered drones were operating across the US, in addition to 800,000 registered drones that weigh more than half a pound.",
      "In his own comments to the media, Biden said: \"We're following this closely, but so far, no sense of danger.\"",

      "Among those who have voiced their suspicions are President-elect Donald Trump, who has said the government \"knows what it happening\", but \"for some reason they don't want to comment\". However, he said he \"can't imagine it's the enemy\".",
      "The Pentagon earlier denied the suggestion of one New Jersey lawmaker that the possible drones came specifically from an Iranian \"mothership\", while an FBI official said there may have been \"a slight overreaction\" on the topic."

      "Listen to Andrew read this story",
      "Each morning, the queues began forming before dawn. Groups of women \u2013 always women \u2013 stood in the autumn chill on a pavement beside a busy ring road, outside Avignon's glass and concrete courthouse.",
      "They came, day after day. Some brought flowers. All wanted to be in place to applaud Gis\u00e8le Pelicot as she walked, purposefully, up the steps and through the glass doors. Some dared to approach her.",
      "A few shouted: \"We're with you, Gis\u00e8le,\" and \"Be brave.\"",
      "Most then stayed on, hoping to secure seats in the courthouse's public overflow room from where they could watch proceedings on a television screen. They were there to bear witness to the courage of a grandmother, as she sat quietly in court, surrounded by dozens of her rapists.",
      "\"I see myself in her,\" said Isabelle Munier, 54. \"One of the men on trial was once a friend of mine. It's disgusting.\"",
      "\"She's become a figurehead for feminism,\" said Sadjia Djimli, 20.",
      "But they came for other reasons too.",
      "Above all, it seemed, they were looking for answers. As France digests the implications of its largest rape trial, which is due to end this week, it's clear that many French women \u2013 and not just those at the courthouse in Avignon \u2013 are pondering two fundamental questions.",
      "The first question is visceral. What might it say about French men \u2013 some would say all men \u2013 that 50 of them, in one small, rural neighbourhood, were apparently willing to accept a casual invitation to have sex with an unknown woman as she lay, unconscious, in a stranger's bedroom?",
      "The second question emerges from the first: how far will this trial go in helping to tackle an epidemic of sexual violence and of drug-facilitated rape, and in challenging deeply held prejudices and ignorance about shame and consent?",
      "Put simply, will Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's courageous stand and her determination \u2013 as she has put it, to make \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist \u2013 change anything?",
      "Behind the masks of the accused",
      "A long trial creates its own microclimate and, over the past weeks, a strange sort of normality developed inside Avignon's Palais de Justice. Amid the TV cameras and the huddles of lawyers, the sight of dozens of alleged rapists \u2013 faces not always hidden behind masks \u2013 no longer provoked the shock it had at the start.",
      "The accused strolled around, chatting, joking, grabbing coffee from the machine or returning from a caf\u00e9 across the road, and, in the process, somehow emphasised the core argument of their various defence strategies: that these were just regular guys, a cross-section of French society, who were looking for a \"swinging\" adventure online and got caught up in something unexpected.",
      "\"[That argument is] the most shocking thing about this case. It's harrowing to think about it,\" says Elsa Labouret, who works for a French activist group, Dare to be Feminist.",
      "\"I think most people in long-term relationships with men think of their partner as someone trustworthy. But now there's this sense of identification [with Gis\u00e8le Pelicot] for a lot of women. Like, 'okay, so that can happen to me'.",
      "\"These are not criminal masterminds,\" she continues. \"They just went on the internet... So, it is possible similar things are happening everywhere.\" It's a view widely held, but also widely contested in France.",
      "France's Institute of Public Policies released figures in 2024 showing that on average, 86% of complaints of sexual abuse and 94% of rapes were either not prosecuted or never came to a trial, in the period between 2012 and 2021.",
      "Ms Labouret argues that sexual violence happens when certain men know that they \"can get away with it. And I think that's a big reason why it's so rampant in France.\"",
      "'Neither monsters nor ordinary men'",
      "Throughout the four-month trial, at the end of each courtroom break, the accused would gather by the metal detector before muscling past the mostly female press corps, also waiting to enter the chamber. Inside, one by one, the men took their turn to share their accounts.",
      "A court-appointed psychiatrist Laurent Layet testified that the accused were neither \"monsters\" nor \"ordinary men\". Some wept. A few confessed. But most offered an array of excuses, with many saying they were simply \"libertines\" \u2013 as the French put it \u2013 indulging a couple's fantasies, and that they had no way of knowing Ms Pelicot had not consented. Others claimed Dominique Pelicot had intimidated them.",
      "There are very few clear patterns or shared characteristics among the 51 men on trial. They represent a wide spectrum in society: three-quarters have children. Half are married or in a relationship. Just over a quarter of them said they had been abused or raped as children.",
      "There is no discernible grouping by age or job or social class. The two traits they all share are that they're male, and that they made contact on an illicit online chat forum called Coco, known for catering to swingers, as well as attracting paedophiles and drug dealers. According to French prosecutors, the site, which was shut down earlier this year, has been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity.",
      "Listen to Andrew talk about how Gis\u00e8le Pelicot refused to carry the shame of the 51 men she faced in court",
      "Listen to Andrew talk about how Gis\u00e8le Pelicot refused to carry the shame of the 51 men she faced in court",
      "The BBC has found that 23 of those on trial \u2013 or 45% \u2013 had previous criminal convictions. Although the authorities do not collect precise data, according to some estimates that is approximately four times the national average in France.",
      "\"There's no typical profile of men who commit sexual violence,\" concluded Labouret.",
      "One person who has followed the case more closely than most is Juliette Campion, a French journalist who has been in court throughout the trial to report for the public broadcaster France Info. \"I think this case could have happened in other countries, of course. But I think it says a lot about how men see women in France\u2026 About the notion of consent,\" she says.",
      "\"A lot of men don't know what consent actually is, so [the case] says a lot about our country, sadly.\"",
      "'A matter of Mr Everyman'",
      "The Pelicot case is certainly helping to shape the contours of attitudes to rape across France.",
      "On 21 September, a group of prominent French men, including actors, singers, musicians and journalists, wrote a public letter that was published in Liberation newspaper, arguing that the Pelicot case proved that male violence \"is not a matter of monsters\".",
      "\"It is a matter of men, of Mr Everyman,\" the letter said. \"All men, without exception, benefit from a system that dominates women.\"",
      "It also sketched out a \"road map\" for men seeking to challenge the patriarchy, with advice such as \"let's stop thinking there is a masculine nature that justifies our behaviour\".",
      "Some experts believe the huge public interest in the Pelicot case could already be producing benefits.",
      "\"This whole case is so useful for everyone, for all generations, for young boys, for young girls, for adults,\" says Karen Noblinski, a Paris-based lawyer specialising in sexual assault cases.",
      "\"It has raised awareness in young people. Rape doesn't always happen in a bar, in a club. It can happen in our home.\"",
      "The NotAllMen hashtag",
      "But there is clearly much more work to be done. I went to meet Louis Bonnet, who is the mayor of the Pelicots' home village, Mazan, early on in the trial. Although he was unequivocal in condemning the alleged rapes, he stated clearly and twice that he felt Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's experience had been overblown, and argued that as she'd been unconscious, she had suffered less than other rape victims.",
      "\"Yes, I am minimising it, because I think it could have been much worse,\" he said at the time.",
      "\"When there are kids involved, or women killed, then that is very serious because you can't go back. In this case, the family will have to rebuild itself. It will be hard, but no one died. So, they can still do it.\"",
      "Bonnet's comments provoked outrage across France. The Mayor later issued a statement, expressing his \"sincere apologies\".",
      "Online, many of the debates around the case have focused on the controversial suggestion that \"all men\" are capable of rape. There's no evidence to support such a claim. Some men have pushed back against the argument, using the hashtag #NotAllMen.",
      "\"We do not ask other women to bear the 'shame' of women who behave badly, why should the mere fact of being a man qualify us to bear the shame?\" asked one man on social media.",
      "But the pushback was swift. Women reacted to the #NotAllMen hashtag with anger and, sometimes, with details of their own abuse.",
      "\"The hashtag has been created by men and used by men. It's a way to silence the suffering of women,\" wrote journalist Manon Mariani. Later, a male musician and influencer, Waxx, added his own criticism, telling the hashtag users to \"shut up once and for all. It's not about you, it's about us. Men kill. Men attack. Period.\"",
      "Elsa Labouret believes French attitudes still need challenging. \"I think a lot of people still think that sexual violence is sexy or romantic or something that is part of the way that we do things here [in France],\" she argues.",
      "\"And it's so important that we question that and that we don't accept this kind of argument at all.\"",
      "Chemical submission and proof",
      "In her small office just behind the French parliament building on the River Seine, Sandrine Josso, an MP, has a four-letter swearword on a poster beside her desk. It captures the spirit of defiance and determination that is driving her campaign against what's known in France as \"chemical submission\", or drugging in order to rape.",
      "A year ago, in November 2023, she was at a party in the Paris apartment of a senator named Joel Guerriau. She claims that he put a drug in her champagne with the intention of raping her. Guerriau has denied attempting to drug her, blaming a \"handling error\" and telling investigators that the glass had been contaminated a day earlier.",
      "In a statement, his lawyer has said: \"We are miles away from the obscene interpretation that one might infer from reading initial reports in the press.\" A trial is anticipated next year.",
      "Josso is now campaigning, as she puts it, to \"make victims' journeys easier\" when it comes to the French legal system.",
      "\"Today, it's a disaster. Because very few victims who file complaints are able to have a trial, because of the lack of evidence. [There's not] enough medical, psychological or legal support. We find shortcomings everywhere when it concerns sexual violence.\"",
      "Josso has now joined forces with Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's daughter, Caroline, to put together a drug-testing kit that could be made available in pharmacies throughout France. It now has government backing for a trial rollout, helped by the publicity generated by the Pelicot case.",
      "\"I'm optimistic. The medical world and the French people want shame to change sides [from the victim to the accused],\" says Josso, quoting the phrase made famous by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
      "But Dr Leila Chaouachi, a chemist and expert at the Paris Addiction Monitoring Centre, says that the trial in Avignon is just one step in a long struggle to make people more aware of drugs and rape.",
      "\"It needs to become a real major public health issue that everyone takes seriously, and which forces the authorities to urgently address these issues to improve care for victims.",
      "\"It's important for all of us to think about the issue, to consider it a health issue, not just a justice issue. It concerns all of us.\"",
      "At present the word \"consent\" is not included in the definition of rape in French laws, so some have argued that it should be changed to make it more explicit. But Ms Noblinski believes the focus should be elsewhere.",
      "\"[It] should be on the police, on the investigations, on funding them properly, not on tinkering with the law,\" she says. \"They don't have sufficient resources. They have too many cases, and that's the real issue. When you have too many things to handle, it's very hard to find evidence.\"",
      "On her daily commute to the courthouse, during the first weeks of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot walked with her shoulders hunched and her posture defensive. She seemed flustered by the sheer level of interest the case generated. By the closing arguments, however, her demeanour was entirely different and she sat perfectly poised.",
      "That has coincided with a greater change: as the trial progressed, the prosecution, those watching \u2013 and Mrs Pelicot herself \u2013 came to understand the extraordinary impact of her decision to opt not just for an open trial, but for every detail to be shown in court.",
      "\"She's showing us that\u2026 if you're a victim\u2026 do your best not to carry shame. Keep your head high,\" says Elsa Labouret.",
      "\"As a woman, you start by being doubted. You start off as a liar and you have to prove that it's true. I don't doubt that every woman has been through something. Something, you know. In that way she represents all the women in the world.",
      "\"[Gis\u00e8le Pelicot] decided to make this bigger than herself. To make this about the way that we, as a society, treat sexual violence.\"",
      "Emerging from yet another day in the courtroom, the French journalist Juliette Campion stopped to reflect on what impact the case might have. \"It was difficult to see all those videos... As a woman, it's complicated, and I feel tired,\" she says.",
      "\"But at least we did our job, and we talked about it. It's a very small step. It won't be a big thing. The only thing I can hope for now is that it will be a game changer for some men. And some women too, maybe.\"",

      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "It's no match for Mars (where temperatures can go below -153C) or Moon (where -250C is the norm in some deep craters), but still, it's a test of human endurance.

But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",

      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",

      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents.

      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",

    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",
      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",

      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",

      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",

      "\"While the Fed opted to round out the year with a third consecutive cut, its New Year's resolution appears to be for a more gradual pace of easing,\" Watson said.",
      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "The Fed's battle against inflation",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Consumer prices in November rose 2.7% on a yearly basis, fueled by elevated housing and food costs. Given that stubborn inflation, many analysts think the Fed is likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:32:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve announced a third rate cut today, but also cautioned it expects fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve today made its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve made its third consecutive cut of 2024, reducing the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points. Yet the Fed also projected a slower pace of cuts in 2025, a move that had been expected by economists given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"Higher for longer is the mantra headed into 2025,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email. \"The Fed's quarterly projections indicate a common expectation of just two interest rate cuts for next year, a change of thinking from September when the median expectation was four rate cuts.\"",
      "What was the Fed rate decision today?",
      "The Fed cut its federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by 0.25 percentage points, lowered the rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its previous target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That marks the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting. With today's cut, the Fed has lowered rates by a full percentage point since September.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "The Fed expects to continue cutting rates next year, although it is now penciling in two rate cuts, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" \u00a0EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "When is the first FOMC meeting of 2025?",
      "The first FOMC meeting next year is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, with the rate decision set for Jan. 29.",
      "That means the first rate decision of 2025 will occur after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, which means the Fed at that point might have more information about the next president's plans to enact tariffs or make other economic changes, such as his pledge to usher in more tax cuts.",

      "A survey of more than 800 flight attendants conducted by UL found that 87% are concerned about lithium battery risks on airplanes, and more than a third believe airlines should do more to ensure passenger safety. While the FAA requires airlines to include general safety information in preflight announcements, those warnings often don't address the specific risk of battery fires.",
      "\"It's a balance we probably need to do a better job striking with the airlines,\" said Ben Supko, who oversees hazardous materials safety for the FAA. \"Passengers don't fully understand how serious the risk is.\"",
      "Supko said passengers need to monitor devices during a flight and immediately notifying the crew if a device becomes warm, discolors, or bulges. Passengers are also warned not to pack lithium batteries in checked luggage, as fires in the cargo hold are harder to extinguish.",
      "\"When you don't know what's going to happen, you act erratically,\" said Patel. \"It costs us nothing just to say, 'Hey, the reason why we're so serious about this is because it could be really dangerous. It could catch fire.'\"",
      "The UL survey also found that one in four passengers admits to packing lithium batteries in their checked bags. It is a dangerous practice for one reason in particular: It would be even harder to put out a fire in the plane's cargo hold.",

      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",

      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate.

    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits were cut in half, reduced from $866 a month.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",

      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",

      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",

      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",

This limited-time pricing will only be offered to those who act fast!\"",
      "Here's how the \"Go Wild!\" pass works",
      "Once you purchase the $299 deal, you can book tickets on select Frontier flights for just a penny.",
      "The airline warns that not every flight operated by Frontier is available for booking through the GoWild! pass. Additionally, pass holders must pay any taxes and fees associated with the airfare.",
      "What kind of seat do you get?",
      "GoWild! pass holders cannot reserve seats in advance, nor do their fares include carry-on or checked baggage, although these extras may be purchased separately.",
      "When can I book flights?",
      "The unlimited pass allows travelers to make reservations the day before a flight's departure for domestic travel, and ten days before an international flight's departure date.",
      "The pass is valid for travel between May 1, 2025, and April 30, 2026, Frontier said.",
      "There are certain blackout dates around holidays and other busy travel periods, during which the GoWild! Pass cannot be redeemed for a plane ticket. Additionally, pass holders cannot purchase tickets on behalf of other travelers.",
      "The $299 price tag is only available for a limited time, and the pass automatically renews for a fee of $699, according to the airline. The deal expires after 11:59 p.m. MST on Dec. 18, 2024. After that, the passes will still be available, but for $499.",
      "Frontier first offered the annual pass in 2022, which was for travel in 2023. Low-cost carriers have struggled to attract customers of late, as fliers increasingly turn to premium travel offerings, and even legacy carriers introduce new, bare-bones ticket options to compete for budget-conscious customers.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:37:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Each year, Social Security benefits are adjusted to account for inflation so beneficiaries' purchasing power doesn't erode over time. In 2025, the annual\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment\u00a0will be 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021 due to cooling inflation.",
      "For most Social Security beneficiaries, the new COLA goes into effect with their January payment.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",

The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",

The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits.

      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",

      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",

      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "The findings are based on Internal Amazon documents compiled by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "\"The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon's warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Amazon's executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.\"",
      "Amazon disputes the findings and accused Sanders of misrepresenting the company's safety record.",
      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",
      "Amazon disputes those findings. Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Airline travel in 2025 is set to become more dignified for passengers with disabilities under a new Department of Transportation rule.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday announced enhanced protections for people with disabilities traveling on commercial airlines. The new regulations are aimed in particular at protecting\u00a0passengers who use wheelchairs, after a series of violations of existing laws by airlines.",
      "For example, the new rule requires training for airlines workers responsible for physically assisting passengers with disabilities and handling their wheelchairs. It also outlines steps airlines must take if they damage or misplace a passenger's wheelchair \u2014 all in an effort to make the skies friendlier for the roughly 5.5 million Americans use a wheelchair.",

      "Indeed, when a passenger is unable to access or use their mobility device, they're effectively deprived of their freedom until it's returned or replaced.",
      "Concern over airlines' mishandling of records leads many passengers with disabilities to avoid air travel altogether, research has shown.",
      "\"Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly \u2014 and we've taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,\" Secretary Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. \"With the new protections we're announcing today, we're establishing a new standard for air travel \u2014 with clear and thorough guidelines for airlines to ensure that passengers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.\"",
      "Here's some of what the new rule requires.",
      "The rule requires that airlines assist individuals with disabilities without putting them at heightened risk of bodily injury. It must also assist them in a \"dignified\" manner, by respecting their independence, autonomy and privacy.\u00a0Airline personnel must be trained annually on physically assisting passengers who use wheelchairs or mobility devices. They must demonstrate their qualifications through competency assessments or by certification exam.It requires that passengers with disabilities receive prompt assistance when boarding and deplaning aircraft, including moving within the airport terminal.\u00a0Airlines must return all checked wheelchairs and other assistive devices to passengers in the same condition they were received.Improved seating accommodations at airports.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that his new administration will challenge a deal reached between the Social Security Administration and its union that would allow employees to continue teleworking into 2029.",
      "During remarks at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump blamed the Biden administration for what he said was a \"terrible\" and \"ridiculous\" agreement that would allow tens of thousands of federal workers to continue working from home several days a week.",
      "The president-elect said \"it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it.\" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.",
      "\"If people don't come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,\" said Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term Jan. 20.",
      "Work-from-home policies for the federal workforce have come under scrutiny by the leaders of Trump's newly created Department of Government Efficiency, billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have said they are looking to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget.",
      "\"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don't want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn't pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month.",
      "Musk then claimed on social media earlier this month that \"almost no one\" who is employed by the government works in-person, leading to \"thousands of empty buildings not just in America, but around the world, paid for with your tax dollars!\"",
      "In his remarks from Mar-a-Lago, Trump appeared to be referencing an agreement reached by the Social Security Administration and the American Federation of Government Employees earlier this month. The deal keeps in place the agency's current telework policy until October 2029.",

      "\"In the first term, everyone was fighting me,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"This time, everyone wants to be my friend.\"",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump recently, Trump said.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",

    "story": [
      "Shoppers laden with bags from Fendi, Loewe, Prada and other designer labels clog the narrow sidewalks of Milan's swankiest shopping street, bringing joy to the purveyors of high-end luxury goods this, and every, holiday season.",
      "There's even more to celebrate this year: A commercial real estate company has crowned Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",
      "A few store windows down, Franca Da Rold, who was visiting Milan from Belluno, an Italian city in the Dolomites mountain range, marveled at a chunky, meters-long knit scarf priced at 980 euros ($1,028).",
      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the accounting and advisory firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

      "This year's crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year's entrance of into the public domain of Mickey Mouse. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\"It's a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons - he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\" said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke's Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \"There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\"",
      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

    "story": [
      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",

      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a conservative revolt over a last-minute measure to keep the government funded into the spring and avoid a shutdown, with some Republicans strongly objecting to billions of dollars in spending that has been added to the bill.",
      "Congressional leaders unveiled the\u00a0stopgap funding measure late Tuesday after days of negotiations, facing a Friday deadline to approve new spending. The bill would extend government funding through March 14, but it also includes disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions. The disaster relief portion of the bill alone carries a price tag of $110 billion.",
      "The legislation immediately sparked anger from multiple members of the House Republican conference, mostly targeted at Johnson. While the speaker had pledged to avoid the kind of massive, end-of-year spending bills that conservatives loathe, the final product resembled a scaled-down version of what the party's right flank has railed against for years now.",
      "But the Republicans' slim majority in the House means Johnson will need Democratic votes to pass the bill, a dynamic that gave the minority more leverage to extract concessions during negotiations.",
      "Johnson acknowledged that the bill was intended to be \"very skinny\" before a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation left by hurricanes earlier this year.",
      "Before the text of the bill was released, Johnson dismissed Republican concerns that the continuing resolution was equivalent to an \"omnibus\" bill, a term used when Congress packages the annual appropriations bills that fund many federal government agencies into one large piece of legislation.",
      "\"This is not an omnibus, OK?\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"This is a small [continuing resolution] that we had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not man-made disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\"",
      "Further angering conservatives was Johnson's vow to give members 72 hours to read the bill before a vote. But a vote could come as soon as Wednesday, giving lawmakers less than 24 hours to get through the nearly 1,550-page text.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, on Tuesday called the process \"a total dumpster fire.\" He said he was \"disappointed\" in Johnson and called on him to \"communicate better.\" Other members, like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, have dubbed the bill the \"Cramnibus.\"",
      "The fight could prompt a challenge to Johnson's speakership when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he won't support Johnson in the speaker's election.",
      "\"I'm not voting for him,\" Massie said. \"This solidifies it.\"",
      "Massie said he's spoken with other members who have a similar stance.",
      "Johnson has run into a buzzsaw of opposition outside the House as well. Elon Musk, the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump's advisory Department of Government Efficiency, said in a post on X that any lawmaker \"who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years.\" Musk posted dozens of times throughout the day calling for lawmakers to oppose the bill, which he called \"criminal.\"",
      "The speaker told Fox News earlier in the day that he had discussed the situation with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the other DOGE co-head, on Tuesday evening. Johnson said he emphasized to them that passing a continuing resolution now would be \"clearing the decks\" and allow the incoming GOP majorities to \"put our fingerprints on the spending\" in March. Both Musk and Ramaswamy came out strongly against the bill anyway.",
      "Trump himself has not indicated publicly how he thinks lawmakers should vote, leaving Republicans in Congress to fight amongst themselves.",
      "While Johnson said he and GOP leaders had hoped to move forward with the legislation under the regular process, including bringing the bill through the House Rules Committee, pushback from committee members on the party's right flank threatened to prolong the path to passage. The legislation is expected to instead be brought up under suspension of the rules, meaning a two-thirds majority will be required for passage.",
      "The stopgap measure will lapse about two months into Trump's second term, setting up another budget fight as Republicans try to pass Trump's top priorities during his first 100 days. Though they'll have control of both chambers of Congress, House Republicans will be operating with a thinner majority until vacant seats held by members joining the Trump administration are filled.",

      "\"President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement, when asked what Trump plans to do with TPS holders and whether these immigrants would be part of his overall deportation plans.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver.\" Leavitt said. But she did not address what the Trump administration plans to do with migrants who have temporary legal U.S. status.",
      "According to the latest data, there are over 850,000 TPS holders, as of March 2024. Around 350,000 Venezuelans, 200,000 Haitians and 180,000 Salvadorans make up the largest group of beneficiaries.",
      "Approximately 300,000 TPS holders reside in Florida, while Texas has nearly 95,000, and New York and California each have around 68,000.",
      "TPS holders are provided renewable relief for up to six, 12 or 18 months, but without an extension, many will begin losing their legal status in 2025. Protections for Salvadorans are set to expire first in March, with Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan in April, and Nicraragua in July.",
      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",
      "Since Trump won the election, Vasquez says he has been taking questions at the Salvadoran consulate in Dallas from TPS holders who will be among the first to see their status expire in March.",
      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",
      "With critical deadlines looming, on Dec. 9, a group of senators sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to protect long-settled immigrants before Trump's inauguration with key action steps.",
      "Sens. Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tammy Duckworth, Mazie Hirono, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Alex Padilla asked the president to redesignate and extend TPS for all eligible countries. The senators stressed that \"worsening crises across the world,\" including in Ukraine and Nicaragua, underscore the need for continuing the protected status.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has conferred the status on nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Nepa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ukraine.",
      "Soledad Miranda, a Salvadoran TPS holder, also joined the hunger strike in Washington, D.C., urging Mr. Biden to issue an extension before he leaves office. She fears deportation and being separated from her U.S.-born daughter.",
      "\"Biden is leaving the White House, and we want him to do what he didn't do in four years.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will take up a challenge to a new law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S, setting up a showdown over access to a widely popular app used by tens of millions of Americans.",
      "Arguments will be heard by the high court on Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that allows for the court to consider the issue before the law takes effect on Jan. 19.",
      "The Supreme Court said in a brief order that the Justice Department and lawyers for TikTok, as well as a group of users who separately challenged the law, should be prepared to argue whether the ban passed by Congress violates the First Amendment.",
      "TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance,\u00a0asked the high court earlier this week to temporarily block enforcement of the law while it appealed a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Supreme Court said in its order that consideration of that request for emergency relief is deferred pending oral argument.",
      "The TikTok ban",
      "\"Congress's unprecedented attempt to single out applicants and bar them from operating one of the most significant speech platforms in this Nation presents grave constitutional problems that this Court likely will not allow to stand,\" lawyers for TikTok wrote in their request to the Supreme Court.",
      "TikTok suffered a blow on Dec. 6 when a panel of three judges from the D.C. Circuit denied its bid to overturn the law. A week later, the appeals court denied TikTok's request to delay the law from taking effect pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The law, which Congress passed in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He told reporters during a press conference Monday that the platform played a role in helping him win the youth vote in the November election and said he would \"take a look at TikTok.\"",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump\u00a0met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew\u00a0at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "With arguments before the Supreme Court set for Jan. 10, it will be the Biden administration that will present the government's case. TikTok is represented before the high court by Noel Francisco, who served as solicitor general during Trump's first term.",
      "Still, TikTok is hoping either the Supreme Court or Trump will save it.",
      "In its Dec. 6 ruling, the appeals court determined that the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese government's collection of Americans' data and the ability for it to covertly manipulate content on the platform constitute a \"compelling national security interest.\" The court called the government's concerns \"well founded,\" pushing back on TikTok's arguments that the risks were speculative.",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized its decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote for the court. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "When it challenged the law in May, TikTok asserted that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. The petition said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",

      "The Democratic-controlled Senate pushed forward with the measure nonetheless. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that while the NDAA \"isn't perfect,\" it still \"includes some very good things that Democrats fought for\" \u2014 citing provisions aimed at standing up against the Chinese Communist Party, boosting the use of artificial intelligence for national defense and expanding domestic tech innovation.",
      "\"Congress has passed the NDAA on a bipartisan basis for over six straight decades, and this year will be no different,\" Schumer said ahead of the vote on Wednesday. \"We're passing the NDAA and that's a very good thing.\"",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, derided the gender-affirming care restriction earlier this week, calling it \"the product of a nationwide campaign against trans rights\" and arguing that the legislation's approval would mark \"the first anti-LGBTQ law passed by Congress in decades.\"",
      "Still, the outcome of the vote was all but guaranteed after the Senate advanced the measure on Monday in a 83-12 procedural vote.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, celebrated the NDAA's \"immense accomplishments,\" including a 14.5% pay raise for junior service members and investments in recruitment capabilities.

      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee quietly voted to release its\u00a0report on the investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz regarding allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, reversing course after Republicans originally blocked its release.",
      "Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. A source with direct knowledge of the process said the vote was taken on Dec. 5.",
      "The report will likely be unveiled in the coming days, after the final votes of the 118th Congress, the sources said. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to approve new government funding and avoid a shutdown before heading home for the holidays.\u00a0CNN first reported on Thursday that the committee voted behind closed doors earlier this month to release the report.",
      "Republicans in the full House recently blocked\u00a0two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the Ethics Committee to release the potentially damaging report on its investigation into Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to\u00a0nominate\u00a0Gaetz to be attorney general in November. But Gaetz soon withdrew from consideration, facing a likely contentious confirmation process. Gaetz has said he does not intend to take the oath of office for the same seat in the 119th Congress, and is launching a new show on the pro-Trump One America News Network in January.",
      "It's highly unusual, but not unprecedented, for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on a member who is no longer in office. In other investigations, the prospect of a report's release has been enough to prompt the target of the probe to resign from Congress to keep it under wraps. Senior lawmakers, including some Democrats, have expressed concerns about the precedent set by unveiling the Gaetz findings after he has already stepped down.",
      "In June, the committee\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying it was investigating allegations against Gaetz that included sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and bribery.",
      "Multiple sources at the time told CBS News that\u00a0four women\u00a0had informed the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties that included sex and drugs, and that Gaetz had also attended. The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",
      "The House Ethics Committee declined to comment. Gaetz released a lengthy statement on X in response, saying he \"probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked\" more than he should have, but did nothing illegal.",
      "\"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated \u2014 even some I never dated but who asked,\" he wrote. \"I dated several of these women for years. I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court \u2014 which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "He said the Ethics investigation relied on witnesses that the Justice Department \"deemed not-credible.\"",
      "\"I've had no chance to ever confront any accusers. I've never been charged. I've never been sued,\" he wrote. \"Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "Some of the sexual misconduct allegations under review by the committee were the subject of a previous Department of Justice probe into Gaetz. Federal investigators sought to determine if Gaetz violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws, but\u00a0no charges were filed.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider the South Carolina health department's effort to cut off funding from Planned Parenthood because it performs abortions, wading into another dispute over access to the procedure in the wake of its reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The case, known as Kerr v. Edwards, stems from the state's decision in 2018 to end Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's participation in its Medicaid program. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, directed the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services and end their Medicaid agreements.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates two facilities in the state, one in Charleston and the other in Columbia, and provides hundreds of Medicaid patients with services like physicals, cancer and other health screenings, pregnancy testing and contraception. Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "Planned Parenthood and one of its patients, Julie Edwards, sued the state, arguing that cutting off its funding violated a provision of the Medicaid Act that gives beneficiaries the right to choose their provider.",
      "A federal district court blocked South Carolina from ending Planned Parenthood's participation in its Medicaid program, and a U.S. appeals court upheld that decision, finding that Edwards could sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-provider requirement.",
      "The legal battle has already been before the Supreme Court in the past, with the high court last year ordering additional proceedings after deciding in a separate case that nursing home residents could sue their state-owned health care facility over alleged violations of civil rights.",
      "After reconsidering its earlier decision, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously in March that Edwards' lawsuit against the state could go forward and said South Carolina couldn't strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funds.",
      "\"This case is, and always has been, about whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider. Preserving access to Planned Parenthood and other providers means preserving an affordable choice and quality care for an untold number of mothers and infants in South Carolina,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.",
      "South Carolina officials asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, marking the third time the case has been before the justices. The justices agreed to take up the question of whether \"the Medicaid Act's any-qualified provider provision unambiguously confers a private right upon a Medicaid beneficiary to choose a specific provider.\"",
      "South Carolina is among the more than two dozen that have passed laws restricting access to abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision reversing Roe v. Wade. In South Carolina, abortion is outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy with some exceptions.",
      "Several states have also enacted laws blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas.",

    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",
      "That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers \"unsafe\" flights near American and allied forces in the region.",
      "The Pentagon's national defense strategy is built around the assessment that China poses the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future.",
      "Corruption within the PLA has resulted in the ouster of at least 15 high-ranking officials in a major shakeup of China's defense establishment.",
      "\"This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing's confidence,\" the report said.",
      "In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry.",
      "The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area.",
      "Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China.",
      "Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027.",
      "The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion.",
      "The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.",
      "More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but \"made uneven progress toward its 2027\" milestone for modernization.",
      "One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are \"quickly approaching U.S. standards.\"",
      "Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",

Elizabeth Warren plans to propose legislation on Wednesday aimed at making the process less costly and complicated for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who seek court-sanctioned relief from debt each year.",
      "\"People typically file for bankruptcy for one of three reasons: a job loss, a medical problem or a family breakup \u2014 and when they do, they're faced with an expensive and complicated system,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement in reintroducing the bill, known as the \"Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act.\"",
      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",
      "Bankruptcies rising",
      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate. The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the AFL-CIO, a labor union, and consumer advocacy groups Public Citizen and National Consumer Law Center.",
      "\"Big corporate debtors continue to reap the rewards of our broken bankruptcy system while everyday Rhode Islanders facing financial hardship struggle to obtain basic relief. I'm pleased to support this bill that makes the consumer bankruptcy system fairer and easier to access for those facing crushing personal debt,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.",
      "Among other things, Warren's proposal would provide two routes for individuals to file for bankruptcy:",
      "No-payment discharge. For low-income filers, this option would wipe out unsecured debt other than child support or debts incurred by fraud.Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",

      "Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",
      "The change would be a welcome one, according to advocates, who say the current bankruptcy rules can steer people in the wrong direction.",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where the filer's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in three to six months.",
      "With a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, payments can be spread out, but the overall costs for filers is significantly higher, running an average of $4,500. Only about a third of people who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged, research shows.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced he will nominate Herschel Walker, the former football star whose 2022 Senate run was plagued by controversy, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.",
      "\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Trump said on social media Tuesday night.",
      "Walker would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the role. The Senate has not confirmed a U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Cassandra Butts for the role in 2014, but the Senate never even brought her nomination up for a vote, according to The Associated Press. She died in 2016.",
      "Trump in his first term nominated Doug Manchester in 2017 for the ambassador role, but his nomination stalled for over two years. CBS News in 2019 also uncovered evidence of a possible pay-to-play scheme for the role. He eventually withdrew and Trump went on to nominate William Douglass in 2020. Douglass' nomination was withdrawn by President Biden when he took office, and Mr. Biden in turn nominated Calvin Smyre, who has not been confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Absent an official ambassador to the Bahamas, Kimberly Furnish currently serves in the role of Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires.",
      "Walker rose to national prominence as a star running back for the Georgia Bulldogs, winning the Heisman trophy in 1982. He spent his first few years of professional ball in the United States Football League before it folded, and then moved on to the NFL.",
      "Walker reentered the national spotlight when, at Trump's urging, he challenged Georgia's Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock for his seat in 2022. The race featured several controversies, including two women claiming that Walker \u2014 who was running as an anti-abortion candidate \u2014 had paid for them to get abortions.",
      "Walker denied both allegations.",
      "In one instance, Walker admitted to writing a check for a woman who said he paid for her to get an abortion in 2009, but he said he hadn't known what the money was for.",
      "Another woman claimed Walker paid her to get an abortion while the two carried out a six-year relationship while he was married to another woman and playing in the NFL. During a news conference back in 2022, she said she couldn't go through with the procedure when she went to get it herself, so Walker took her to a clinic in the Dallas area the next day and waited for her while she got the abortion.",
      "\"This was a lie a week ago and it is a lie today,\" Walker said at the time following an interview the woman gave a week after the initial news conference.",
      "Warnock would go on to win the election in a runoff after neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote on election day.",

    "summary": "Leaders in Congress unveiled a measure to keep the government funded, facing a Friday night deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Leaders in Congress on Tuesday unveiled a lengthy stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, with just days to go to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Congress has until Friday night to stave off a funding lapse, since lawmakers approved a continuing resolution in September to keep the government funded through Dec. 20. The new stopgap measure, with approval from the House, Senate and President Biden, would keep the government funded through March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "The 1,500 page stopgap measure also includes a one-year extension of the farm bill, around $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in economic assistance to farmers.",
      "The continuing resolution's release comes under the wire, with House leaders under pressure to abide by a 72-hour rule for members to review legislation before it's brought to the floor. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he believes in adhering to the rule, but with the end of week deadline fast approaching, he may be out of options.",
      "The speaker also said that House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "In a statement late Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he was \"pleased these negotiations led to a bipartisan government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, while also securing Democratic priorities like millions for child care, workforce training and job placement, assistance for the Key Bridge rebuild, additional disaster relief funding and more.\"",
      "Even before its release, lawmakers on the party's right flank had begun expressing opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Leadership could instead opt to bring the legislation to the floor under a procedure known as suspension of the rules, leaning on Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority needed for passage in order to get the legislation more swiftly to the Senate before the end-of-week deadline.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar acknowledged Tuesday morning that Republicans will need Democrats to approve government funding, saying the dynamic \"has been the case this Congress,\" and \"it will continue to be the case in the next Congress.\"",
      "\"This is a lesson for Speaker Johnson,\" Aguilar said. \"Let's find solutions, let's tune out the most extreme voices in your conference, and let's find that consensus that will be necessary to fund government.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year. And he noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline.",
      "Even with this week's tight timeline, lawmakers are expected to thwart the threat of a shutdown, with little appetite in Washington for a funding lapse.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said ahead of the legislation's release Tuesday afternoon that negotiators should have already finished their work, but were delayed by \"an eleventh-hour demand from the speaker.\"",
      "\"We are heading into the holidays and the nation really needs a bipartisan package that will prevent a needless shutdown, keep our government open, and get much needed support to areas across the country that are recovering from disaster,\" Murray said.",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",
      "\"What would have been a very skinny, very simple clean CR, these other pieces have been added to it,\" Johnson said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Connolly, 74, defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0in a 131-84 vote to become the ranking member of the powerful committee. Connolly, who came to Congress in 2009, will replace Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who will serve as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.",
      "\"I think my colleagues were measuring their votes by who's got experience, who's seasoned, who can be trusted, who's capable and who's got a record of productivity,\" Connolly told reporters after the meeting. \"And I think that prevailed.\"",
      "While Democrats will remain in the minority in the new year, Connolly's elevation to ranking member places him in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President-elect Donald Trump's second term. The committee led numerous investigations into the first Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",

      "In the settlement's aftermath, Trump said Monday at a news conference in Florida that he planned to sue the Des Moines Register over a poll and vowed to continue filing suits against news outlets whom he's long accused of bias. He followed through with that threat later Monday morning, records show, filing against the newspaper in Polk County, Iowa.",
      "Trump complained at the press conference that the pollster, J. Ann Selzer, \"said I was going to lose by three or four points,\" after previous Iowa surveys showed he'd win the state easily, \"by 20 points.\" Trump won the state by 13 points.",
      "\"In my opinion, it was fraud and it was election interference,\" he said, adding, \"we'll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.\"",
      "The lawsuit accuses Selzer and the paper of \"brazen election interference\" for publishing the poll.",

      "\"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\" Anton said.",

    "summary": "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in announcing crackdown on certain consumer fees.",
    "story": [
      "Ever booked a hotel room for $200 only to be surprised by an extra $40 \"resort fee\" at checkout? A new Federal Trade Commission rule aims to put a stop to such surprise charges by banning so-called junk fees on short-term lodging as well as on tickets to live events.",
      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",
      "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay \u2014 without worrying that they'll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven't budgeted for and can't avoid,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"The FTC's rule will put an end to junk fees around live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals, saving Americans billions of dollars and millions of hours in wasted time.\"",
      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",
      "Longstanding consumer protection laws prohibit business in other industries from deceiving consumers about fees and pricing.",
      "President Biden weighed in on the FTC's action banning hidden junk fees Tuesday, saying he's prioritized lowering costs for American families.",
      "\"We all know the experience of encountering a hidden fee at the very last stage of check out \u2014these junk fees sneak onto your bill and companies end up making you pay more because they can. Those fees add up, taking real money out of the pockets of Americans,\" he said in a statement. \"Today's announcement builds on work across my administration to ban junk fees and lower costs \u2014 saving many families hundreds of dollars each year.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction in state court remains on the books Monday, after a New York judge rejected an effort by Trump to have the case tossed based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling.",

Merchan said at the time he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",

      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "A unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The nation's highest court said in that decision that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",

      "How does the Electoral College work?",
      "The rules governing the\u00a0Electoral College are outlined\u00a0by the 12th Amendment.",
      "Presidential electors, according to the amendment, \"shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify.\"",

Between the 2020 election and the 2024 election, Texas gained two Electoral College votes, while five other states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon \u2014 gained one electoral vote each.

      "Does each elector have to vote with the state election results?",
      "Forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., are winner-take-all, so the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the state's electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors based on the winner of the popular vote within each Congressional District and then two \"at-large\" electors are determined based on winner of the statewide popular vote.",

    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June. Their trip was initially only to last about eight to 10 days, but multiple issues with the Starliner prompted a concerned NASA, out of caution, to leave them behind at the space station and return the capsule to Earth empty in September.",
      "That same month, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule with a reduced two-person crew and two empty seats launched to the space station with the intention of returning Wilmore and Williams aboard it in February 2025.",
      "However, NASA said in a news release Tuesday that Wilmore and Williams' replacements, traveling aboard the SpaceX Crew-10, would be launching to the space station \"no earlier than late March 2025,\" meaning that would be the earliest that Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth.",
      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",
      "The handover period \"allows Crew-9 to share any lessons learned with the newly arrived crew and support a better transition for ongoing science and maintenance at the complex.\"",

      "The Starliner, Boeing's answer to the Crew Dragon, has faced major headwinds since it went into development, including a series of technical issues and budget shortfalls.",
      "It finally launched, but after arriving at the space station with its crew, multiple helium leaks were discovered in the Starliner's propulsion system, along with a degraded thrust in five of its maneuvering jets.",

      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",

      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14.

      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",

      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA.

During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "summary": "Scammers are using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to prey on people. But experts say there's a simple way to protect you and your family.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 15:18:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The effects of climate change have put stress on Christmas tree production in the United States. Some farmers are turning to genetics to adapt.",
    "story": [
      "People around the world are adorning homes and businesses with festive holiday decor, which typically means an abundance of Christmas trees are on display. In the U.S., they pop up everywhere from the average living room to the Rockefeller Center plaza in Manhattan and the White House in Washington, D.C.",
      "But climate change threatens to complicate the tradition. Christmas trees, like any other crop, are affected by the general rise in temperature associated with global warming and the extreme weather events that result from it.",
      "\"The Earth's climate is changing to a warmer one. And like most of society and the environment, Christmas trees are not adapting fast enough to these changes,\" according to the National Centers for Environmental Information website.",
      "Higher temperatures have led to warmer winters and longer growing seasons, which contribute to the prevalence of pests and disease that damage the trees usually decorated for Christmas. Heavier rain and oversaturated soil also put the trees at risk of contracting a notorious type of fungus-like organism that attacks them at the root, weakening and killing them quickly.",
      "Extreme heat and prolonged drought make Christmas trees more vulnerable to those problems and a host of others, including browning needles and stunted development. Unusual heat alone can cause trees to die prematurely.",
      "In Oregon, where more than a third of country's Christmas trees are grown, researchers at Oregon State University reported that record heat in the summer of 2021 destroyed roughly 70% of the Christmas tree seedlings planted that year and dried out the needles of more mature crops. Fewer viable trees could mean higher prices for consumers, although experts have largely attributed the steadily rising cost of Christmas trees in recent decades to a supply shortage that dates back to the 2008 recession, in addition to losses from extreme weather.",
      "Extreme cold can be equally destructive for these trees, which are susceptible to frost damage, as can extreme rainfall. In North Carolina, the second-highest producer of Christmas trees in the U.S. after Oregon, farmers contended with the impacts of Hurricane Helene in September.",
      "Justin Whitehill, an assistant professor at North Carolina State University who leads the school's Christmas tree genetics program, told CBS News that Helene's landslides posed a particular threat to Christmas trees grown on the sides of mountains and completely wiped out a handful of\u00a0smaller growing operations, likely costing the industry at least tens of millions.",
      "Estimates from North Carolina State suggest upwards of 40,000 acres of land are dedicated to Christmas tree production statewide, with 5 or 6 million trees harvested annually for a collective retail value of $250 million or more. Whitehill believes the industry remains strong overall because it has been forced to evolve and adapt with climate change.",
      "\"Climate change has been happening and kind of creeping up for decades now. And so the industry has been evolving alongside of it,\" he said.",
      "The genetics program at North Carolina State is an example of that. Researchers are studying the natural defense mechanisms of Christmas trees \u2014 focusing on a popular variation called Fraser firs \u2014 in hopes of using genetics and molecular biology to help the trees acclimate to climate change and increase their chances of survival.",
      "\"With our breeding work in the genetics program, we're trying to identify trees that have a little bit more resilience to some of these changing climates,\" said Whitehill. Along with determining how genetics can potentially help Christmas trees withstand warmer temperatures, he said his team is also working on strategies to protect the trees from pests.",
      "Rising temperatures are a major concern for Christmas tree growers. Even if their crops survive pests and disease, Whitehill told CBS News that cosmetics are an issue, too.",
      "\"The big thing, I think, with climate change and Christmas trees is going to be the needle loss and needle retention,\" he said. Warmer conditions can cause Christmas trees to shed their needles too early, making them less appealing to people looking to purchase one for the holidays.",
      "Conifers, the cone-bearing and mostly evergreen plant species often marketed as Christmas trees for their classic looks, need to adjust to near-freezing temperatures for several weeks to enter their \"dormant\" stage before being harvested. Not only are people generally buying Christmas trees\u00a0earlier in the year, milder fall weather gives the crops less time to reach this stage, where they effectively enter a deep sleep and are alive but no longer growing, or growing very minimally.",
      "The transition into dormancy means different things for different trees as they slow down to prepare for winter. Some shed their leaves completely, but Christmas trees instead use this time to absorb water and nutrients from their needles to conserve energy. A Christmas tree may shed its needles soon after being cut down if it is harvested in the midst of this active transition.",
      "\"We're basically stressing the trees out to the extreme,\" Whitehill said. \"They're being kind of killed in a way.\"",

The decision comes after policymakers slashed rates by\u00a00.5 percentage points in September, followed by a\u00a00.25 percentage point drop\u00a0in November.",
      "The Fed has now trimmed rates by 1 percentage point since September, offering relief to Americans carrying credit card balances and other debt.",
      "Fewer rate cuts in 2025",
      "At the same time, the Fed is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections. The central bank is now projecting that the federal funds rate may sit at median level of 3.9% by the end of 2025, up from its earlier forecast of 3.4%.",
      "The Fed is also projecting inflation could be higher in 2025, at 2.5%, than it had expected in September, when it forecast that price increases would slow to 2.1% next year.",
      "\"I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call\" to cut rates, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference when asked about the Fed's decision. \"The slower pace of cuts for next year reflects the higher inflation readings we've had this year.\"",
      "The Fed might opt to skip a rate cut in January, while resuming easing at its March meeting, said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.",
      "\"While the Fed opted to round out the year with a third consecutive cut, its New Year's resolution appears to be for a more gradual pace of easing,\" Watson said.",
      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "The Fed's battle against inflation",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Consumer prices in November rose 2.7% on a yearly basis, fueled by elevated housing and food costs. Given that stubborn inflation, many analysts think the Fed is likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

    "story": [
      "Construction worker, gardener, waiter, painter, realtor \u2014 these are the jobs Mardoel Hernandez has held as a Honduran immigrant living in the U.S. for over 20 years. Hernandez, a teacher who fled his home country in the 1990s, was granted legal status and a work permit under the Temporary Protection Status program.",
      "The program, created by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, allows immigrants to temporarily remain in the U.S. if they're from countries designated as unsafe. TPS allows migrants to apply for work permits and shields them from deportation, but does not offer a pathway to citizenship.",
      "Now, Hernandez is joining other TPS holders across the country in a hunger strike to pressure Mr. Biden to extend protected status for immigrants at risk for deportation, since President-elect Donald Trump has promised to revoke the program upon taking office.",
      "\"We are asking President Biden to leave a strong legacy among the immigrant community and honor his word,\" Hernandez told CBS News. \"He promised us so much.\"",
      "As part of the hunger strike organized by the National TPS Alliance organization, immigrants say until Mr. Biden responds, they will abstain from food in sympathy with the deprivation experienced in their home countries.",
      "\"In 2017, I began packing my bags when Trump canceled TPS for Hondurans.\" Hernandez said. \"My only option now is to rally and hope that Biden will notice and act.\"",
      "During an interview in October with NewsNation, Trump was asked about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, and whether he'd revoke TPS.",
      "\"Absolutely, I'd revoke it, and I'd bring them back to their country,\" he responded. This followed debunked claims from Trump on the campaign trail that Haitian immigrants living in Springfield were killing and eating pets of local residents.",
      "\"President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement, when asked what Trump plans to do with TPS holders and whether these immigrants would be part of his overall deportation plans.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver.\" Leavitt said. But she did not address what the Trump administration plans to do with migrants who have temporary legal U.S. status.",
      "According to the latest data, there are over 850,000 TPS holders, as of March 2024. Around 350,000 Venezuelans, 200,000 Haitians and 180,000 Salvadorans make up the largest group of beneficiaries.",
      "Approximately 300,000 TPS holders reside in Florida, while Texas has nearly 95,000, and New York and California each have around 68,000.",
      "TPS holders are provided renewable relief for up to six, 12 or 18 months, but without an extension, many will begin losing their legal status in 2025. Protections for Salvadorans are set to expire first in March, with Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan in April, and Nicraragua in July.",
      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",
      "Since Trump won the election, Vasquez says he has been taking questions at the Salvadoran consulate in Dallas from TPS holders who will be among the first to see their status expire in March.",
      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",
      "With critical deadlines looming, on Dec. 9, a group of senators sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to protect long-settled immigrants before Trump's inauguration with key action steps.",
      "Sens. Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tammy Duckworth, Mazie Hirono, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Alex Padilla asked the president to redesignate and extend TPS for all eligible countries. The senators stressed that \"worsening crises across the world,\" including in Ukraine and Nicaragua, underscore the need for continuing the protected status.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has conferred the status on nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Nepa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ukraine.",
      "Soledad Miranda, a Salvadoran TPS holder, also joined the hunger strike in Washington, D.C., urging Mr. Biden to issue an extension before he leaves office. She fears deportation and being separated from her U.S.-born daughter.",

    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "In its Dec. 6 ruling, the appeals court determined that the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese government's collection of Americans' data and the ability for it to covertly manipulate content on the platform constitute a \"compelling national security interest.\" The court called the government's concerns \"well founded,\" pushing back on TikTok's arguments that the risks were speculative.",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized its decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote for the court. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "When it challenged the law in May, TikTok asserted that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. The petition said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved the mammoth $895 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday, despite concern from some Democrats over a controversial policy restricting gender-affirming care for children of servicemembers.",
      "In a 85 to 14 vote, the Senate approved the legislation, which the House passed last week. Eleven Democrats and three Republicans voted against it in the upper chamber. The bill now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The 1,800 page national security legislation to authorize funding for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2025. But the bill includes a handful of controversial policies, like the gender-affirming care restriction, and lost support from the majority of Democrats in the House.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate pushed forward with the measure nonetheless. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that while the NDAA \"isn't perfect,\" it still \"includes some very good things that Democrats fought for\" \u2014 citing provisions aimed at standing up against the Chinese Communist Party, boosting the use of artificial intelligence for national defense and expanding domestic tech innovation.",
      "\"Congress has passed the NDAA on a bipartisan basis for over six straight decades, and this year will be no different,\" Schumer said ahead of the vote on Wednesday. \"We're passing the NDAA and that's a very good thing.\"",
      "Sen.

      "Still, the outcome of the vote was all but guaranteed after the Senate advanced the measure on Monday in a 83-12 procedural vote.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, celebrated the NDAA's \"immense accomplishments,\" including a 14.5% pay raise for junior service members and investments in recruitment capabilities.

      "\"I share many of my colleagues' frustrations that the bill includes a provision that would prohibit gender-affirming health care for minors under certain circumstances,\" Reed noted, adding that he voted against the provision in committee. \"We will continue to work to ensure the health care rights of all military personnel and their dependents.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee quietly voted to release its\u00a0report on the investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz regarding allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, reversing course after Republicans originally blocked its release.",
      "Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. A source with direct knowledge of the process said the vote was taken on Dec. 5.",
      "The report will likely be unveiled in the coming days, after the final votes of the 118th Congress, the sources said. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to approve new government funding and avoid a shutdown before heading home for the holidays.\u00a0CNN first reported on Thursday that the committee voted behind closed doors earlier this month to release the report.",
      "Republicans in the full House recently blocked\u00a0two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the Ethics Committee to release the potentially damaging report on its investigation into Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to\u00a0nominate\u00a0Gaetz to be attorney general in November. But Gaetz soon withdrew from consideration, facing a likely contentious confirmation process. Gaetz has said he does not intend to take the oath of office for the same seat in the 119th Congress, and is launching a new show on the pro-Trump One America News Network in January.",
      "It's highly unusual, but not unprecedented, for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on a member who is no longer in office. In other investigations, the prospect of a report's release has been enough to prompt the target of the probe to resign from Congress to keep it under wraps. Senior lawmakers, including some Democrats, have expressed concerns about the precedent set by unveiling the Gaetz findings after he has already stepped down.",
      "In June, the committee\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying it was investigating allegations against Gaetz that included sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and bribery.",
      "Multiple sources at the time told CBS News that\u00a0four women\u00a0had informed the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties that included sex and drugs, and that Gaetz had also attended. The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",
      "The House Ethics Committee declined to comment. Gaetz released a lengthy statement on X in response, saying he \"probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked\" more than he should have, but did nothing illegal.",
      "\"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated \u2014 even some I never dated but who asked,\" he wrote. \"I dated several of these women for years. I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court \u2014 which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "He said the Ethics investigation relied on witnesses that the Justice Department \"deemed not-credible.\"",
      "\"I've had no chance to ever confront any accusers. I've never been charged. I've never been sued,\" he wrote. \"Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "Some of the sexual misconduct allegations under review by the committee were the subject of a previous Department of Justice probe into Gaetz. Federal investigators sought to determine if Gaetz violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws, but\u00a0no charges were filed.",

      "The case, known as Kerr v. Edwards, stems from the state's decision in 2018 to end Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's participation in its Medicaid program. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, directed the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services and end their Medicaid agreements.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates two facilities in the state, one in Charleston and the other in Columbia, and provides hundreds of Medicaid patients with services like physicals, cancer and other health screenings, pregnancy testing and contraception. Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "Planned Parenthood and one of its patients, Julie Edwards, sued the state, arguing that cutting off its funding violated a provision of the Medicaid Act that gives beneficiaries the right to choose their provider.",
      "A federal district court blocked South Carolina from ending Planned Parenthood's participation in its Medicaid program, and a U.S. appeals court upheld that decision, finding that Edwards could sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-provider requirement.",
      "The legal battle has already been before the Supreme Court in the past, with the high court last year ordering additional proceedings after deciding in a separate case that nursing home residents could sue their state-owned health care facility over alleged violations of civil rights.",
      "After reconsidering its earlier decision, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously in March that Edwards' lawsuit against the state could go forward and said South Carolina couldn't strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funds.",
      "\"This case is, and always has been, about whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider.

The report in September happened shortly after more than 100 U.S. soldiers were deployed temporarily to Alaska's remote Shemya Island in response to a spike in Russian military activity off the western boundaries of North America, which a U.S. general described as an exercise to test the military's readiness to deploy troops and equipment.",

It takes on a number of priorities for lawmakers, from extending telehealth flexibility under Medicare to a five-year reauthorization of legislation aimed at combatting the opioid crisis and a measure to prevent pandemics.

    "summary": "An Indiana man, Joseph Corcoran, convicted of killing four people including his brother and his sister's fianc\u00e9 decades ago was put to death, without any independent witness, marking the state's first execution in 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan City, Indiana \u2014 An Indiana man convicted of killing four people including his brother and his sister's fianc\u00e9 decades ago was put to death Wednesday, without any independent witness, marking the state's first execution in 15 years and the 24th in the U.S. this year.",
      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, was pronounced dead at 12:44 a.m. CST at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, the Indiana Department of Correction said in a statement. CBS Indianapolis affiliate WTTV reports that officials said the execution process started just after midnight.",
      "Corcoran was scheduled to be executed with the powerful sedative pentobarbital, but the state agency's statement didn't mention that drug.",
      "The state provided limited details about the execution process, and no media witnesses were permitted under state law.",
      "However, Corcoran chose a reporter for the Indiana Capital Chronicle as one of his witnesses, the outlet's editor posted on X early Wednesday.",
      "Four people viewed the execution through a window in a small adjacent room, said Corcoran attorney Larry Komp. He said he, a reporter from Indiana Capital Chronicle and two family members were witnesses. The death itself took eight minutes, but Komp said he only had a partial view and he could not hear anything, including any last words.",
      "According to WTTV,\u00a0 the state agency's statement said Corcoran's last words were, \"Not really. Let's get this over with.\"",
      "Komp said \"there was no way to tell\" if Corcoran was in pain.",
      "Indiana and Wyoming are the only two states that don't allow members of the media to witness state executions, according to a recent report by the\u00a0Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "According to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, witnesses were only allowed to watch the execution for six minutes before blinds to the viewing room were closed. Corcoran, whose pastor was allowed in the room with him during the execution, \"appeared awake with his eyes blinking, but otherwise still and silent,\" the newspaper said.",
      "Corcoran was convicted in the July 1997 shootings of his brother, 30-year-old James Corcoran, his sister's fianc\u00e9, 32-year-old Robert Scott Turner, and two other men, Timothy G. Bricker, 30, and Douglas A. Stillwell, 30.",
      "According to court records, before Corcoran fatally shot the four victims he was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, home he shared with his brother and sister.",
      "While jailed for those killings, Corcoran reportedly bragged about fatally shooting his parents in 1992 in northern Indiana's Steuben County. He was charged in their killings but acquitted.",
      "Last summer, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced plans to resume state executions following a yearslong hiatus marked by a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide.",
      "Corcoran's attorneys had fought his death penalty sentence for years, arguing he was severely mentally ill, which affected his ability to understand and make decisions. This month, his attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but the request was denied.",
      "Corcoran exhausted his federal appeals in 2016. But his attorneys asked the U.S. District Court of Northern Indiana last week to stop his execution and hold a hearing to decide if it would be unconstitutional because Corcoran has a serious mental illness. The court declined to intervene Friday, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit did the same Tuesday.",
      "Corcoran's attorneys then asked the U.S. Supreme Court issue an emergency order halting his execution, but the high court denied their request for a stay late Tuesday, ending Corcoran's options with the courts.",
      "Komp said that he was disappointed with the high court's decision, adding that the question of Corcoran's mental health was not properly evaluated.",
      "\"There has never been a hearing to determine whether is he competent to be executed,\" he said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"It is an absolute failure for the rule of law to have an execution when the law and proper processes were not followed.\"",
      "Corcoran's sole remaining hope then became Holcomb, who could have commuted Corcoran's death sentence. But that commutation never came and the execution proceeded as scheduled.",
      "At midnight, a group of activists who oppose the death penalty began singing \"Amazing Grace.\"",
      "Holcomb issued a statement saying\u00a0Corcoran's case \"has been reviewed repeatedly over the last 25 years \u2013 including 7 times by the Indiana Supreme Court and 3 times by the U.S. Supreme Court, the most recent of which was tonight. His sentence has never been overturned and was carried out as ordered by the court.\"",
      "Indiana's last state execution was in 2009 when Matthew Wrinkles was put to death for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994.",
      "Since then, 13 executions were carried out in Indiana, but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison in Terre Haute.",
      "State officials have said they couldn't continue executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable.",
      "For years, there has been a shortage across the country because pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell their products for that purpose. That's pushed states, including Indiana, to turn to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs specifically for a client. Some use more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause intense pain.",
      "Religious groups, disability rights advocates and others have opposed his execution. About a dozen people, some holding candles, held a vigil late Tuesday to pray outside the prison, which is surrounded by barbed wire fences in a residential area about 60 miles east of Chicago.",
      "\"We can build a society without giving governmental authorities the right to execute their own citizens,\" said Bishop Robert McClory of the Diocese of Gary, who led the prayers.",
      "Other death penalty opponents also demonstrated outside the prison Tuesday night, some holding signs that read \"Execution Is Not The Solution\" and \"Remember The Victims But Not With More Killing.\"",
      "\"There is no need and no benefit from this execution. It's all show,\" said Abraham Borowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, his organization that protests every execution in the U.S.",
      "Prison officials said in a brief statement Tuesday evening that Corcoran \"requested Ben & Jerry's ice cream for his last meal.\"",
      "Corcoran said farewell late Tuesday to relatives, including his wife, Tahina Corcoran, who told reporters outside the prison that they discussed their faith and their memories, including attending high school together. She reiterated her request for Indiana's governor to commute her husband's death sentence.",
      "Tahina Corcoran said her husband is \"very mentally ill\" and she didn't think he fully grasped what was happening to him.",

    "story": [
      "Continuing a decades-long effort to change the nation's bankruptcy system, Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to propose legislation on Wednesday aimed at making the process less costly and complicated for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who seek court-sanctioned relief from debt each year.",
      "\"People typically file for bankruptcy for one of three reasons: a job loss, a medical problem or a family breakup \u2014 and when they do, they're faced with an expensive and complicated system,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement in reintroducing the bill, known as the \"Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act.\"",
      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",
      "Bankruptcies rising",
      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate. The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the AFL-CIO, a labor union, and consumer advocacy groups Public Citizen and National Consumer Law Center.",
      "\"Big corporate debtors continue to reap the rewards of our broken bankruptcy system while everyday Rhode Islanders facing financial hardship struggle to obtain basic relief. I'm pleased to support this bill that makes the consumer bankruptcy system fairer and easier to access for those facing crushing personal debt,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.",
      "Among other things, Warren's proposal would provide two routes for individuals to file for bankruptcy:",
      "No-payment discharge. For low-income filers, this option would wipe out unsecured debt other than child support or debts incurred by fraud.Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",

      "Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",
      "The change would be a welcome one, according to advocates, who say the current bankruptcy rules can steer people in the wrong direction.",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where the filer's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in three to six months.",
      "With a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, payments can be spread out, but the overall costs for filers is significantly higher, running an average of $4,500. Only about a third of people who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged, research shows.",

      "Their excavation unearthed additional fossils, including a full, well-preserved adult jaw and fragments of rib and toe bones that once belonged to a mastodon \u2014 ancient giants that existed during the Ice Age and became extinct some 10,000 years ago. The term refers to a group of massive elephant-like species, like the mammoth.",

      "The mastodon fossils will undergo carbon dating and analysis to determine the creature's age, diet and habitat while it was alive, the museum said. After that analysis and subsequent preservation work are complete, the bones will be featured on public display in 2025.",

      "He urged Putin to negotiate to end the war in Ukraine, saying even \"the worst deal would be better than war.\"",

    "summary": "A British court has cleared police to seize $3.3 million from misogynist social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother to cover unpaid taxes.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A court in the United Kingdom ruled Wednesday that police could seize the equivalent of $3.3 million in frozen financial assets from misogynist social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan to cover years of unpaid taxes.",
      "The money has been held in seven bank accounts, frozen by British authorities, belonging to Tate, who previously lived in the U.K., his brother Tristan and a woman identified by the British authorities only as J.",
      "Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring at the Westminster Magistrates' Court said in his Wednesday ruling that transactions made by the brothers, including transfers amounting to almost $12 million to J, had been a \"straightforward cheat\" to evade tax authorities.",
      "Lawyers for the Devon and Cornwall Police force had argued that Tate and his brother were serial tax evaders who paid no taxes on around $26.5 million in revenue from their online businesses.",
      "According to the French news agency AFP, lawyer Sarah Clarke, who represented the police force, quoted during the proceedings  from a video posted online by Tate, in which he said: \"When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.\"",
      "Tate railed against the ruling, accusing the government of \"outright theft.\"",
      "\"This is not justice; it's a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system,\" he said in a statement, claiming the seizure of his assets raised \"serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.\"",
      "The Associated Press quoted a lawyer for the men, Martin Evans, as defending the bank transfers in question as \"entirely orthodox\" for the owners of online businesses.",
      "Tate gained millions of followers online before being banned by TikTok, Facebook and YouTube when the platforms accused him of posting misogynistic hate speech.",
      "Tate and his brother are currently under house arrest in Romania, where they face criminal human trafficking charges. When that case is concluded, the brothers are set to be extradited to the U.K., where they face additional allegations of human trafficking and rape.",
      "The Tate brothers have denied all the charges of sexual violence and human trafficking.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:22:56 -0500",
    "summary": "A new Pentagon report says China is continuing to expand its nuclear force and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",
      "That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers \"unsafe\" flights near American and allied forces in the region.",
      "The Pentagon's national defense strategy is built around the assessment that China poses the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future.",
      "Corruption within the PLA has resulted in the ouster of at least 15 high-ranking officials in a major shakeup of China's defense establishment.",
      "\"This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing's confidence,\" the report said.",
      "In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry.",
      "The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area.",
      "Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China.",
      "Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027.",
      "The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion.",
      "The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.",
      "More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but \"made uneven progress toward its 2027\" milestone for modernization.",
      "One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are \"quickly approaching U.S. standards.\"",
      "Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",

    "summary": "The \"Frankfurt Silver Inscription\" shows the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered an inscribed silver amulet that one theologian now says may rewrite the history of Christianity north of the Alps mountain range.",
      "The inscribed amulet was found buried in a grave in Frankfurt, Germany in 2018,\u00a0according to a news release from the city. The amulet is just over an inch in size, the city said, with an inscribed thin silver foil rolled up inside. It took years to determine what the inscription said: It had to be deciphered by a computer scan because the foil was too fragile to unroll. The so-called \"Frankfurt Silver Inscription\" was presented to the public earlier in December.",
      "The inscription was determined to be a statement of faith in Jesus Christ, written in Latin. The statement shows that the wearer \"was clearly a devout Christian, which is absolutely unusual for this time,\" the city said.",
      "Researchers dated the grave where the amulet was found to between 230 and 270 AD. This is the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, the city said: All other finds are several decades younger, with \"reliable evidence\" of the religion in the region dating back to the 4th century.",
      "The inscription mentions no religion besides Christianity, which researchers said is unusual. Up until the 5th century, these kind of amulets \"always contain a mixture of different faiths,\" such as Judaism or paganism. Instead, it is entirely based on Christianity. At one point the invocation \"Holy, holy, holy!\" is present. Researchers previously had dated that invocation no earlier than the 4th century. The amulet also included quotations from the Bible used by Christians at that time.",
      "\"The 'Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,\" city mayor Mike Josef said in a translated statement. \"It will force us to turn back the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city: we can be proud of that, especially now, so close to Christmas. Those involved have done a great job.\"",
      "Researchers said that this find will lead to a reevaluation of the burial ground where the amulet was uncovered. It will also lead to a revision of ideas about Christianity north of the Alps.",
      "German church historian Ulrich Volp told the Evangelical Press Service that the amulet can be used to help understand how Christianity spread through the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, even amid persecution.",
      "\"The significance of the discovery can hardly be overestimated,\" Volp said.",
      "The news comes about six months after a experts in Germany said a newly deciphered manuscript dating back 1,600 years was determined to be the oldest record of Jesus Christ's childhood.",

    "story": [
      "An improvised land mine apparently planted by a drug cartel killed two Mexican soldiers and wounded five others, Mexico's defense secretary said Tuesday. Before the blast, the soldiers had discovered the dismembered bodies of three people, officials said.",
      "Gen. Ricardo Trevilla acknowledged that the army had already suffered six deaths from such improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, between 2018 and 2024. But he didn't specify whether those six had been killed by bombs dropped from drones, or by buried roadside bombs, both of which have been used by gangs in Mexico.",
      "Trevilla said that devices like the one that exploded Monday were \"very rustic,\" and officials in the past have described them as similar to buried pipe bombs. There was no immediate information on the condition of the five wounded in the attack, which included at least one officer.",
      "Trevilla's description of the location where the two soldiers died Monday in the western state of Michoacan\u00a0suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly drug cartel booby trap.",
      "Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports that there was an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they descended and had to approach on foot.",
      "While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers.",
      "Trevilla blamed the blast on the United Cartels, an umbrella group that includes the local Viagras gang, which has been fighting bloody turf battles against the Jalisco cartel in Michoacan for years.",
      "In August, the Mexican army acknowledged that some of its soldiers have been killed by bomb-dropping drones operated by drug cartels.",
      "Previously, officials have said the army encounters far more roadside bombs than drone-dropped ones.",
      "The Jalisco drug cartel\u00a0has been fighting local gangs for control of Michoacan for years, and the situation has become so militarized that the warring cartels use roadside bombs or IEDs, trenches, pillbox fortifications, homemade armored vehicles and sniper rifles.",
      "Nemesio Oseguera-Cervantes, also known as \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco cartel, which the officials described as \"one of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking organizations.\" The United States and the State Department has offered a\u00a0$10 million reward\u00a0for his capture.",
      "In the only previous detailed report on cartel bomb attacks in August 2023, the defense department said at that time that a total of 42 soldiers, police and suspects were wounded by IEDs in the first seven and a half months of 2023, up from 16 in all of 2022.",
      "Overall, 556 improvised explosive devices of all types - roadside, drone-carried and car bombs - were found in 2023, the army said in a\u00a0news release last year.",

      "Investigators believe Lopez Serrano ordered the hit because he was angry about information published by Valdez about the Sinaloa Cartel's internal power struggles.",
      "Mexico has made several extradition requests for Lopez Serrano, who surrendered to U.S. authorities in July 2017 for drug trafficking and cooperated in exchange for a reduced sentence. At the time, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Lopez Serrano was \"believed to be the highest-ranking Mexican cartel leader ever to self-surrender in the United States.\"",
      "He was released from prison on parole in 2022.",

      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",
      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",

      "The FSB said the suspect had been promised a reward of $100,000 and permission to move to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. It said that, acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He then placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance of the residential building where Kirillov lived.",

      "In March 2023, about a year into Russia's full-scale invasion, the U.S. State Department said Kirillov had \"significantly increased his media engagement\" to issue repeated, baseless claims that the U.S. government had been involved in creating both the mpox virus and COVID-19, and that the U.S. \"is developing biological weapons able to selectively target ethnic groups.\"",
      "\"The U.S. Government is concerned that this false narrative may be a prelude for a false-flag operation, where Russia itself uses biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and then attempts to blame it on Ukraine and/or the United States,\" the State Department said at the time.",
      "Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat.",
      "Kirillov was sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court on Dec. 16 for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine during Russia's military operation in Ukraine that started in Feb. 2022.",
      "Almost three years into Russia's ongoing war, Russian troops have made small but steady advances, adding to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine they already control.",
      "Since Russia invaded, several prominent figures have been killed in targeted attacks believed to have been carried out by Ukraine.",
      "Darya Dugina, a commentator on Russian TV channels and the daughter of Kremlin-linked nationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin, died in a 2022 car bombing that investigators suspected was aimed at her father.",
      "Vladlen Tatarsky, a popular military blogger, died in April 2023, when a statuette given to him at a party in St. Petersburg exploded. A Russian woman, who said she presented the figurine on orders of a contact in Ukraine, was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison.",
      "In December 2023, Illia Kiva, a former pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia, was shot and killed near Moscow. The Ukrainian military intelligence lauded the killing, warning that other \"traitors of Ukraine\" would share the same fate.",
      "On Dec. 9, a bomb planted under a car in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk killed Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of the Olenivka Prison where dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war died in a missile strike in July 2022. One other person was injured in the blast. Russian authorities said they detained a suspect in the attack.",

    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

The suspect, a man from Vancouver, British Columbia, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder after advanced DNA testing helped authorities link him to the crime.",
      "Lawrence Diehl, now 73, is accused of killing 22-year-old Christopher Smith on April 12, 1996,\u00a0according to\u00a0Ottawa Police. Smith was stabbed to death on the Portage Bridge, which connects Ottawa, the Canadian capital, to Gatineau in the neighboring province of Quebec.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation and reportedly killing at least six people. Casualties were arriving at hospitals and among the buildings seriously damaged in the capital of Port Vila was one that houses the U.S. embassy.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "Katie Greenwood, the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross' Pacific branch, said in a social media post that at least six people had been confirmed dead and many more injured.",
      "The temblor hit just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 35 miles and was centered 18 miles west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that's home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down, but Greenwood of the IFRC said multiple buildings had collapsed and the hospital in the capital was damaged.",
      "Doctors were working \"as fast as they could\" at a triage center outside the emergency ward, journalist Dan McGarry told The Associated Press, adding that the nation wasn't well equipped to deal with a mass casualty event. Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital.",
      "In the first official information published by Vanuatu's government, the Geohazards Department said on social media that its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages. Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours, and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila, including those of the U.S., Britain, France and New Zealand, was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said, but the U.S. Embassy said in a message posted on its Facebook page that all staff were safe, though the building was closed until further notice.",
      "The U.S. mission only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "A video posted on social media showed the building with some damage, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground.",
      "The French news agency AFP said its photos showed the ground floor of the diplomatic building completely flattened. The bottom floor \"no longer exists,\" Vanuatu resident Michael Thompson told AFP by satellite phone after posting images of the destruction on social media. \"It is just completely flat. The top three floors are still holding but they have dropped.\"",
      "\"There's people in the buildings in town. There were bodies there when we walked past,\" Thompson said. The quake also knocked down at least two bridges and toppled other buildings, he said.",
      "McGarry, the journalist, said a \"massive landslide\" at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway was also damaged, he said.",
      "Vanuatu's position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6 aren't uncommon, and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",
      "\"I think it could have been worse,\" McGarry said. But this was the most serious he had experienced during 21 years in Vanuatu, \"by a long shot,\" he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport couldn't be contacted Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",

      "Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.",
      "Cambodia's government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Weapons of war accumulated by the toppled Assad regime over half of a century are being systemically obliterated by massive Israeli airstrikes.",
    "story": [
      "Damascus\u00a0\u2014 A CBS News team drove through a Syrian military airbase on the outskirts of capital city Damascus Monday, and the devastation caused by Israeli air strikes was abundantly clear. Israel has said it's determined to destroy weapons and other military hardware that ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his father spent half of a century accumulating, before it can fall into the hands of extremists.",
      "The Israeli military has pounded Syrian military infrastructure relentlessly since Assad fled to Russia earlier this month \u2014 forced out by a shock rebel offensive after a decade of civil war that had, until about two weeks ago, largely ground to an apparent stalemate.",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "The damage inflicted on Assad's old war machine has been staggering. One strike overnight in the coastal city of Tartus, for instance, was so massive that the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group quoted a scientist in Turkey as saying it had registered on the Richter scale as the equivalent of a category-3 earthquake.",
      "Until Moscow's ally Assad fled from Syria, Russia maintained its only major naval base outside of Russian territory in Tartus. Satellite imagery (below) showed most of the Russian ships disappearing from the Tartus port quickly after Assad fell, but the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that it was still figuring out what to do about its military hardware and personnel in the country, in talks with the country's new de-facto rebel rulers.",
      "Israel's military, meanwhile, says it has laid waste to most of Assad's heavy weapons and air defenses. In a statement on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that in recent days its fighter jets had \"inflicted severe damage on Syria's most strategic weapons: fighter jets and helicopters, Scud missiles, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea precision-guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, radars, rockets, and more.\"",
      "The IDF said its strikes had destroyed \"over 90% of the identified strategic surface-to-air missiles\" of the ousted regime.",
      "The lightning takeover of Syria one week ago by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or HTS, has also seen Israeli forces carry out a land incursion that stretches past the occupied Golan Heights region into a previously demilitarized buffer zone inside Syria.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's new de-facto leader, has criticized what he described as Israel's \"uncalculated military adventures,\" and said he and his group \u2014 which, before publicly distancing itself from extremist ideology was an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 was more interested in state-building than opening another conflict with Israel.",
      "The targeting of Syria's military sites has also revealed deep neglect by Assad. Years of corruption and a decade of civil war had hollowed out the nation's armed forces, contributing to his regime's collapse. Much of the hardware left behind by his forces when they surrendered to the rebels or simply shed their uniforms and ran away is old and clearly lacking maintenance.",
      "Assad's office issued the first statement attributed to the deposed leader since he was forced to flee from his country, meanwhile. In it, he claims he never considered resigning nor fleeing, but that he took shelter in the Russian-run air base at Hmeimim as the rebels closed in, and when that facility came under a sustained drone attack, he says an evacuation was ordered on Dec. 8, the day after the HTS rebels took the capital Damascus.",
      "He said he eventually left for Russia as there was nothing else he could do in Syria, lamenting the country's fall \"into the hands of terrorism.\"",
      "The statement was posted to the Syrian Presidency's official channel on the Telegram messaging app, with a note saying it had been posted after several unsuccessful attempts to release it through Arabic and international media outlets. The statement was deleted relatively quickly from the Telegram channel, however, without any explanation, before reappearing there and on the presidency's Facebook page.",
      "While the wider international community is still trying to figure out how to deal with HTS, which has said it will respect Syrians all of religions and appears determined to be viewed as a secular interim administration \u2014 though it has not said what will come next for the country after a three-month transitional period \u2014 Israel and the U.S. have remained focused largely on securing Assad's stockpiled weapons.",
      "For Israel, that has meant the most ferocious airstrikes carried out in Syria in years, and they continued on Monday, just over a week after Assad's sudden departure.",
      "Whoever does end up in control of Syria will inherit a military infrastructure largely in tatters. Judging by the IDF's statement on Monday, claiming its strikes amounted to \"a significant achievement for the Israeli Air Force's superiority in the region,\" that could be exactly as intended.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, one side in a civil war that's torn the African nation apart for more than a year and created one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet, are accused of raping scores of women and girls and using some as sex slaves in a new report by Human Rights Watch. The New York-based rights group says the paramilitary forces' use of sexual violence in the country's South Kordofan state since September 2023 constitutes war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.",
      "HRW lays out the findings of an investigation based on the cases of almost 80 women and girls in a report published Monday, detailing horrific new allegations of abuse in Sudan, where both sides in the civil war had already been accused of war crimes.",
      "Researchers gathered evidence on 79 women and girls between the ages of 7 and 50 whom HRW says were raped, with most incidents occurring at an RSF military base in Dibeibat, near the town of Habila in South Kordofan.",
      "Survivors and witnesses told the group that the men who carried out the attacks were all uniformed RSF forces or members of allied militias.",
      "\"Survivors described being gang raped in front of their families and over prolonged periods of time, including while being held as sex slaves,\" said HRW Associate Crisis and Conflict Director Belkis Wille, who conducted many of the interviews with the survivors.",
      "Ezzaddean Elsafi, a senior RSF adviser, denied the accusations in the HRW report to CBS News, claiming \"people wearing RSF uniforms\" behind the alleged attacks were impersonators, not actual RSF forces.",
      "\"RSF takes this very seriously and will investigate.  We are highly sensitive to sexual violence against women and the perpetrators will be held accountable,\" said Elsafi, denying that the group even has a significant presence in South Kordofan, though acknowledging it has forces \"in the Debibat area,\" near the boarder with North Kordofan state.",
      "\"This is absolutely disinformation,\" he said of the HRW report.",
      "HRW said it had shared a summary of its investigation's findings with the RSF's overall commander, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, but had not received a response.",
      "Wille has spent years documenting sexual violence in conflicts around the world, including by ISIS militants against Yazidi women in Iraq, but she told CBS News, \"What is really astonishing to me after meeting these women and girls is the scope and scale\" of the crimes in Sudan.",
      "CBS News has seen video of the full interview HRW conducted with an 18-year-old woman whom the group identified as Hania. She said she was pregnant in February when RSF fighters burst into her home in Habila and grabbed her, her 17-year-old neighbor and 16 other girls she knew from her neighborhood. She said they were taken in 10 vehicles to the military base in Dibeibat.",
      "When they arrived, Hania said she recognized more than 30 other girls from her town already there, with about 100 fighters holding them captive.",
      "She said when she tried to resist being raped, one of the militants \"started beating me with a metal whip.\" Over the next three months, she said \"the fighters came in groups of three every morning to take some girls to rape them, and then in the evening another group of three would come and take another set of girls to rape them.\"",
      "Hania said the RSF men held her and the other women and girls in a type of animal pen constructed with wire and tree branches, where they were chained up in groups of ten.",
      "\"What was clear from these cases is that in areas with RSF with control, absolutely nowhere is safe \u2013 not if you flee, or even in your home. Woman and girls are at risk of being raped no matter where,\" Wille told CBS News.",
      "Another woman, Hasina, 35, told HRW that six uniformed RSF men shot and killed her husband and stole all their cattle and money. She said the cows were her family's investment so, with them and her money stolen, she felt she had no means to flee like many of her neighbors had done, and she and her six young children, some just babies, had no choice but to stay in their home.",
      "The RSF fighters returned three days later, she said, and \"all three men raped me, and left.\"",
      "Later that evening, \"three more came back and raped me again and told me to stay in my house.\"",
      "She said she was gang-raped almost every day for the next month before she fled.",
      "HRW met Hasina at Camp Al-Hailu, a makeshift facility with little to no resources for internally displaced civilians in South Kordofan.",
      "\"She really is barely able to wake up and keep going because of what she lived through. Her kids are now in a camp with little food and looked very malnourished when I saw them. \u2026 She is struggling to function as a mother,\" said Wille, adding that women living in tents next to Hasina were helping to care for her kids.",
      "Wille said there was no psychological support for traumatized women in the camp or across much of the country.",
      "\"When I brought up the question of justice and accountability to these women, all of them looked blankly at me, as justice is a meaningless concept to them,\" she said. \"The scale with which it happens here means it's become normalized behavior by the RSF. None of these women have ever heard of a soldier or fighter ever being held accountable.\"",
      "Hania and a friend who was also pregnant managed to escape from their captors. They were interviewed by HRW in the Nuba mountains. They said 49 girls were still being held at the base and she'd heard of girls being held at two other RSF bases, as well.",
      "\"We have no way of finding out more about these women, as access is very difficult and dangerous, and in these areas there is no electricity, no cellphone networks, so no information comes out. There is an absolute silence on these abuses,\" said Wille. \"We will likely never know what happened to these women and girls.\"",
      "The International Rescue Committee charity says the humanitarian crisis driven by Sudan's civil war has been the biggest ever recorded for the second year in a row in 2024, with more than 30 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It's estimated that roughly half of Sudan's 50 million people are suffering from severe hunger.",

      "French authorities said entire neighborhoods \u2014 many of which consisted of poorly constructed slum-settlements \u2014 had been flattened, and public infrastructure including airports and hospitals was badly damaged, the AP reported. Damage to the airport control tower meant only military aircraft could land in Mayotte, complicating the rescue response. Electricity has also reportedly been knocked out across the archipelago.",
      "Rescue workers, soldiers, medical personnel and supplies have been sent from France, as well as from the nearby French territory of Reunion. Mayotte is regarded as the poorest territory that falls under the sovereignty of any European Union nation, however it still draws a significant number of economic migrants from nearby nations that are even poorer, due largely to the French state welfare system being implemented there.",
      "The French Red Cross told CBS News partner network BBC News that around 100,000 people live in makeshift slum dwellings on Mayotte, and that most of those had been completely destroyed by Chido.",
      "Cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean began at the start of December, and Chido hit Mayotte on Saturday as an intense tropical cyclone \u2014 the equivalent of a category-4 hurricane, the BBC reported. It made landfall on the much larger island nation of Madagascar, just south of Mayotte, late Sunday.",
      "The BBC reported that Chido was likely intensified due to climate change.

      "\"I think that people that become as big as I became, when they lose the weight, they're kind of ashamed,\" explained the \"Save Me\" singer, who has lost 100 pounds. \"They're so ashamed that they go and hide and lose the weight, and then they come back out, and they don't really know how to interact with the world, looking different or feeling different, you know? And they kind of got to find their whole new way.\"",

      "\"This is constantly what I'm putting in the air because I want to bring people along with me.\"",

And that most Hollywood stars who have lost a large amount of weight ended up not getting placed in their career.\"",

      "\"What I want the world to know, and I want the people to see, Bunnie, is that I didn't become successful because of my weight, I became successful in spite of it,\" Jelly Roll said definitively. \"I somehow managed to be this successful with carrying 550 pounds. That's insane.\"",
      "Jelly Roll believes his struggle with food surpasses unhealthy habits. \"I used to feel like it was such an injustice to real addicts to call food something you could be addicted to. You know, cause I've seen people fight for their life on heroin,\" the former incarcerated singer shared.",

      "The new research, published in November in the journal Nature, points to epigenetics (genetic activity) that may play a role in regaining weight after weight loss.",
      "What is epigenetics?",
      "\"Epigenetics, which involves chemical markers that influence gene activity without altering the DNA sequence, is crucial in how cells function and respond to environmental factors,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,\u00a0told Fox News Digital.",

      "The researchers investigated what happens to fat cells, which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them. (iStock)",
      "This differs from other cells in tissues, which divide much faster \u2013 intestinal cells, for example, generally divide every other week, he added.",

      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",

      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",

      "\"You heard Mayorkas, who no one believes, we impeached him in the House as you know, the DHS secretary, he said in an interview a couple days ago, well because they changed the regulations to allow drones to fly at night, that's why everybody's seeing them now. They've always been there. I mean, look, people are not buying the answers,\" Johnson said. \"We are digging in further to get the answers, and we're demanding that the administration do its job. We gotta protect Americans, protect our intelligence, of course, and our data and everything else. We're going to get down to the bottom of it, but we don't have the answers yet.\"",
      "Johnson referenced how Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News on Monday that there are thousands of drones flown every day in the U.S., and that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in September 2023 \"changed the rules so that drones could fly at night, and that may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn until dusk.\"",
      "Mayorkas also said it was \"critical\" for Congress to expand authorities for state and local agencies to counter drone activity \"under federal supervision.\"",

      "\"This is why we need Donald J. Trump back in the White House to bring steady hands at the wheel and a strong commander-in-chief,\" Johnson said. \"He would have already had the answers, he would have already delivered to the American people and certainly to members of Congress. So leadership matters. That's why he got the mandate. That's why the American people can't wait for the America First agenda to start, and we can't wait either.\"",

      "Illustration of a scammer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the scam work?",
      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog. Users unknowingly paste and execute a crafted PowerShell command, which silently installs the Lumma info-stealer malware onto their system.",
      "The malware targets sensitive data, including social media accounts, banking credentials, saved passwords and personal files, potentially leading to financial and identity theft.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "Who\u2019s to blame for this?",
      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down. Guardio\u2019s research shows how all these moving parts work together, creating a system where no one takes responsibility, and the scams keep running.",

      "1. Use reliable security software:\u00a0Keeping your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from fake CAPTCHA scams. A strong antivirus software will detect and block malware like the Lumma info-stealer before it can infect your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable browser protection features:\u00a0Modern browsers offer built-in security features, such as Safe Browsing and phishing protection, which warn you about potentially dangerous sites. Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true. Fake CAPTCHA scams often disguise themselves as legitimate ads, asking you to click to verify you're human. Never interact with pop-up ads or unfamiliar banners, especially those that claim to give you something for free, as they may lead to malicious pages or trigger malware downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no question that fake CAPTCHA scams are a growing threat, putting millions of us at risk of malware infections and financial loss. What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem. The companies involved must take immediate action to improve content moderation, tighten security measures and prevent these scams from thriving. We are seeing a dangerous loophole in the digital advertising ecosystem that could have serious consequences for internet users.",

      "They breached the databases of the Center for Vein Restoration (CVR), which claims to be \"America\u2019s largest physician-led vein center,\" stealing not just personal data but also medical records.",

      "CVR, a clinic headquartered in Maryland, experienced a massive data breach where hackers stole highly sensitive personal information, including lab results and health insurance details, as reported by\u00a0Cybernews. The breach occurred in early October, with the clinic detecting \"unusual activity\" in its systems on Oct. 6.",
      "CVR has more than 110 branches across the country, from Alabama to Alaska. This breach has affected hundreds of thousands of individuals. According to a\u00a0notice filed by CVR with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, more than 445,000 people had their personal information compromised.",
      "As the name suggests, CVR specializes in vein restoration, a very specialized procedure aimed at improving the health and function of veins. This means the clinic keeps a very elaborate record of its patients\u2019 health, and now all that is in the hands of hackers, along with copious amounts of personal information.",
      "The full list of exposed data includes addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical record numbers, diagnoses, lab results, medications, treatment information, health insurance information, provider names, dates of treatment and financial information.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The risks associated with the CVR data breach",
      "The risks of data breaches depend on the type of company affected. For instance, breaches involving companies like Ticketmaster are generally more manageable because they often expose information like contact details, addresses and, in some cases, identification documents. Even if financial data is leaked, it can typically be mitigated by replacing or blocking compromised accounts.",
      "Health care data breaches, however, are far more severe. When companies like CVR are targeted, hackers gain access to sensitive medical records that cannot be altered. Your medical history is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals can use this information to commit identity fraud, such as obtaining prescription drugs through false insurance claims. Plus, detailed knowledge of medical treatments, lab results and medications allows attackers to create highly targeted phishing scams, exploiting victims\u2019 vulnerabilities with alarming precision.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6. Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7. Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it's crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CVR data breach is deeply troubling, affecting nearly half a million individuals and exposing highly sensitive medical and personal information. What makes this breach particularly concerning is the lasting impact health care data leaks can have on victims, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. Whether or not you\u2019ve been directly affected, it\u2019s a stark reminder to take proactive steps, such as monitoring your accounts, enabling multifactor authentication and staying alert to phishing attempts.",

      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "The holiday season is the best time of the year. Many of us spend quality time with our families, enjoy delicious food and even go on vacations. For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase.

      "1) Package delivery scam",
      "With the holiday season in full swing, the end-of-year sales have begun, and you probably have already started your holiday shopping and are expecting packages coming via different types of delivery services like FedEx, UPS or USPS. So, if you receive a text that mentions a package delivery, you may be likely to easily fall for a scam. I was expecting a package recently and received this text out of the blue (see image).",

      "Even though the text says the sender is not in my contact list and that it may be junk, I almost clicked the link because I was so focused on the fact that there may have been a typo in my delivery address. But once I looked a little closer, there were a few red flags in this text message that tipped me off to it being a scam.",
      "First, the link does not lead you to usps.com. It's a fake link that scammers hope you won't notice.\u00a0Notice it is uspsts.top and not\u00a0usps.com. This is a common scam going around called typosquatting wherein a scammer uses a domain that looks close to a real website. Next, the text says \"pls,\" which is lingo for \"please\" that you likely wouldn't see in correspondence from the USPS. Scammers often make typos or use poor grammar when communicating, so always double-check.Scammers are sending emails, texts and even occasionally there could be a phone call that is regarding an issue with package delivery. It may be something like this text I received that has a link where they'll end up asking for information, or you may be asked to pay a \"shipping fee\" to get your package.Be sure to always have strong\u00a0antivirus software running on your devices to prevent any disasters from happening if you were to click on a malicious link.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

You most likely received an email regarding your package, and if you go to that email to get your order number, you should be able to look up the status of your order directly on any website.",

      "8 PHISHING EMAIL SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON",
      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "3)\u00a0Social media gift exchange scam",
      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "THE BEST WAY TO BUY GIFT CARDS EVER",
      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",
      "A woman shopping on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The website address does not match the name of the store or brand.The website has poor design and/or spelling and grammar errors.The website does not have a secure connection\u00a0(https) or a padlock icon in the address bar.The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",

      "The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.",
      "The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",
      "How to avoid falling victim to this scam",
      "By following a few simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scams and ensure a safer shopping experience.",
      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1) If you can regain control of your accounts, change your passwords and inform the account provider",
      "2) Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started",
      "3)\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4)\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5) Get the professional advice of a lawyer",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theftIf being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft",
      "If being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "6)\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7) Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",

      "Holiday decoration theft has become an increasingly frustrating issue for many homeowners. Karen from Los Angeles shared her experience with us in an email, stating,",
      "\"We have criminals who visit our neighborhood to not only steal mail and packages but also holiday decorations. I made a Christmas decoration for our mailbox, which was promptly stolen.\"",
      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",

      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "According to Harbinger, all battery-powered vehicles face challenges in cold weather due to two main factors: reduced battery performance and increased energy consumption for cabin heating. At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

      "Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday vowed to haul suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione back to New York to face newly announced terrorism charges.",
      "Mangione, who remains jailed in Pennsylvania following a dayslong manhunt, was already charged with murder in the Dec. 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside the Hilton Hotel in New York City. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Wednesday announced an indictment tacking on allegations of terrorism. Bragg extended \"heartfelt prayers\" to Thompson's family and said that \"this type of premeditated, targeted gun violence cannot and will not be tolerated.\"",
      "\"Now that @ManhattanDA has filed an indictment for the murder of Brian Thompson, New York stands ready to do whatever it takes to hold the killer accountable,\" Hochul wrote on X Thursday. \"We\u2019ve heard reports that the defendant will waive his extradition rights. If not, I am prepared to request a governor\u2019s warrant as soon as possible to ensure he is held and tried in New York.\"",

      "The killing led to a fiery outpouring of resentment toward U.S. health insurance companies, as Americans swapped stories online and elsewhere of being denied coverage, left in limbo as doctors and insurers disagreed, and stuck with sizable bills.",
      "The shooting also rattled C-suites, as \"wanted\" posters with other health care executives\u2019 names and faces appeared on New York streets, and some social media users extolled Mangione's deed as payback.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Tuesday that \"any attempt to rationalize this is vile, reckless and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice.\"",
      "A New York law passed after the 9/11 attacks allows prosecutors to charge crimes as acts of terrorism when they are \"intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\"",

      "After days of intense police searches and publicity, Mangione was spotted Dec. 9 at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and arrested. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport and various fake IDs, including one that the suspected shooter presented to check into a New York hostel.",
      "The 26-year-old was charged in Pennsylvania on gun and forgery offenses and locked up there without bail. His Pennsylvania lawyer has questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal grounding for the gun charge. The attorney also has said Mangione would fight extradition to New York.",

Since that time, 13 executions have been carried out in the state, but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison.",
      "State officials have said they could not resume executions because the combination of drugs used in lethal injections were unavailable.",
      "There has been a shortage of the drugs across the country for years because pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell them for executions, which forced states, including Indiana, to use compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for clients. Some of these pharmacies use more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both which critics argue can cause intense pain.",

      "\"My guess is they should try some kind of psychiatric defense where it mitigates his intent to do this in the hopes that instead of getting convicted of murder, he gets convicted of manslaughter,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Even if he gets the maximum, which is eight to 24 years ... he could still get out. You know, you may spend 15, 16 to 18 years in, but at least one day you're going to get out.\"",

      "\"Anybody who thinks they're going to win the case based on facts [is] either incompetent or just completely out of their minds,\" Gotlin said. \"There is no way that that could happen, not the way I see the evidence.\"",

Officials also allege a 3D-printed gun and suppressor found on Mangione during his arrest match a description of the weapon used in Thompson\u2019s murder.",

      "Additionally, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said on Dec. 11 that police matched the gun recovered from Mangione in Pennsylvania to shell casings found outside the Hilton where Thompson was gunned down from behind on the sidewalk. They also have his fingerprints on a snack bar wrapper and a water bottle, she said.",

      "Still, others have suggested that the level of planning that appears to have gone into the slaying could make an insanity defense difficult.",
      "\"For example of an extreme emotional distress defense, a guy walks up to somebody on the subway and stabs somebody, then he drops the knife and stands there, and he's got previous mental health issues. He's hearing voices,\" said Louis Gelormino, a New York City criminal defense attorney who previously represented a client who stabbed both of his parents and argued such a defense. \"He's not planning a getaway, he doesn\u2019t have false ID, he doesn\u2019t have a silencer on his weapon. Those are the things that show, no matter what you do, you did know what you were doing.\"",
      "Another mental health option, but not necessarily a defense, would involve arguing that Mangione is unfit to stand trial, Gelormino said. If his lawyers succeed there, he would potentially be hospitalized until he's fit enough to go before the court and then go to trial anyway.",

      "The suspect, who police believe was Mangione, checked into a hostel on the Upper West Side with a fake ID, paid cash and is believed to have escaped the Big Apple within an hour of the slaying.",

      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group/File)",
      "\"Now, it seems to me that, based on what I see in this kid, he clearly had some kind of break with reality,\" Gotlin said. \"Based on what I see, he had everything going for him. And ... I'm not a psychiatrist. I've done other psychiatric cases. I mean, it's conceivable he's developed schizophrenia or some kind of psychiatric disorder over the last several years and is completely delusional.\"",

There is nothing to indicate he was denied coverage, and we know he comes from an affluent background, so money was not an issue.\"",

      "A new report cites a laundry list of alleged errors in the casualty tallies that the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has issued during the conflict in Gaza, and found that worldwide media widely report the inflated numbers with little or no scrutiny.",
      "The Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a U.K. based think tank, found \"widespread inaccuracies and distortion in the data collection process\" for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) which has resulted in a \"misleading picture of the conflict.\" The study also analyzed how journalists worldwide have spread misleading MoH data without noting its shortcomings or offering alternative information from Israeli sources.",
      "The report's author, Andrew Fox, a fellow at HJS said his team\u2019s research is based on lists of casualty figures that the MoH has released through Telegram as well as lists released by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Fox said he and his team have been able to examine segments of the reporting, despite changeable MoH data being \"really hard to interrogate.\"",

      "The report said the ministry's reporting long indicated that women and children made up more than half of the war dead, leading to accusations that Israel intentionally kills civilians in Gaza.",
      "\"If Israel was killing indiscriminately, you would expect deaths to roughly match the demographic proportions pre-war,\" Fox said. At the time, adult men made up around 26% of the Gazan population. \"The number of adult males that have died is vastly in excess of 26%,\" he said.",
      "Within accessible reporting, Fox and his team also found instances of casualty entries being recorded improperly, \"artificially increas[ing] the numbers of women and children who are reported as killed.\" This has included people with male names being listed as females, and grown adults being recorded as young children.",

      "Analyzing data by category has further highlighted biases within reporting. There are three kinds of entries within MoH\u2019s casualty figures: entries collected by hospitals prior to the breakdown of networks in November 2023, entries submitted by family members of the deceased, and entries collected through \"media sources,\" whose veracity researchers like Dr. David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, has previously questioned.",
      "Analysis of gender breakdowns among these groupings shows that hospital records \"are distorted,\" with a higher percentage of women and children among hospital-reported casualties than in those reported by family members.",

      "Though around 5,000 natural deaths typically occur in Gaza each year, the study found that MoH casualty figures do not account for natural deaths. It claims that it also fails to exclude deaths unassociated with Israeli military action from its count. This includes individuals believed to have been killed by Hamas, like 13-year-old Ahmed Shaddad Halmy Brikeh, who appears on a casualty list from August despite reports indicating he had \"been shot dead by Hamas\" while trying to get food from an aid shipment in December 2023. The list also excludes individuals killed by Hamas\u2019 rockets, about 1,750 of which \"fell short within the Gaza strip\" between October 2023 and July 2024.",
      "Fox and his team also found individuals who died before the conflict began had been added to MoH casualty counts. In addition, at least three cancer patients whose names were included in lists to leave the Gaza Strip for treatment in April had been listed as dead during the month of March.",

      "The ministry does not separate combatants and civilians in its casualty figures. Though the study states that Israeli forces have killed around 17,000 Hamas terrorists, Fox said that his research indicated the death toll may include as many as 22,000 members of Hamas. He said his research supports the fact that around 15,000 of the dead in Gaza are women and children, and 7,500 are non-combatant adult males.",
      "\"Collecting these sorts of lists in a war zone is a hugely challenging thing,\" Fox admitted, but he stated that the MoH\u2019s mistakes, whether innocent or deliberate, show that the institution is \"really unreliable.\"",
      "Despite this unreliability, the Henry Jackson Society\u2019s survey of reporting of the conflict found that 98% of media organizations it looked at utilized fatality data from MoH versus 5% who cited Israeli figures. Fox found that \"fewer than one in every 50 articles [about the conflict] mentioned that the figures provided by the MoH were unverifiable or controversial,\" though \"Israeli statistics had their credibility questioned in half of the few articles that incorporated them.\"",

      "As an illustration of the phenomenon witnessed in the survey, Fox pointed out what he called an \"incredibly biased\" article from a British broadcaster that recently emerged citing MoH data claiming that there have been more than 45,000 deaths in Gaza. Though its report mentions MoH data, it does not break down the numbers of combatants and civilians, and does not mention the questionable veracity of MoH reporting. Instead, it parrots MoH claims, reporting that women and children make up for over half of the fatalities.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a great example of everything we\u2019ve written in the report,\" Fox said.",

The rising tensions have deepened the rift between the two nations and sparked concerns over regional stability and the fate of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting ISIS.",
      "On Monday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry criticized Israel for expanding settlements in the Golan Heights, calling it part of Israel\u2019s \"expansion of borders through occupation.\" Turkey urged Israel to comply with the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which established a cease-fire between Israel and Syria.",
      "However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the agreement void, arguing it no longer applied after forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad abandoned their positions on the Syrian side during the country\u2019s civil war.

    "title": "Islamist group running Syria has mixed record over governance in province, ruled with 'iron fist'",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, which toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad, governed Syria&apos;s Idlib province with a mix of repression and pragmatism. Led by Abu Mohamed al-Golani, the group is said to be moderating.",
    "story": [
      "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT. Syria's Bashar Assad has been accused of extreme torture and murder within his prison system. (Getty Images, Reuters, AP)",
      "Following Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, a new government is taking shape in Syria that has many wondering if it will moderate its Islamist stance or, as some have predicted, function like the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
      "The\u00a0U.S.-designated terrorist group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) had been ruling the Idlib Governate in northwest Syria and set up its own regime known as the Syrian Salvation Government and said it had shed its global Jihadist aims for a focus on local governance. In Idlib, HTS created a bureaucratic system and various ministries to administer some public services, including public safety.",
      "\"By all accounts, it has ruled with an iron fist there,\" Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "At its height, HTS ruled over approximately 2 million people in Idlib Province. Its leader, Mohammed al-Golani attempted to rebrand HTS and distance the group from the global jihadist elements of al Qaeda and instead focused on local issues in Idlib.",

      "Questions still remain about how al-Golani would rule all of Syria. Some Syria watchers who monitored the groups record in Idlib caution that HTS was no democratic regime.",
      "Hall, an expert on Syria, said that HTS exhibited mixed behavior in Idlib, including kicking out Christians, although Hall noted that she knows personally of religious minorities, including Alawites, who did live peacefully in Idlib.",
      "Other aspects of their rule in Idlib are more troubling.",

      "ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA",
      "\"In terms of their iron fist, HTS tried to do away with dissent when there were protests against them. It was reported that they had killed a famous political activist, Raed Fares. There were also recent protests in Idlib over people who have died in detention under HTS custody,\" Hall said.",
      "HTS was less than tolerant and known for suppressing political dissent. Hall also noted she personally knows of people who were \"beat up\" by HTS fighters.",
      "Golani did oversee a de-emphasis on strict interpretations of Islam and limited the power of the feared morality police that monitored women\u2019s public wardrobe. The problem now, according to Hall, is not necessarily HTS\u2019 previous record of governance in Idlib, but the power vacuum that is left with Assad ousted.",

      "\"Everyone is going to be grabbing for power and influence,\" Hall said, adding that the U.S. and the West need to mitigate risk and insure a more stable and peaceful future for Syria and deal with the vulnerabilities of each potential governing group.",
      "Tammy Palacios, program manager of the Priority Sustainable Counterterrorism program at the New Lines Institute and who closely monitors Syria, noted that although al-Golani made significant efforts to disconnect from his Jihadist past, moderation at other levels of HTS remains less clear.",
      "HTS security forces were known to \"arrest, judge, torture, detain, and kill individuals as a form of sharia law enforcement\" exercising control in Idlib. Elements of the HTS administration in Idlib also educated and influenced the population in accordance with a hardline interpretation of Sharia law.",
      "SYRIA'S UNACCOUNTED FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS 'EXTREMELY WORRYING,' UN OFFICIAL SAYS",
      "Since toppling the Assad dynasty, HTS set up a transitional government, called the Syrian Salvation Government, and named an interim prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir. HTS leader al-Golani and the interim prime minister met with the former prime minister of Syria during the final months of the Assad regime, Muhammad Ghazi Al-Jalali, who decided to remain in his home in Damascus when the government fell.",
      "During their lightning two-week advance to conquer Syria, HTS promised to protect the rights of all Syrians, regardless of faith or ethnicity, and also promised to protect Shia religious sites. When the rebels finally entered Damascus and Assad fled, al-Golani ordered his fighters not to attack government ministries and, along with Jalali, ensured that the day-to-day work of the government would continue.",

      "Al-Golani, who has a $10 million bounty on his head from the U.S., seeks to present a toned-down version of the radical Islamism that has defined his years of fighting in Syria and in Iraq against American troops. Al-Golani was detained by the U.S. military in the first decade of this century. When the Syrian uprising against Assad broke out, al-Golani built a new organization called Jabhat al-Nusra.",
      "He also had once pledged allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, but he officially broke ties with the group in 2016, and Nusra became HTS in 2017. Many observers of HTS at the time critiqued the break as cosmetic, but al-Qaeda actually condemned the creation of HTS, creating further divides between the groups.",
      "TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL",
      "While HTS governed Idlib in northeast Syria, the group targeted rival Islamist groups, including Ahrar Al-Sham, Hurras Al-Din and other Jihadist groups tied to al Qaeda and ISIS. Much like U.S. negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan, combating terrorism and ensuring that Syria does not become a safe haven for terrorists will be a prerequisite for any recognition by the U.S. and other allies.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Saturday that the U.S. has had direct contact with HTS since it overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad. HTS has already said it would cooperate with the U.S. in the search for Austin Tice, the American journalist missing in Syria since 2012 and who was believed to be held captive by the Assad regime. The initial contact with the rebel group and their promise to work with the U.S. to bring Tice home could further legitimize the group as it looks to consolidate its control over post-Assad Syria.",

      "The U.S. and U.K. are considering whether to remove HTS off its foreign terrorist list, which will be important if HTS consolidates its rule over Syria. Hall says that HTS must establish a checklist to implement in order to get itself removed from the terrorist designation list.",

As the family tried to take refuge in their safe room, the terrorists murdered their eldest daughter, Maayan, in front of her parents and siblings, and then abducted the father, Tzachi. The scene was broadcast live on social media, forcing the nation to witness their agonizing last moments.",

      "\"The use of social media was crucial in spreading the terror, inspiring similar acts of violence elsewhere,\" Merav Israeli-Amarant, CEO of the Civil Commission, told Fox News Digital. She referred to this tactic as the \"terror theater\" a term coined by legal scholar Tehila Schwartz Altshuler, explaining how the broadcasts were designed to radicalize and incite other terrorists.",

The pain is universal. This has happened before, but it never had a name,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy said.",
      "In collaboration with the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, the commission worked to identify these patterns of abuse and ensure that kinocide is recognized as a distinct crime. The new report, released after a year of research, includes interviews with survivors, visits to the sites where the atrocities took place, and an extensive review of evidence.

The dangers of antisemitism are not just the oldest and most lethal of hatreds- they are also a presage of global evil, as evidenced by the events of October 7.\"",

      "Mrad explained to Fox News Digital that while, by his estimate, roughly 70% of the country does not back Hezbollah, the government and the army are not strong enough to completely dismantle the terrorist group or to prevent it from posing a future threat to Israel, a situation that risks a repeat of past failures.",
      "Previous international agreements under U.N. Resolution 1559, signed in 2004, and Resolution 1701, signed in 2006, called for the disarmament and dissolution of all militia groups and for the deployment of U.N. and Lebanese forces to the south of the country to stop Hezbollah from gaining a hold in the areas bordering Israel. Both resolutions failed to be realized.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican chairman said Tuesday that the FBI should investigate former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., over her involvement in the probe from the last Congress of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.",
      "\"Based on the evidence obtained by this Subcommittee, numerous federal laws were likely broken by Liz Cheney, the former Vice Chair of the January 6 Select Committee, and these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" said an interim report released by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., who chairs the House Administration's oversight subcommittee, which investigated the Jan. 6 select committee.",
      "The report alleged Republicans found evidence showing Cheney \"tampered with at least one witness, Cassidy Hutchinson, by secretly communicating with Hutchinson without her attorney's knowledge.\"",
      "\"This secret communication with a witness is improper,\" the report said.",
      "In addition, the report said the FBI should investigate Cheney for allegedly violating a law that prohibits any person from procuring another person to commit perjury, which Republicans have accused Hutchinson of doing in her testimony to the committee.",
      "The report accused Cheney of helping Hutchinson attain new counsel; while the report alleges they spoke directly to each other without a lawyer's knowledge, it indicated Republicans don't seem to know what they discussed.",
      "Cheney said in a statement in response to the report that Jan. 6 showed Trump for who he really is, \"a cruel and vindictive man who allowed violent attacks to continue against our Capitol and law enforcement officers while he watched television and refused for hours to instruct his supporters to stand down and leave.\"",
      "The select committee's 10 public hearings and final report featured numerous Republican witnesses, including many senior officials from the Trump White House, campaign and administration, Cheney noted in the statement. Their testimony was laid out in thousands of pages of transcripts and a \"highly detailed and meticulously sourced\" 800-page report that were made public and whose conclusions the Department of Justice had also reached in a separate investigation, she said.",
      "Loudermilk's interim report \"intentionally disregards the truth and the Select Committee's tremendous weight of evidence, and instead fabricates lies and defamatory allegations in an attempt to cover up what Donald Trump did,\" she alleged. \"Their allegations do not reflect a review of the actual evidence, and are a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",

      "\u201cMs. Hutchinson made the independent decision to part ways with her Trump-funded lawyer, freeing her to provide candid, truthful, and honorable testimony to the January 6th Committee about the attack on the Capitol, alongside dozens of Republican witnesses and law enforcement officers,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite baseless attacks by men with their own agendas to discredit her, Ms. Hutchinson stands by her testimony and remains committed to the truth and accountability.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the report Wednesday, Trump said on Truth Social that Cheney \u201ccould be in a lot of trouble based on the evidence obtained by the subcommittee.\u201d",
      "The president-elect recently suggested in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the members of the Jan. 6 panel should be imprisoned. Those former members, including its Democratic chairman, have said the committee did nothing wrong and did not violate the law.",
      "Hutchinson was considered a star witness for the Jan. 6 committee which was formed in the last Congress under the House Democratic majority and included two Republicans: Cheney, who was the vice chair, and then-Rep. Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois.

      "Hutchinson testified that she was told by White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato that after Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" rally at the White House ellipse, Trump insisted to the Secret Service that he go to the Capitol where he had encouraged his supporters to go afterward. Hutchinson testified that she was told Trump cursed at his security guards after being told they couldn't go to the Capitol, grabbed for the steering wheel of his SUV from the back seat, and then reached for the \"clavicles\" of Bobby Engel, Trump's head of security, who eventually relayed his account to Ornato.",
      "Ornato later told the committee that he did not recall the conversation Hutchinson said they had with Engel.",
      "While Republicans say there have been witnesses who have disputed Hutchinson\u2019s account, it has also been corroborated by others."

    "summary": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Tice's mother Israel won't conduct airstrikes near a secret prison outside Damascus where she believes her son may be",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured the mother of missing American journalist Austin Tice that Israel will not conduct airstrikes near a secret prison outside Damascus where she believes her son may be held, NBC News has confirmed. Debra Tice first discussed the Israeli government\u2019s promise to avoid the area where her son may be in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Tice family and an Israeli official confirmed the Israeli leader\u2019s pledge to Tice, which was conveyed in a letter first reported by Axios.",
      "\u201cIn response to your letter, please rest assured that Israel and its intelligence agencies are fully coordinated with the relevant American authorities on the matter and that the IDF is not active in the area where Austin may be located,\u201d Netanyahu wrote in response to a written request from Debra Tice to the Israeli government this week.",
      "The ousting of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has brought Debra Tice new hope in finding her son, who went missing in the country 12 years ago. She believes Austin Tice may be in Mt. Qasioun prison, which is under a military museum and has a hidden tunnel that has not been fully explored.",
      "\u201cThey were able to go through the tunnel and go up, but in the absence of the bombing, they\u2019ll be able to make a more thorough search inside the mountain,\u201d Tice told MSNBC on Tuesday, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re really searching for the hidden cells, you know, because there are a lot of them.\u201d",
      "NBC\u2019s Richard Engel, reporting on the ground in Damascus, found a cell where a fellow prisoner said Austin had been held as recently as 2022. Debra Tice said she was able to verify that her son was held in that prison. \u201cMy children and I, because of something that was written on the wall, we do think that Austin may have been in that specific cell,\u201d Tice told MSNBC.",
      "The U.S. government does not have personnel on the ground in Syria as a part of the search for Tice, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said this week, but he did not rule out sending U.S. officials if the conditions change. Debra Tice said she has been asking the U.S. to go for 12 years.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re pushing someone to do something they really don\u2019t want to do, you\u2019re not going to get a good job anyway,\u201d Tice said. \u201cThe people that jumped in and got right in there, those are the ones that we want to have working for us.\u201d"

      "Formula 1 driver Sergio P\u00e9rez is officially leaving Red Bull Racing after four years, with the Mexican driver announcing jointly with the team on Wednesday that they\u2019ve reached an agreement to part ways before his contract ends.",
      "The decision opens up a coveted seat to become reigning four-time world champion Max Verstappen\u2019s teammate.",
      "In a statement that aims to convey an amicable parting, the 35-year-old P\u00e9rez thanked the team and wished them \u201call the best for the future.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful for the past four years with Oracle Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing Team. Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I\u2019ll always cherish the successes we achieved together,\u201d he said. \u201cA special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We\u2019ll meet again soon. And remember\u2026 Never give up.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez\u2019s exit comes after a poor season in which he failed to muster any victories for the first time in his four years with Red Bull. He struggled to get on top of the evolving car and finished a lowly eighth in the championship, while teammate Verstappen finished first. Rumors of an early exit \u2014 despite having a contract for next year \u2014 have circulated for months.",
      "P\u00e9rez doesn't have a racing seat for next season, and the move could be the end of his Formula 1 career, which began in 2011.",

      "\u201cHis five wins, all on street circuits, were also a spectacular mark of his determination to always push to the limit. While Checo will not race for the Team next season, he will always be an extremely popular Team member and a treasured part of our history,\u201d Horner said.",
      "P\u00e9rez\u2019s highlights with the team include a thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle in 2021 with Mercedes\u2019 Lewis Hamilton in the final race of the season, which Verstappen later said helped him win that year\u2019s world championship; as well as victories in circuits on the streets of Monaco, Baku and Saudi Arabia.",
      "Red Bull didn\u2019t reveal who will replace him, saying only: \u201cFurther announcements regarding the Team\u2019s full 2025 line-up will be made in due course.\u201d",
      "Horner recently indicated to F1 reporters that the two candidates to replace P\u00e9rez would be Liam Lawson or Yuki Tsunoda, who currently drive for the Red Bull junior team, called RB, which is known for auditioning drivers for the senior team.",
      "Lawson told NBC News last month he\u2019d embrace the opportunity to drive for Red Bull alongside Verstappen.",
      "\u201cI have no idea if that\u2019s possible or not, but obviously that\u2019s my goal \u2014 to be in Formula 1 full time, and obviously I\u2019m here to try and win a world championship as well, and the best place to do that is at Red Bull,\u201d Lawson said while adding that there was \u201cno time frame\u201d for such a decision.",
      "He said his goal was simply \u201ctrying to secure a seat next year, wherever that may be, and then in the future, obviously, the goal is to go to Red Bull.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first severe case of bird flu in a human. The patient is hospitalized in Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "A person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with bird flu \u2014\u00a0the country\u2019s first severe human H5N1 infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe patient is experiencing severe respiratory illness related to H5N1 infection and is currently hospitalized in critical condition,\u201d said Emma Herrock, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Health.",
      "The CDC said the patient was likely exposed to the virus from a backyard flock, which would mark the first time such a flock has been associated with a bird flu infection in a U.S. resident.",
      "\u201cWhile an investigation into the source of this infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it is believed that the patient that was reported by Louisiana had exposure to sick or dead birds on their property,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during a briefing Wednesday.",
      "The case was reported as a presumptive positive by Louisiana on Friday and later confirmed by CDC laboratory testing.",
      "Daskalakis said the Louisiana Department of Health was conducting an investigation, monitoring the patient's contacts for exposure and offering testing and antiviral medication as needed.",
      "The patient is over the age of 65 and had underlying medical conditions, Herrock said. She did not address questions about the patient's symptoms or the backyard flock.",
      "In the United States this year, 61 human cases of avian influenza have been reported. No person-to-person transmission has been documented so far. Most cases have been mild and found among farmworkers exposed to the virus through interactions with infected poultry or cattle. Common symptoms in earlier cases have included pinkeye, coughs and sneezing.",
      "Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who studies infectious diseases, said the Louisiana case highlights the risks of exposure outside of farms.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on dairy workers and poultry workers, but an emerging risk is handling dead birds in your backyard,\u201d he said.",
      "Daskalakis said that the CDC is still working to better characterize the virus\u2019s genome, which will help researchers understand whether it has developed any concerning mutations that might allow it to spread from person to person.",
      "Early indicators in the Louisiana case suggest that the version of virus causing the infection is similar to what has been circulating in wild birds and poultry in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state.",
      "A teenager in British Columbia was hospitalized in November after contracting the same genotype of the bird flu virus. Canadian health officials were not able to determine the source of the teen's infection.",
      "\"What this illustrates is people can get really sick from bird flu, and to me it\u2019s related to the case in British Columbia,\" Chin-Hong said. \"These patients are both united by the same variant.\"",
      "The CDC said the development does not change its assessment of H5N1's immediate risk to public health, however, which it says remains \"low.\"",
      "H5N1 began circulating widely among wild birds in the U.S. in 2022 then spread to poultry farms and backyard flocks. At least 123 million birds have been killed or euthanized because of the virus since 2022, according to the CDC.",
      "This spring, bird flu began to spread among dairy cows, and at least 16 states have since detected the virus in cows.",
      "Research on dairy farms has shown the\u00a0virus can spread efficiently between mammals. Scientists have found that it likely spreads between farm animals through raw milk because infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands.",
      "Although there is no evidence of the virus spreading between humans, scientists are concerned that it could mutate and develop that ability, which could touch off the next pandemic.",
      "In the U.S., there have been two cases so far in which health officials could not determine the source of a person's exposure to bird flu. One was an infection in a California child reported in November. The other was in a hospitalized patient in Missouri, who tested positive for H5N1 in August and recovered.",
      "Daskalakis said the CDC considers the Louisiana case the first severe H5N1 infection because other conditions likely caused the hospitalization of the Missouri patient."

      "\u201cThis kind of vile and heinous hate-fueled violence, intended to target innocent people based on their sexual orientation, runs contrary to our values as Americans,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement included in the release. \u201cBias-motivated crimes targeting the LGBTQI+ community will not be tolerated.\u00a0 The Justice Department will continue using every tool at our disposal to protect communities from the scourge of hate-fueled violence by prosecuting those who carry out or attempt to carry out such crimes.\u201d",
      "Officials said Davis researched and wrote about dozens of mass killers in journals, on other items in his home and on social media between July of last year and June, when he was arrested on an unrelated charge. In those 11 months, Davis drafted a list of weapons he owned and weapons he intended to acquire to carry out his own mass killing, officials said. By June, he had amassed an arsenal that included two firearms, magazines, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a crossbow and arrows, assorted bomb-making parts, smoke grenades, tactical gear and several knives, officials said. One of his knives was inscribed with an anti-gay slur, \u201cF----- Killer,\u201d officials said.",
      "Between April and June, Davis posted on social media about opening fire on a local political party\u2019s headquarters, which he said, using an anti-gay slur, was \u201cfilled with far-left liberal, f----- scum,\u201d and a nearby bar that Davis had referred to as a \u201cf----- bar,\u201d according to the DOJ release. Officials did not specify which political party the headquarters belonged to or whether the nearby bar is a gay bar.",
      "In June, Davis also spray-painted the word \u201cfag\u201d on the car of one of his neighbors, whom officials said Davis knew to be gay, and vandalized another car. Days later, Davis test-fired one of his firearms by shooting approximately 60 bullets at several of his neighbors\u2019 properties, including one of the cars he had previously vandalized, officials said.",
      "Police arrested him after the shooting incident and he has remained in custody since June. He will be sentenced for planning the foiled attack at a later, unspecified date, according to the release.",

      "A transgender woman filed a court petition Tuesday against the state of Washington\u2019s Department of Corrections, alleging that her confinement at a men\u2019s prison is unconstitutional.",
      "Amber Kim was transferred to the Monroe Correctional Complex in June after being housed at the Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW) since 2021. It is the first time in Washington state history that a transgender woman has been transferred from a women\u2019s prison to a men\u2019s facility, according to the ACLU of Washington, which filed the petition on Kim\u2019s behalf.",
      "Adrien Leavitt,\u00a0 Kim\u2019s attorney, said the decision to transfer Kim constitutes cruel punishment and \u201cviolates the Washington Constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer placement at a men\u2019s prison creates an objectively significant risk of serious harm and these conditions are not necessary to accomplish any legitimate penological goal,\u201d the court documents stated.",
      "The Washington Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
      "In March, Kim was caught having sex with her cellmate, a cisgender woman, which constitutes a category B \u201cserious violation,\u201d according to the Washington state Department of Corrections handbook.",
      "The sexual act was consensual, according to the court documents, and both Kim and her roommate received security status changes after an infraction hearing. After five weeks, however, the Department of Corrections reversed its decision about Kim being able to remain housed at the corrections center and determined Kim to be a \u201csafety concern.\u201d",
      "In her legal declaration, Kim said she had no major infractions before being caught having sex.",
      "\u201cFor the three-and-a-half years I was housed at WCCW, I used my time there to learn, to grow and to contribute positively to the WCCW,\u201d Kim said in a statement. \u201cBeing singled out for exceptional punishment \u2014 and transferred to a men\u2019s prison \u2014 over a single infraction not only harms me, but every other incarcerated transgender person.\u201d",
      "Kim, now 36, was convicted of aggravated first-degree murder at the age of 19. She \u201cpresented as male\u201d for the first 10 years of her incarceration \u201cbecause of the level of danger\u201d she faced daily, according to court documents. During her more than a decade in men\u2019s prisons, she has experienced \u201charassment, physical violence, and attempted sexual assaults,\u201d according to the filing requesting an expedited review.",
      "The court documents stated that Kim \u201cengaged positively in the community\u201d while at the women\u2019s correctional center, and the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of women were accepting of the transgender women who are housed there.",
      "\u201cWithout the emotional burden of facing constant harassment and spending my time avoiding physical violence, I was able to focus on my mental health, plan for the future, and engage with positive programming,\u201d she wrote in her declaration.",

She now elects to remain there \u201crather than endure the physical and psychological harm that would become her everyday reality if housed in men\u2019s general population,\u201d according to court documents.",

      "The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, a federal law intended to stop sexual assault behind bars, was updated with guidance in 2012 that requires prisons to consider where trans inmates will be housed on a case-by-case basis.

      "Passengers usually save their applause for when the plane lands, but on a United flight on Saturday, they were clapping before the aircraft even left the ground.",
      "That's because United pilot Captain David Whitson boarded Flight 2223 from Houston to Newark shortly before takeoff to greet one heroic passenger, who happened to be his bone marrow donor.",
      "In a video taken by another passenger, Whitson can be seen walking through the cabin to hug passenger Alexandria Reimold, whom he later identifies as his bone marrow donor.",
      "After piloting a separate flight that landed in Houston, he ran over to Reimold's gate to \"say 'hello'\" before her flight took off and \"share their remarkable story with other travelers over the plane\u2019s PA system,\" according to a United Airlines spokesperson.",
      "As they embraced, Whitson told surrounding passengers that Reimold was a \"true hero.\"",
      "He added that Reimold, who was 22 at the time of her donation eight years ago, had been a better match than his own brother.",
      "\"This is the young lady that saved my life,\" Whitson said as passengers seated around the pair cheered over the heartwarming reunion.",
      "Reimold registered as a bone marrow donor at 18-years-old while she was a student at Purdue University, but didn't donate until four years later, according to a United Airlines spokesperson. She and Whitson were both registered with\u00a0NMDP when they matched.",

      "The Cleveland Clinic says that about 30% of all people who need a transplant find a matching donor from someone in their immediate family, but the remaining 70% rely on finding matching donors from someone other than a close family member. Anyone can volunteer to donate bone marrow, but all donors must meet certain health requirements."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 18:13:47 GMT",
    "summary": "ICE is already dealing with a $230 million budget shortfall, even before the costs that will be associated with mass deportations",
    "story": [
      "The incoming Trump administration is already making plans to harness the power of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to vastly increase the number of undocumented immigrants deported from the United States. But it faces an obstacle: ICE is already dealing with a $230 million budget shortfall, even before the costs that will be associated with mass deportations, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the figure.",
      "Even with the continuing resolution spending bill introduced this week in Congress, ICE will continue to face a funding shortfall the officials\u00a0said, because its operations \u2014including detaining and deporting migrants at the current levels \u2014 are outpacing the $8.7 billion annual budget currently allocated to it by Congress.\u00a0The continuing resolution, which is expected to pass this week, will extend current funding levels, including funding for ICE, until March 14.",
      "\u201cWe are running hot,\u201d said the two officials, who spoke separately. They attributed the shortfall to the agency being historically underfunded and the increased need for ICE to remove migrants who are deemed ineligible for asylum, a number which has increased since June, when the Biden administration changed asylum policy.",
      "ICE\u2019s budget shortfall may mean Donald Trump would have to delay his plans to boost the agency and ramp up deportations on the first day of his presidency.",
      "The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration research and advocacy group, estimates Trump\u2019s plan for mass deportations will cost more than $88 billion. Trump himself told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker earlier this month that there is \u201cno price tag\u201d when it comes to carrying out his mass deportation plan.",
      "Congress has only two\u00a0avenues\u00a0to appropriate more funding to ICE in the\u00a0near term\u00a0without an emergency supplemental request from the White House. In January, when Republicans have control of the White House and the Senate and narrow control of the House, negotiations on next year\u2019s spending levels will begin in earnest.",
      "Republicans could appropriate additional funding to ICE as part of the next government spending package, but it would require compromising with Democrats who will almost certainly need to provide votes to pass any bill through regular order.",
      "Republicans have also discussed beefing up funds to ICE using budget reconciliation, a wonky procedural tool that enables the majority to bypass the mandatory 60-vote threshold to pass legislation related to funding. But the effort is already being met with resistance from some in the party who want to save their political capital to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts later in the year.",
      "Both strategies will take some time to muscle through both chambers of Congress, especially with House Speaker Mike Johnson facing an even slimmer majority in the new year. And the internal strife will make Trump\u2019s plan to begin carrying out mass deportations on the very first day of his presidency an even heavier lift.",
      "The two officials also said they believe ICE has been historically underfunded for its wide mission. There are nearly 8 million immigrants on ICE\u2019s docket, one ICE officer for every 7,000 cases, ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner told NBC News in June.\u00a0He said the ratio was \u201cnot good,\u201d and others inside ICE have said it is impossible for agents to keep tabs on all of the migrants\u2019 whereabouts inside the country.",
      "\u201cWe are chronically underresourced and need more funding,\u201d Lechleitner said at the time.",
      "In February, the agency said it might have to consider releasing migrants if it did not get more funding for detention beds coming off of 2023\u2019s record high number of border crossings. The border bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year asked for $9.5 billion and the Biden administration\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget request asked for $9.3 billion for the agency, but those levels have yet to be passed through Congress despite Republicans calling on the administration to increase immigration enforcement."

    "summary": "Experts say Kennedy\u2019s long history of anti-vaccine activism could translate into significant changes to childhood immunization policies in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. meets with Senate Republicans on the Hill this week in an effort to secure his confirmation as secretary of health and human services, his biggest hurdle may be convincing them that he doesn\u2019t hold extreme views on vaccines.",
      "That could prove difficult, however, as Kennedy has spent decades publicly opposing vaccines, including making repeated false claims about vaccines being linked to autism and his involvement with Children\u2019s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine group.",
      "In recent days, concerns over how Kennedy might wield his influence as health secretary have grown. Last week, The New York Times reported that a lawyer for Kennedy who is reviewing candidates for jobs at HHS filed a petition to the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. The petition, the Times said, was on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine group with ties to Kennedy.",
      "On Monday, President-elect Donald Trump added to the controversy, saying during a news conference that he believes there are \u201cproblems\u201d with vaccines and suggesting they may be linked to rising autism rates. Trump said, however, that he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in the polio vaccine.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor and a potential key figure in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, fired a warning shot at Kennedy in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. The polio vaccine was approved in the U.S. in 1955, and it has prevented an estimated 20 million cases of paralysis in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Experts say Kennedy\u2019s long history of anti-vaccine activism could translate into significant changes to childhood immunization policies in the U.S. and could undermine decades of progress in preventing diseases like measles, polio and whooping cough.",
      "A Kennedy spokesperson did not respond to a new request for comment. In an earlier statement to NBC News, Kennedy spokeswoman Katie Miller said, \u201cThe Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s previous comments conflict with that statement, however. On the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d last year, Kennedy said there\u2019s \u201cno vaccine that\u2019s safe and effective\u201d and linked the polio vaccine to cancer.",
      "Advisory committees",
      "Childhood vaccination policies in the U.S. are complex, with states holding much of the authority.",
      "Still, experts say that Kennedy could wield enormous influence over childhood vaccinations.",
      "If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy would oversee a suite of health agencies that includes the CDC, the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, among others.",
      "His greatest influence on vaccines, experts say, could come through the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent group of health experts that helps the agency make recommendations for states and insurers on what vaccines to cover, including childhood vaccinations.",
      "The committee reports to the CDC director. The CDC director then informs the HHS secretary of the immunization recommendations. Last month, Trump tapped Dr. Dave Weldon, a former congressman from Florida and a physician who has made false claims about vaccines, to lead the CDC.",
      "According to KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, the HHS secretary has the authority to appoint new members to the committee, and advisory committee members can be replaced at the discretion of the secretary.",
      "There are currently 15 voting members of ACIP, but the committee can have up to 19. Committee members generally serve four-year terms, and several members\u2019 terms are set to end in 2025, according to a committee roster. However, many will remain in place until 2028, unless Kennedy directs them to resign.",
      "Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy researcher at the University of California Law San Francisco, said she sees two potential scenarios: Kennedy could replace members of ACIP with anti-vaccine advocates who make recommendations that the CDC approves, or he could influence Weldon, as the CDC director, to reject ACIP recommendations. The CDC director is not required to sign off on the committee\u2019s recommendations, but usually does.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases and a nonvoting member of ACIP, said that even if there\u2019s a shake-up at ACIP \u2014 and the CDC makes new recommendations against certain vaccines \u2014 parents may still choose to vaccinate their children. States are not required to follow the recommendations, but most do.",
      "\u201cAlthough this stuff can and will have an impact, most parents, I think, are still going to listen to the recommendation of their child\u2019s pediatrician,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about childhood vaccines, parents want to do what\u2019s best for their kids, and politics aside, that matters a lot more.\u201d",
      "Reiss noted, however, that ACIP\u2019s recommendations have direct implications for insurance and which vaccines are covered.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to cover vaccines that ACIP recommends.",
      "\u201cFor example, if the committee requests against giving children DTaP, or recommends against giving them at the ages they are now, those won\u2019t be covered by insurance,\u201d she said, referring to the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). Insurers could decide to cover them anyway, she added, but that\u2019ll be up to them.",
      "Federal funds",
      "Experts also expressed concerns about Kenndy\u2019s influence over the allocation of federal funds.",
      "The Section 317 program, for example, is a grant managed by the CDC that provides funding to states and local health agencies to deliver vaccines. Public health departments apply for grants through the CDC.",
      "\u201cHe could make vaccines more difficult to get paid for,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cHe could make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit and other experts also said they\u2019re concerned about Kennedy\u2019s influence over new vaccine approvals and whether he could slow the approval process down.",
      "He could also direct new research into existing vaccines, such as the polio shot, creating the appearance of potential issues with the vaccines and fostering public distrust, experts say.",
      "Trump picked Dr. Marty Makary, a pancreatic surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, to lead the FDA. It\u2019s unclear how Makary would operate in the position, but he has recently made comments defending Kennedy. A Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offit, also a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, said he\u2019s concerned that Kennedy could continue to spread misinformation about vaccines, which could cause parents to rethink vaccinating their children.",
      "\u201cIf you look at polls now, there\u2019s clearly been an erosion in trust in vaccines and vaccine safety,\u201d he said. \u201cNow he\u2019ll have a bigger platform. He\u2019s the head of the most important public health agency,\u201d he said, referring to Kennedy."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In what would be a political makeover for the ages, Donald Trump says that moments after he takes the oath of office next month, he\u2019ll cast himself as something notably off-brand: a unifier.",
      "The theme of his inaugural address? \"Unity,\" he told Kristen Welker, moderator of NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cIt will make you happy: unity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a message of unity.\u201d",
      "What that means in practice is, for now, anyone's guess. Trump rose to power in 2016 by dint of a divided electorate. He lost the White House four years later and won it back last month by delivering much the same hard-line message in much the same blunt terms.",
      "At 78, Trump isn\u2019t about to reinvent himself, nor has he given any sign that he\u2019s rethinking the polarizing positions he has taken on mass deportations or pardoning those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress counted the electoral votes certifying Joe Biden's victory.",
      "He remains plainly and vocally bitter about how he says he has been wronged by judges, prosecutors, Democratic officials and the news media. In the interview in which he called for unity, he singled out House members who investigated the Jan. 6 attack and said they should be jailed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in a happy, clappy time,\u201d Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser in Trump\u2019s first term, said in an interview. \u201cKamala Harris\u2019 \u2018politics of joy\u2019 failed. Why? Because the lived experience of Americans is not joyous right now. That\u2019s why Trump won in landslide.\u201d",
      "Still, some Trump advisers say he\u2019s sincere about wanting to bridge the political chasm. They said he's uniquely positioned to do so now that he has waged his last campaign and hopes to cement a favorable place in history.",
      "Something unexpected happened in the election on Nov. 5. Voting blocs that had previously shunned Trump gave him a fresh look. He racked up gains among Hispanic and Black voters in key states who are normally part of the Democratic coalition as he won the popular vote for the first time in his three tries.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey conducted after the election found that most Americans approved of Trump\u2019s plans for the future. While a majority doubted that Trump could broker a detente between red and blue America, a larger share had warmer feelings about him than was the case at the ends of the 2016 and 2020 elections.",
      "\u201cHaving essentially vanquished the Democratic Party in Congress and [won the] popular vote and the electoral vote, I think he sees that there\u2019s a major opportunity here for bipartisanship and breakthroughs,\u201d said Dick Morris, an informal political adviser to Trump over the years and once a campaign adviser to Bill Clinton. \u201cAnd I think he feels that people are exhausted from conflict on both sides and there\u2019s a real chance here for him to open up a new front.\u201d",
      "John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, said it would be a mistake to dismiss his call for a national rapprochement out of hand.",
      "\u201cAs a businessman, Trump is not a typical politician,\u201d McLaughlin said in an interview. \u201cWhen he tells you something, he\u2019s being very direct, and you should take him at his word.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to try to unify the country,\u201d McLaughlin continued. \u201cTrump is going to only have one term. There will be opposition to him. But he\u2019d like to have a historic presidency and accomplish more for the country.\u201d",
      "Binding up a fractured nation is a goal that recent presidents have shared and none have reached. Americans have been in a bad mood: anxious about the future and unhappy with political leadership, polling shows. One of the few patches of common ground is a collective belief that the nation\u2019s political system is broken, surveys show.",
      "Biden mentioned \u201cunity\u201d nearly a dozen times in his inaugural speech in 2021, yet two-thirds of Americans now believe that the country has gotten more polarized since he took office, a Monmouth University poll found.",
      "For Trump, a starting point might be spelling out what he means when he says he wants to narrow the political rift.",
      "In his mind, does that mean his rivals should stifle their policy objections and line up behind his agenda? Or does it mean that he\u2019ll compromise with Democratic lawmakers and end the attacks on those who defy him?",
      "\u201cNo one has ever gotten rich betting on Donald Trump to do the right thing, because he never does,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a Trump transition spokeswoman, said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump will serve ALL Americans, even those who did not vote for him in the election. He will unify the country through success.\u201d",
      "With millions watching live, the inauguration would be the obvious forum for Trump to commit himself to healing, rather than stoke national divisions.",
      "Every president hopes at least some part of his inaugural address will prove memorable. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s two speeches bookending the Civil War reached poetic heights. Ronald Reagan\u2019s address in 1981 set a tone for the new administration: \u201cIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s first inaugural address was remembered mostly for the term \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d After he finished, a mystified former President George W. Bush remarked, \u201cThat was some weird s---.\u201d",
      "Bannon recommended that Trump try something new this time \u2014 a gesture that could unite right, left and center given the intense dissatisfaction with the lawmakers who will be sitting on risers directly behind him.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I would recommend to President Trump is if he wants to unify the country is that halfway through the speech, pivot the podium around, face the Washington, D.C., political class sitting in the risers and read them the riot act,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cTell them things are going to change, that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town. Then, turn back around and finish the speech facing the American people. That will unite the country.\u201d",
      "Oftentimes, the high-minded prose in an inaugural speech is quickly forgotten in the pell-mell rush to get the new presidency off the ground.",
      "The ultimate test will be not so much the words Trump speaks from the teleprompter but the actions he takes over the next four years, analysts said.",
      "Ted Widmer, a speechwriter in Clinton\u2019s White House and now a history professor at City University of New York, said in an interview: \u201cIf \u2018unity\u2019 were followed up by actual policies that promote unity \u2014 like bringing Democrats into his Cabinet and working with Democrats in Congress on legislation that meets the needs and desires of a lot of different kinds of Americans \u2014 that would be great. But nobody expects that. It\u2019s slash-and-burn already, and he\u2019s not even president yet. He just nominates extremists to his Cabinet.\u201d"

      "Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody on Wednesday announced the state has obtained an arrest warrant for attempted felony murder against Ryan Routh, who is already being held in federal custody on charges of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump.",
      "It\u2019s a continuation of a back-and-forth between the Biden administration and Florida Republican leaders over the state\u2019s role in investigating the September assassination attempt, which was the second attempt on Trump's life in three months. Routh\u2019s trial date is set for February.",
      "Routh is facing five federal charges, including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate, but Florida officials have said the federal government has \u201cstonewalled\u201d the state\u2019s ability to conduct their own investigation or partner with the federal investigation.",
      "\u201cThe feds have stonewalled Florida\u2019s investigation of the Trump assassination attempt at every turn, and I appreciate AG Moody and her team for plowing forward despite some resistance,\u201d DeSantis posted on X after Moody made her announcement during a morning press conference.",
      "Trump has been critical of the Department of Justice\u2019s handling of the second assassination attempt. The Justice Department did not answer a request for comment.",
      "Moody said the arrest warrant for attempted felony murder is not directly related to the Trump assassination attempt itself but because of a vehicle crash that happened as the result of police shutting down traffic on a highway as they attempted to catch a fleeing Routh.",
      "Moody says that backed-up traffic as the result of the search caused a vehicle accident that injured a six-year-old girl, which motivated the state\u2019s push to seek its own charges. The crash happened three or four miles south of where Routh was apprehended, according to an affidavit released by Moody\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cWhen you couple those terrible injuries together with his other criminal conduct, which we believe rises to the level of domestic terrorism, it turns his actions into an attempted felony murder,\u201d Moody said at the press conference.",
      "The threat against Trump's life while he was playing golf at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach immediately drew attention from Florida Republican leaders after the Sept. 15 incident.",
      "Two days later, DeSantis issued an executive order directing state law enforcement to investigate the attempted assassination, and a month later, Moody sued the FBI over what she called at the time an \u201cunlawful attempt to block Florida\u2019s criminal investigation.\u201d",
      "During her press conference Wednesday, which DeSantis could not attend due to inclement weather, much of Moody\u2019s comments focused on a \u201cnew day\u201d that Trump\u2019s law enforcement appointments will bring to the federal government.",
      "She specifically mentioned Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, who previously held the same post in Florida, and FBI director pick Kash Patel.",
      "\u201cA new day is coming,\u201d Moody said. \u201cThe people who have been nominated, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, love this country and what it is meant to be.\u201d",
      "Moody, who is among the contenders on a shortlist to fill the Senate seat being vacated by secretary of state pick Marco Rubio, reiterated her support for Trump\u2019s nomination of both Patel and Bondi.",
      "\u201cI expect next month we will see new leadership at agencies that will rightly reach out as intended,\u201d she said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up a long-running dispute in South Carolina over the state\u2019s attempt to prevent the health care provider Planned Parenthood from participating in the Medicaid health program.",
      "The technical legal issue is whether people eligible to use Medicaid, a program for low-income people administered by states, can sue in order to pick the qualified health care provider of their choice.",
      "Republican-led South Carolina has long sought to bar Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid because it provides abortions. The legal landscape in the state has changed since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. South Carolina now bans all abortions after six weeks \u2014 a threshold that makes the procedure increasingly rare.",
      "Planned Parenthood has facilities in Charleston and Columbia that now provide limited abortion care in line with the new ban as well as other health care services including contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "Julie Edwards, a patient who wanted to use Planned Parenthood to obtain contraception services, joined the group in suing the state following a decision in 2018 that found abortion clinics could not provide family planning services under Medicaid.",
      "The case has bounced around the courts since a district court judge ruled that the state could not bar Planned Parenthood from participating in the program.",
      "State officials are represented in the case by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\"Pro-life states like South Carolina should be free to determine that Planned Parenthood and other entities that peddle abortion are not qualified to receive taxpayer funding through Medicaid,\" one of the group's lawyers, John Bursch, said in a statement."

      "MOSCOW \u2014 A man has been arrested in connection with the assassination of the head of\u00a0Russia's chemical, radiological and biological weapons unit, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, authorities in the country said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cDuring the interrogation, he explained that he was recruited by the Ukrainian special services,\u201d Svetlana Petrenko, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOn their instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received a homemade explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance to the residential building where Igor Kirillov lived,\u201d she added.",
      "Tuesday's assassination marks the latest in a long line of acts of sabotage and covert killings to hit Russia as its war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "At the site of the explosion on Wednesday bent metal and bricks blown from the walls could be seen and blood in the snow all remained at the scene. As people and cars passed by on the busy street where Kirillov lived, some left red roses.",
      "The suspect rented a car and \u201cinstalled a video surveillance camera,\u201d so he could broadcast the footage online, Petrenko said, adding that he was from Uzbekistan and in his twenties.",
      "The suspect, who authorities did not name, was identified by state media citing footage from the FSB \u2014 Russia's domestic intelligence agency \u2014 as Akhmad Kurbanov.",
      "Petrenko said he was was guaranteed $100,000 and European residence as payment for the attack, which also killed Kirillov's assistant Ilya Polikarpov.",
      "The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had already claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday, although national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan told MSNBC that the U.S. was not aware of the operation ahead of time and was not involved.",
      "\"We do support and enable Ukraine to defend itself and to take the fight to Russian forces on the battlefield. But not operations like this,\" Sullivan said.",
      "Video published on Telegram by Russia's Investigative Committee\u00a0on Tuesday showed emergency responders parked outside an apartment building where one entrance could be seen visibly damaged.",
      "Kirillov was killed the day after he was charged by Ukrainian security services with the use of banned chemical weapons during Russia\u2019s\u00a0invasion\u00a0of the country, which in February 2022. Russian authorities have denied those allegations.",
      "His death is the latest in a string of such attacks and the most recent move in the shadow war underlying the front-line conflict Russia and Ukraine have been fighting for almost three years.",
      "Last month, the SBU claimed they had assassinated Valery Trankovsky, a Russian naval captain in charge of a brigade missile ships in the Black Sea, after his car was blown up.",
      "Citing Ukrainian media, the Associated Press also reported that Sergei Yevsyukov \u2014 the former head of a prison housing Ukrainian POWs \u2014 was killed by a car bomb in Russian-occupied Donetsk earlier this month.",
      "For its part, Russia was accused of sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard aircraft bound for North America.",
      "While the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, its first land grab came in 2014. It was then when Washington and Kyiv began developing intelligence cooperation, with the U.S. espionage community training the Ukrainian military intelligence agency known as the GUR that has been at the forefront of the country's sabotage offensive, former U.S. officials told NBC News last year.",
      "Amid the grinding attrition the huge Russian army has used to eke out territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, sabotage and assassinations have been two of the unconventional methods Ukraine has deployed to score morale-boosting wins and avoid burning through its limited troops and materiel.",
      "Kirillov had also been sanctioned by Britain in October, with U.K. authorities punishing the general and Russia's nuclear protection forces for the use of riot control agents and reports of the use of chloropicrin, a chemical choking agent, on the battlefield.",
      "In a statement at the time, the British government said Kirillov was \u201cresponsible for helping deploy these barbaric weapons\u201d and had also been \u201ca significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation, spreading lies to mask Russia\u2019s shameful and dangerous behavior.\u201d",
      "But shortly after his death, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson\u00a0Maria Zakharova defended\u00a0Kirillov, who also held several posts in the Directorate of the Chief of Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense since 2009 before leading the force, according to state news agency, RIA.",
      "\u201cHe worked fearlessly,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova said in a statement published to Telegram.\u00a0\u201cHe met problems head on. For the Motherland, for the truth. Bright be his memory, may he rest in peace.\u201d",
      "She added that he had been \u201csystematically exposing the crimes of the Anglo-Saxons for many years.\u201d",
      "The killings have come during a period in which Russian forces have gained momentum in the country\u2019s war with Ukraine, pushing forward in the east of the country.",
      "However, Ukrainian special forces said Tuesday they had killed 50 North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, marking the first such casualties since the secretive communist state sent soldiers to eastern Europe.",
      "Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said Monday that North Korean military personnel have been killed and wounded in combat operations in the area but did not specify how many casualties they had suffered.",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Moscow and David Hodari reported from London."

    "summary": "A report from Senate Democrats says a key national security office remains critically underfunded, resulting in U.S-made technology continuing to fall into Russian hands as it conducts its illegal war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S.-made technology continues to fall into Russian hands in Ukraine as a key national security office remains critically underfunded, according to a report from Senate Democrats released Wednesday.",
      "The report, spearheaded by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., comes just as officials in the incoming Trump administration call for massive cuts to government spending. While their arguments have focused on cutting government waste, the new report highlights how existing capacity shortfalls in key government agencies are already undermining U.S. interests.",
      "In the 30-page report, Democratic staff on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations say the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\u2019s enforcement of export controls \u201cis a shadow of what it should be, and inadequate at every level.\u201d",
      "The agency, it said, is asked to fulfill a key national security function \u201con a shoestring budget\u201d using \u201claughable technology that has not been meaningfully updated for nearly two decades\u201d despite more modern alternatives in use not only in the private sector but also at other government agencies.",
      "The end result: U.S. microchips and other equipment continue to be found in Russian missiles, armored vehicles and drones.",
      "The report is the result of a 15-month probe led by Blumenthal in which the leaders of the largest U.S. semiconductor producers testified before the panel and were grilled by both Republicans and Democrats over Russia\u2019s ability to acquire and use their products despite export limitations.",
      "An earlier version of the report was released ahead of the hearing in September, finding that export controls at the U.S.\u2019s four major chipmakers \u2014 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Analog Devices, Intel and Texas Instruments Inc. \u2014 have been \u201cabjectly lacking.\u201d",
      "The new report shows part of the issue may be lack of federal enforcement. The BIS \u201chas largely left the decision of how to comply with the law to semiconductor companies themselves,\u201d the report finds. It also accuses the agency of failing to charge the companies with sufficiently serious violations or imposed fines.",
      "A Department of Commerce spokesperson told NBC News that under the Biden administration, \u201cBIS has implemented the most robust export controls in history, and crucially, we\u2019ve done so in concert with our allies to deny Russia the items it needs to maintain its war machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile BIS\u2019 budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that with the necessary resources from Congress, as Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and bipartisan members of Congress have called for, \"the agency will be even better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency under his second administration, billionaire Howard Lutnick, at times encouraged calls to slash funding to federal agencies and even empowered Elon Musk to take the helm of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has called for cuts of as much as $2 trillion in federal spending \u2014 more than the entire discretionary budget.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the companies named in the report but has so far only heard back from Texas Instruments and AMD.",
      "\u201cTexas Instruments (TI) strongly opposes the use of our chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia. TI stopped selling products into Russia and Belarus in February 2022. Any shipments of TI chips into Russia are illicit and unauthorized,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe devote significant time and resources to developing, implementing and refining policies and procedures to combat illicit diversion and keep chips out of the hands of bad actors. If we find evidence indicating product diversion, we investigate and take action.\u201d",
      "An AMD spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cAMD shares the goal of preventing Russian military access to our products outlined in the Senate PSI report and has no tolerance for their illicit diversion into Russian weapon systems. We ceased all sales and tech support for our products to Russia and all restricted regions immediately following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Our export compliance program is developed with guidance from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security. Before we make a sale, we undertake measures to ensure we know who we are selling to, including a refusal to do business with any company that may have a direct or indirect association with a sanctioned entity. AMD is continuing our collaborations with BIS and the Disruptive Technology Strike Force on this challenging but critical issue.\u201d",
      "Although the U.S. and its Western allies have imposed an array of sanctions to cripple Russia\u2019s economy and cut off the Kremlin\u2019s access to key parts used to build weapons, Russia\u2019s production of artillery, missiles and drones has dramatically increased, according to a report from over the summer. The report from the Royal United Services Institute, a U.K.-based defense think tank, found that Russia obtains raw materials and weapons components from NATO member countries, and greater collaboration is needed between the nations to choke Moscow\u2019s access.",
      "Export controls have emerged as a critical national security tool over the last two decades. Democrats on the investigative panel said the efforts are not only central to crippling Russia\u2019s advances in Ukraine, but also to slowing China\u2019s progress to match the U.S. in artificial intelligence.",
      "In a letter to Raimondo on Wednesday, Blumenthal outlined the report\u2019s findings and asked the agency to take \u201caggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine.\u201d",
      "He referred to a Bloomberg News article from earlier this month that reported Western officials have been continuously frustrated to find Russian weapons \u201cchock full\u201d of American-made electronic components despite a flurry of trade controls. In fact, the report found that, in some cases, Russian distributors have simply integrated ordering information from Texas Instruments\u2019 online shop, TI store, into their offerings, allowing them to see and order up-to-date parts with the click of a mouse. The items then get routed through Hong Kong or other countries before arriving in Russia.",
      "TI told Bloomberg it devotes significant time and resources to keep its products out of Russian hands. In September, a TI official told a Senate hearing about the efforts it makes to control exports to its products.",
      "\u201cI want to be very clear: TI strongly opposes the use of our chips in Russian military equipment. Any shipments of TI products into Russia are illicit and unauthorized,\u201d Shannon Thompson, the company\u2019s assistant general counsel, said during the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings in September. \u201cWe work hard to prevent the illicit diversion of our parts into Russia.

      "Mack Davis, 22, pleaded guilty to one count of committing a hate crime by attempting to carry out the mass killings in Owosso, about 25 miles west of Flint. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, according to a news release from the Department of Justice.",
      "\u201cThis kind of vile and heinous hate-fueled violence, intended to target innocent people based on their sexual orientation, runs contrary to our values as Americans,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement included in the release. \u201cBias-motivated crimes targeting the LGBTQI+ community will not be tolerated.\u00a0 The Justice Department will continue using every tool at our disposal to protect communities from the scourge of hate-fueled violence by prosecuting those who carry out or attempt to carry out such crimes.\u201d",
      "Officials said Davis researched and wrote about dozens of mass killers in journals, on other items in his home and on social media between July of last year and June, when he was arrested on an unrelated charge. In those 11 months, Davis drafted a list of weapons he owned and weapons he intended to acquire to carry out his own mass killing, officials said. By June, he had amassed an arsenal that included two firearms, magazines, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a crossbow and arrows, assorted bomb-making parts, smoke grenades, tactical gear and several knives, officials said. One of his knives was inscribed with an anti-gay slur, \u201cF----- Killer,\u201d officials said.",
      "Between April and June, Davis posted on social media about opening fire on a local political party\u2019s headquarters, which he said, using an anti-gay slur, was \u201cfilled with far-left liberal, f----- scum,\u201d and a nearby bar that Davis had referred to as a \u201cf----- bar,\u201d according to the DOJ release. Officials did not specify which political party the headquarters belonged to or whether the nearby bar is a gay bar.",
      "In June, Davis also spray-painted the word \u201cfag\u201d on the car of one of his neighbors, whom officials said Davis knew to be gay, and vandalized another car. Days later, Davis test-fired one of his firearms by shooting approximately 60 bullets at several of his neighbors\u2019 properties, including one of the cars he had previously vandalized, officials said.",
      "Police arrested him after the shooting incident and he has remained in custody since June. He will be sentenced for planning the foiled attack at a later, unspecified date, according to the release.",
      "\u201cDavis\u2019 plans were chilling. He intended to commit mass shootings at two locations \u2014 destroying countless lives and devastating our community \u2014 all because of his fanatical hatred for gay people,\u201d Dawn N. Ison, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a statement. \u201cI applaud the work of law enforcement in disrupting this awful plot and arresting Davis before he could carry out his planned attacks.\u201d",
      "Davis\u2019 attorney, Bryan Sherer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "In 2020, a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Club Q, was similarly attacked, leaving five people dead and injuring 17 others. The 24-year-old shooter pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to life in prison.

    "summary": "Are Zaina and J.R. still together now? She reveals what happened during and after the proposal in 'The Ultimatum' Season 3 and if they are still speaking.",
    "story": [
      "Zaina Sesay says she was \"completely blindsided\" by the finale of \"The Ultimatum\" Season 3.",
      "The finale, released Dec. 18, was the culmination of a few charged weeks in her relationship with Jon Richard \"J.R.\" Warren.",
      "Zaina, 32, and J.R., 33, were together for three years before going on the show. She issued the ultimatum to him, and in the finale she got her answer. But watching the show has been a bigger revelation, she says.",
      "\"I was completely blindsided by everything,\" Zaina tells TODAY.com in an interview. \"I had no idea who the person that I saw watching it was. I did not recognize J.R. My friends and family are like, 'Who is that man? We don\u2019t know him.' And I just feel like I was completely deceived the entire time, to the point where now the world feels like we were in a fake relationship based off of how he was acting.\"",
      "Read on to find out how Zaina and J.R.'s journey on the show ended and where they stand today.",
      "Do Zaina and J.R. get engaged in the 'Ultimatum' finale?",
      "Zaina and J.R. had trial marriages with Scotty Lewis and Sandy Gallagher, respectively. At first, in the finale, it seemed like the experience caused J.R. to change his mind about marriage.",
      "\"You showed me so much love and care. I want to thank you for that,\" J.R. told Zaina in the finale. \"I wasn't ready to receive it before this.\"",
      "Taking her hands, he told her he thought she'd make a \"fantastic wife and mother,\" and that he envisioned himself giving \"100%\" to make her happy.",
      "\"I can see all that with you,\" he said.",
      "But \u2014 with a revelation timed to the music stopping \u2014 J.R. decided he wasn't at that point to give her what she deserved. He wasn\u2019t the \"rock\" or the \"provider\" he wanted to be. So, he decided to leave the show single.",
      "Zaina seemed at peace with his choice and told J.R. he would be an amazing husband one day. \"Deep down, I just knew you weren't ready,\" she said.",
      "The two both became emotional as Zaina told J.R. she loved him and they shared a kiss. He reciprocated the sentiment. \"You're still my favorite person,\" Zaina said.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about that day, Zaina says she wasn't sure whether J.R. would propose.",
      "\"It was just so hard to tell because the entire trial marriage he kept  saying all the right things to keep me holding on to hope,\" she says. \"I felt like there was a possibility we would have left there together, or at least not gotten engaged and then continued our relationship off in real life.\"",
      "But on \"Ultimatum Day\" she noticed that his body language gave away his decision.",
      "\"He kept backing up. I was like 'Are you trying to actually go into the bushes like Homer Simpson? I\u2019m confused,'\" she says.",
      "What is Zaina and J.R.'s relationship like now?",
      "As far as her current relationship with J.R. goes, Zaina tells TODAY.com that it is \"non-existent.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s unfortunate, because I am a very understanding person. I like to have conversations, and I feel like if he would have taken accountability in any way, shape or form, we could have been cordial. But he avoided any real conversation,\" she says.",
      "The reality television star continues, \"So it\u2019s like almost passing a stranger on the street. We run into each other at events and I don\u2019t even look his way, because everything that happened was so disrespectful to the 10th degree.\"",
      "Zaina says she's happy that \"everything came to light\" and she is at peace with the end of her relationship.",
      "\"It sucks that I had to go through that experience, but I feel like sometimes God has a way of revealing things. And it was clear: J.R. and I were not meant to be together and he needed to be removed,\" she says.",
      "The real shock, Zaina adds, has come in watching J.R.'s relationship with Sandy, his trial marriage partner. On camera, J.R. and Sandy were open about developing feelings for each other and shared two kisses. This, however, was news to Zaina.",
      "\"When we switched back over, J.R. was very much so, like, \u2018Nothing happened. Sandy was the one that initiated everything.\u2019 He was saying all these things to downplay everything to the point where I believed him, and I was just like, 'There\u2019s nothing for me to worry about,'\" she says.",
      "While Sandy had spoken to Zaina about the trial marriage, she says she didn\u2019t know the extent of their relationship until recently.",
      "\"After the show he never gave me closure, or he refused to have real conversations. I didn\u2019t know anything that happened between him and Sandy until last month, before we shot the reunion,\" she says.",
      "Since the show, Zaina has been supported by family, who are \"very upset\" on her behalf.",
      "\"They\u2019re thanking God I\u2019m out of that toxic situation. They\u2019re just pouring a lot of love into me, but also like, \u2018Please, just stay away from him,'\" she says.",
      "At the reunion, which aired Dec. 18, J.R. told his side of the story, saying that Zaina was upset about the time they spent broken up after the show and did not want J.R. to date other people.",
      "\u201cI told her I needed time to process things, and she wanted to go back to what we were doing, and ignore the whole experience, and get back together,\u201d J.R. said. \u201cWe\u2019re not together. I feel like if we really want to realize what we want out of our relationship, we do need to take this time apart. I think you were upset about that.\u201d",
      "Zaina clarified that after their breakup, they lived across the street from each other while continuing to talk and spend time together.",
      "\u201cNaturally, I was really confused and he refused to give me any type of closure,\u201d Zaina said. \u201cI would ask, \u2018OK, during this break, are we seeing other people?\u2019 That\u2019s a valid question to ask. That was asking for clarity. That is not being controlling.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a lot of love for Zaina. I don\u2019t know where all this hostility is coming from. I\u2019ve helped her whenever she called on me. There\u2019s no time where I shut her out,\u201d J.R. responded. \u201cI haven\u2019t given her closure because I\u2019m still processing things.\u201d",
      "Where is Zaina now?",
      "Zaina says she has \"no regrets\" about going on the show and would do it \"a million times over\" because before she was \"blinded to everything.\"",
      "\"I'm just really grateful for the entire experience, no matter how painful it was and how many tears I shed, and how awful the healing journey was,\" she says.",
      "After the show she went on a \"deep healing journey.\"",
      "\"I just started prioritizing myself. I started really leaning into my passions. I left my corporate job to pursue becoming an entrepreneur on my own.  I\u2019m working on building my own wellness brand. Fitness, wellness (and) self care are the three things that I want to prioritize (as well as) mental health,\" she says.",
      "Zaina added that she is also looking forward to sharing her story with others \"to help them identify when it\u2019s time to walk away.\""

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 18:39:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Is The Sticky based on a true story? Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist true story and how it inspired the TV show.",
    "story": [
      "In July 2012, Michel Gavreau was conducting a routine inspection of a maple syrup warehouse near Laurierville, Quebec.",
      "He climbed up a stack of 600-pound barrels, expecting them to support his weight, but when he reached the top, he almost fell.",
      "One of the barrels seemed unbalanced and when Gavreau peered inside, he realized it was empty. As it turned out, many of the surrounding drums were empty, too, and others had been filled with water, according to Vanity Fair's 2016 reporting, which quoted spokeswoman for the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers\u00a0Federation Caroline Cyr's retelling of the story.",
      "This marked the discovery of what came to be known as the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist, a multi-year operation in which a ring of thieves siphoned syrup from thousands of barrels worth millions of dollars.",
      "The heist inspired a new Prime Video series, \u201cThe Sticky\u201d (Dec. 6), starring Margo Martindale as a syrup farmer about to have her land seized by the government.",
      "The comedy-drama is only loosely based on the actual heist and in fact, none of the show\u2019s protagonists are based on the real syrup thieves.",
      "While \u201cThe Sticky\u201d is \u201cabsolutely not the true story\u201d of the heist, as the show\u2019s trailer notes, the series does call fresh attention to one of the most unusual crimes in Canadian history.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story of the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist.",
      "Why would people steal maple syrup?",
      "Maple syrup may seem like an odd target for a multimillion dollar heist, but the sweet commodity is big business in Canada.",
      "Canada produces nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s pure maple syrup, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "Syrup harvests vary every year due to climate, tree disease and other factors. To meet the world\u2019s demand for maple syrup, producers created a strategic reserve, where they can stockpile extra syrup in good years and draw from the surplus in bad years.",
      "\u201cIn the States you have the strategic oil reserve,\u201d Simon Tr\u00e9panier, then general manager of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, now executive director, told The New York Times in 2012. \u201cMother Nature is not generous every year, so we have our own global strategic reserve.\u201d",
      "The strategic reserve allows producers to keep prices stable \u2014 and the prices are not insignificant.",
      "Around the time of the heist, maple syrup was trading for $32 per gallon, or $1,800 per barrel, according to Bloomberg News. (By comparison, a gallon of crude oil in 2012 cost $2.66, according to Statista.)",
      "Throughout the months-long heist, thieves stole syrup from more than 9,500 barrels, with a market value of more than $18 million CAD, or about $12 million USD in 2024.",
      "At his trial, heist ringleader Richard Valli\u00e8res said he sold the stolen syrup for $10 million CAD, making a personal profit of around $1 million CAD, or just over $700,000 USD today, according to BBC News.",
      "\u201cTo steal that amount of maple syrup means you have to know the market,\u201d Tr\u00e9panier told Bloomberg.",
      "How did the thieves pull it off?",
      "In 2011, there was an especially large surplus of maple syrup, meaning that producers had to rent an additional warehouse to stockpile the additional supply.",
      "Here, thieves saw an opportunity. They rented out another section of that extra warehouse under the guise of using it for a different business, which gave them access to the building, according to The New York Times.",
      "Sometimes, the thieves would truck out drums of syrup from the warehouse by night and siphon them into their own barrels, then return the original barrels filled with water, according to Vanity Fair.",
      "Later, the criminals found a way to drain syrup directly from the barrels in the warehouse, without having to cart them away and secretly return them. The syrup would then be trafficked to buyers outside Quebec who allegedly did not realize it had been stolen.",
      "Incredibly, after the theft was discovered, more than 600 barrels of the stolen syrup were recovered in New Brunswick in October 2012, and was transported back to Quebec under police protection, NBC News reported.",
      "At the time, \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, the owner of the New Brunswick export company where the syrup was found, said he had no idea that syrup had been stolen, telling police it had been sold to him by his usual suppliers in Quebec, according to NBC News.",
      "However, it later emerged that St-Pierre was in on the scheme. He was found guilty in 2016 of fraud and trafficking stolen goods, per the CBC.",
      "What happened to the criminals?",
      "Twenty-six people were arrested in 2016 in connection with the maple syrup theft, according to the CBC.",
      "A year later, in 2017, the heist\u2019s ringleader, Richard Valli\u00e8res, was sentenced to nearly eight years in prison and fined more than $9 million CAD, Reuters reported.",
      "He appealed this ruling and had his fine reduced to about $1 million CAD. However, in 2022, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court reversed this appeal, ruling that he should pay the full amount of the value of the syrup he stole, according to BBC News.",
      "Valli\u00e8res\u2019 father, Raymond Valli\u00e8res, was also in on the scheme, according to Canada\u2019s Global News. He was sentenced to two years minus one day in jail and was required to pay about $10,000 CAD within one year.",
      "Others sentenced for their involvement include syrup reseller \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, Avik Caron, whose wife partly owned the warehouse at the center of the heist, and S\u00e9bastien Jutras, a trucker who transported stolen syrup.",
      "Jutras testified at trial that he occasionally collected money from buyers for Richard Valli\u00e8res, saying he once picked up a shoebox full of money that \u201chad to be $200,000,\u201d Canada\u2019s National Post reported in 2017.",
      "He also shared how Valli\u00e8res allegedly justified stealing large quantities of syrup from the FPAQ.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Stealing from thieves is not stealing,\u2019\u201d Jutras testified."

      "Gonzalez may still be in the middle of making her house a home, but she says she's never felt more at home within herself.",
      "\u201cThis moment in my life feels like the beginning of being awake,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot that happened in my life that I was always trying to numb myself to, and for the first time ... I can face whatever it is that comes my way.\u201d",
      "That includes starring in the late Jenni Rivera biopic \u201cJenni,\u201d in theaters and available on the Spanish-language streaming service Vix now. \u201cJenni\u201d tells the tragic and intense real-life story of the late Mexican American regional singer from Long Beach, California, who became one of the leading ladies in a predominantly male-fronted genre.",
      "From her teen pregnancy, musical family upbringing and abusive marriages \u2014 all before her untimely death at 43 in a plane crash \u2014 Rivera was a take-no-BS woman. And she was one who was admired, scrutinized and beloved by many.",
      "Which is why, when offered to audition for the role, Gonzalez says she was \u201cscared s---less.\u201d The team behind the film reached out three times in the span of two months, and Gonzalez kept passing on the opportunity.",
      "\u201cI turned it down because I was like, \u2018Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t know much about her. How am I going to do this?\u2019 Speaking Spanish, the type of music that she does ... that\u2019s not something that I\u2019m familiar with. Culturally, yes, it\u2019s in my ethos, but it\u2019s not something that I grew up around or listening to.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez's team and close friends kept insisting she give the role a shot, including her \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d co-star Jesse Garcia, who \u201creally convinced me to audition.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce I read (for the role), I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to book it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s just certain things that click. I think what we do as creatives, as artists, is such a spiritual thing. A lot of times things come to us to break us free, open us up to pieces of ourselves that we never knew, that we didn\u2019t know we could access, or that we needed to.\u201d",
      "The result is a heart-wrenching look at the reality of a young woman who had to physically and emotionally fight back to reclaim her joy, protect her children and make a name for herself. Rivera, who was a mother of five, died Dec. 9, 2012 in a fatal plane crash in Monterrey, Mexico. The accident also claimed the lives of six others.",
      "GONZALEZ ALWAYS knew she wanted to be an actor. Raised by single mother Anna Castillo in Los Angeles and a slew of t\u00edas, Gonzalez \u2014\u00a0who is sixth generation Mexican American \u2014 was surrounded by creatives. Her mom, who also had acting aspirations, had her when she was 23.",
      "\u201cShe was like my big sister,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe were little creative babies, and would walk around the house and listen to music and do accents. My babysitters a lot of the time were Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers from watching old movies. It was a lot of daydreaming.\u201d",
      "Her father, Gabriel Gonzalez, is also an actor and musician.",

Soria), one of three Mexican American cousins the show follows in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. The show ran for two seasons, and it was there that she connected and became close friends with co-creator Linda Yvette Ch\u00e1vez. The two later worked together on Eva Longoria\u2019s directorial debut \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot,\u201d written by Ch\u00e1vez and co-starring Gonzalez.",
      "\u201cEva taught me very early on to not get attached to any high or to not get attached to any low. She taught me that whatever you want, you\u2019re going to have to be the one that decides and goes after it,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cIf you want it to happen overnight, you won\u2019t have longevity. If you love the art, focus on that. That should be the most important thing, the art and the joy of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cEva really taught me relevance comes and goes,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about believing that you\u2019re relevant in here: inside of your heart, finding that peace in here.\u201d",

      "As a journalist in Los Angeles, my path has crossed with Gonzalez's many times over the last years. From a set visit during the first season of \u201cGentefied\u201d to interviewing her for \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d and running into each other at events in Hollywood, Gonzalez's genuine spirit has has always shined through.",

      "Gonzalez has also given herself grace to rise and fall \u2014 much like Rivera did over the course of her complicated life.",
      "\u201cThis was one of the hardest projects I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThis helped me open up to myself. Now, even watching \u2018Jenni,\u2019 I see certain things. Because I\u2019ve grown so much as a person in the last two years since shooting the film, that I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh s---, I wonder how I would approach this now.\u2019 There\u2019s always room to grow, and I\u2019m proud of myself.\u201d",

      "\u201cI asked a lot of questions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was only one lunch, so you can only get so much, and ultimately, for me, it was about getting her essence. I\u2019d be doing a disservice to her if I was trying to imitate everything that she was. But her essence is something that I understood once I saw the family dynamic. It reminded me very much of my family.\u201d",
      "Thousands of interviews exist online of Rivera. While doing her research, Gonzalez couldn\u2019t believe the sexist questions and \u201ccomplete disregard to her humanity\u201d that Rivera experienced. Yet she persisted.",
      "\u201cShe was honest, she was authentic, as much as she could be, because either way people had an opinion about her,\u201d she says. When embodying \"La Diva de la Banda,\" Gonzalez says \u201cit was hard to separate\u201d what her character Rivera was going through and her own real life, including being assaulted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m such a visceral person that I do pull a lot from my own life. And then just knowing her life and what she had experienced ... Sometimes I still sit and I ponder her. I listen to her music, and I sob for her.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis movie is a Chicana, feminist story of someone finding her fight and finding it in her own way, and finding fight enough to not just protect herself, but to protect those who didn\u2019t know they needed protection,\u201d Gonzalez reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story to anyone who\u2019s never felt worthy, who\u2019s never felt good enough, more beautiful enough, talented enough, and still stood up in the face of adversity and went for it.\u201d",
      "Legs stretched across her new couch, a golden glow embracing the downtown skyline, Gonzalez shares what comes next for her.",
      "An artist through and through, she\u2019s been writing songs for an EP and has been performing live at historic venues \u2014 something she didn\u2019t feel she had the confidence to do before \u201cJenni.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis film has broken me open to exploring, to leaving no leaf unturned in my life,\u201d she says.",
      "She\u2019s also manifesting becoming the next rom-com queen. \u201cBut not just any. I want to be what Sandra Bullock was to the \u201890s to today. I think our last rom-com queen was maybe Anne Hathaway or Emma Stone. I want to do that, but me.\u201d",
      "Smirking, she pauses before talking about herself as the leading lady in \u201cJenni.\u201d",
      "\u201cI even saw moments in \u2018Jenni\u2019 where I was like, \u2018Oh yeah, I could do it. Yeah, she\u2019s a little charming f------!\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cNewsflash, any overweight white guy with a beard looks just like me. What are we talking about?\u201d the retired Philadelphia Eagle center joked as he and his new ESPN colleagues looked at footage from the contest Dec. 16 on\u00a0\"Monday Night Football Countdown.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s an easy competition,\" Jason Kelce continued. \"There is absolutely nothing unique about any of these gentlemen other than they are large people with beards and of Caucasian complexion.\u201d",
      "Dozens of bearded men wearing Eagles green showed up to the contest. Some took off their shirts to flaunt their bellies, just as Jason Kelce did after his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, scored a touchdown during the\u00a0Chiefs's winning  January 2024 playoff game against the Buffalo Bills.",
      "\u201cYou guys know exactly why they are doing that,\u201d Jason Kelce said. \u201cSometimes when you are enjoying a few beverages and it\u2019s cold outside\u2026\"",
      "Though Jason Kelce initially downplayed the idea of the contest, he eventually conceded that some of entrants looked a lot like him.",

      "Kylie Kelce, who's expecting baby No. 4 with her husband, also suggested contestants should try to nail down her husband's style. \u201cShoot for a heavy sweater,\u201d she said, while offering a handful of other ideas, including velour sweatsuits.",
      "As for shoes, she added, \u201cI do know it\u2019s winter in Philadelphia, but let's be real, flip-flops. If you\u2019re going to commit, commit.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce isn't the only celebrity to be honored with a look-alike contest in recent weeks.",

While they stepped back from royal duties in 2020 and agreed to no longer go by His/Her Royal Highness (HRH), they each kept their Sussex titles.",
      "Today, the couple continues to use duke and duchess publicly and professionally, particularly for their work as part of the Archewell Foundation. They do not, however, officially represent the British monarchy or perform official royal duties on its behalf.",
      "In a January 2023 interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Harry briefly addressed the question of why he and Meghan continued to use their Sussex titles in an interview with Anderson Cooper.",

      "Were Harry and Meghan\u2019s titles taken away?",
      "No, Harry and Meghan's titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not taken away by the British royal family. However, their titles have changed since their infamous decision to \"step back\" as senior members of the royal family.",
      "Following their 2020 announcement, Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying that Harry and Meghan would no longer use the HRH prefix since they were \u201cno longer working members of the Royal Family.\u201d",
      "Since relocating to the U.S., Harry and Meghan continue to be referred to by the British royal family and the public as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.",
      "The couple\u2019s children, Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3, also have their own titles. Following the death of the queen in September 2022, they became eligible to use the titles of \u201cprince\u201d and \u201cprincess.\u201d",

      "To the public, Harry might be known as a prince, but at home, he has nicknames just like the rest of us. In their 2022 Netflix docuseries \u201cHarry & Meghan,\u201c the Sussexes playfully revealed that Meghan calls Harry \u201cHaz\u201d and \u201cH,\u201d while Harry calls Meghan \u201cM.\u201d"

      "\"Wicked,\" which premieres in theaters Nov. 22, is part one of two films inspired by the hit Broadway musical of the same name. \"Wicked: Part 2,\" which is now called \"Wicked: For Good,\" will be released about a year later, on Nov. 21, 2025.",
      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",

      "A time jump",
      "Like the 2024 film, Act 1 of \"Wicked\" ends with \"Defying Gravity.\" When the curtain rises again after a 15-minute intermission, a lot has changed.",
      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",
      "Yang confirms there will be a time jump in Part 2 of \"Wicked.\"",
      "\"Right when we pick up, Glinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen\u00a0(Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,\" Yang says. \"The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "\"The story is so flexible with how it relates to our real world,\" Yang adds.",
      "A love triangle",
      "Act 2 of the musical also delivers on lingering chemistry and Elphaba's unrequited feelings for Fiyero.",
      "While Elphaba resigned herself to being \"not that girl\" in Act 1, audience members learn in the second act that the reason Fiyero joined the Wizard's army was to take an active role in searching for Elphaba, who has been missing in action but speaking out against the Wizard, his leadership and his treatment of Animals (sentient animals).",
      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",
      "A transformation",
      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",
      "Elphaba visits Nessarose in Act 2, and the younger sister airs her resentment. Elphaba then casts a spell on Nessarose's silver shoes, allowing her to walk. Boq responds by announcing his intentions to leave and declare his true affections for Glinda.",
      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: For Good\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",
      "New songs",
      "By breaking up \"Wicked\" into two films, composer Stephen Schwartz and screenplay writer Winnie Holzman had \"freedom\" to let scenes and moments \"breathe.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of scenes that Winnie wrote, there were a couple of songs that I tried for the first movie that we wound up not putting in the movie, but the essence of what we were trying to accomplish got into the movie,\" Schwartz says.",
      "While there aren't any new songs to Part 1, there will be in Part 2.",
      "\"There are two new songs in the second movie because they felt they were dramatically necessary,\" Schwartz says.",
      "But will any songs get cut?",

So, using her powers to control the weather, Madame Morrible summons the tornado that lands a house on Nessarose, bringing Dorothy Gale to Oz.

      "Meanwhile, Glinda confronts the Wizard after witnessing Elphaba's \"death,\" bringing the remnants of her melting: Elphaba's hat and the green bottle she always carried that belonged to her mother.",
      "When the Wizard sees the green elixir, he realizes that Elphaba was his biological child, finally unmasking the identity of the man Elphaba's mother had an affair with at the very beginning of the story.",
      "Jeff Goldblum confirms that he's the figure singing in the part of the opening song, \"No One Mourns the Wicked,\" which shows Elphaba's mother having an affair. (He's also credited in the song on the movie's official soundtrack.)",
      "\"You don't see me,\" he says. \"I have this drink, and that's a little mysterious and that will come to light.\"",
      "The camerawork keeps the man's face just out of each frame, so audiences \"aren't supposed to know that it's me,\" he says. But there's a tiny moment for careful listeners that connect the mysterious man to the Wizard in the first film, he says.",
      "After his introduction in \"Wicked,\" Goldblum's version of the Wizard performs a little tap dance and sings, \"You've got to give people what they want,\" in a similar tune to the part he sings in the overture.",

      "So wait, the Wicked Witch of the West is alive?",
      "Yes, deviating from the plot of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Wicked Witch of the West is alive at the end of the \"Wicked\" musical.",
      "Elphaba's fate with the scarecrow Fiyero is left unknown.",
      "The musical's ending also differs from Maguire's original book, which sees Elphaba actually melt and die at the hands of Dorothy. Maguire went on to write several sequels to \"Wicked,\" focusing on different Ozian characters, including \"Son of a Witch,\" about Elphaba and Fiyero's son.",
      "So could there be a sequel to the \"Wicked\" musical?",
      "\"We actually have a notion for something, and it's not from Gregory Maguire book,\" Schwartz says. \"That's really all I can say right now. It is something Winnie and I are talking about and exploring, but it actually goes back to Baum, not back to Gregory.\""

      "HBO confirmed in January (after Variety reported in 2023) that the highly anticipated third installment of the comedy series would take place in Thailand and had shared bits of casting news since then. Now, on Dec. 16, HBO dropped a first full-length trailer, in which viewers can glimpse this new group of vacationers misbehaving. It also announced a release date for Feb. 16.",

      "Coolidge and Jon Gries were the only cast members to appear in both Season One and Season Two, though it is very unlikely Coolidge\u2019s character will make another appearance due to her fate in the Season Two finale. (Coolidge declared her character \u201cdefinitely dead\u201d in her Jan. 15 speech for winning the Emmy Award for best supporting actress in a drama series.)",
      "Coolidge said during\u00a0Variety\u2019s \u201cActors on Actors\u201d series in June 2023 she hoped the show\u2019s creator, Mike White, continues Gries\u2019 character Greg\u2019s journey in the series.",

      "Gries has not been confirmed to appear in Season Three, leaving fans to keep an eye out for another appearance from Greg \u2014 and as White told Entertainment Weekly last year, maybe some other characters.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to just be full-on anthology, but I think it\u2019s more fun to have little threads through the show,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf the show goes on for a couple of seasons, it would be fun to have an all-star season.\u201d",
      "When is the \u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 release date?",
      "\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d Season Three will debut Sunday, Feb. 16, HBO revealed Dec. 16."

      "In May 2023, Paramount Network said that the fifth season of \u201cYellowstone\" would be the last one. This came after reports that scheduling issues and contention existed between Kevin Costner and the show's creator, Taylor Sheridan. Kevin Costner announced in June 2024 that he was not returning to \"Yellowstone\" ahead of the premiere of Season 5, Part 2.",

      "They had it at a friend's house, the wedding planner was under \"strict confidentiality,\" verbal invitations went out \"just prior\" to the ceremony and the hired vendors thought the event they were servicing was a family reunion.

      "\u201cHe was the first person that I told after my parents told me, and so I came home and realized that as disorienting as the news was \u2014 as sort of confused and adrift as I felt knowing that my family wasn\u2019t who I thought we were \u2014 when I saw him, I knew who this family was,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI knew that no matter what I was feeling with my parents in that moment, I belonged here.\u201d",
      "Washington learned that her biological father is a sperm donor and not the man who raised her after sharing with her parents that she agreed to appear on \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d according to her memoir.",

      "Assad was swept from power by a lightning-quick rebel offensive after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family\u2019s autocratic rule, and the opulent trappings of a regime that inflicted terror and poverty on Syria's people are now clear for all to see.",
      "When NBC News gained access to the squat, modernist palace perched in the mountains above the capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, it was relatively calm, despite the appearance of having been robbed. Fighters from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, which led the rebel overthrow, stood guard, checking cars in a bid to put a stop to any more thefts from the building that was Assad\u2019s main residence until he was forced into exile.",
      "Inside, doors opened with a hefty sweep into a cavernous, marble-lined dining room with a table that can comfortably seat three on each end.\u00a0The chandeliers above appeared to be the finest crystal.",
      "It also appeared that no expense had been spared at one of Assad's guest palaces nearby. While one room had been torched and its chandeliers were covered in ash, some of the others looked like they might have been robbed, although art remained on the walls and the mother-of-pearl inlay was still in the doors.",
      "New carpets on renovated staircases were still under the plastic they came with, as were expensive-looking pieces of furniture, giving the impression that Assad had been planning to be in power for a long time.",
      "Back in his own palace, a room was set up as a doctor\u2019s surgery and another for a barber \u2014 complete with the chrome and leather presidential barber\u2019s chair.",
      "Elsewhere, there was an expansive library large enough to warrant a rolling ladder. Books including storybooks for toddlers and guides to Uruguay, Croatia and Sudan still lined its wood-paneled walls.\u00a0A copy of Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Country?\u201d and one of anthropologist Sue Black\u2019s \u201cAll That Remains\u201d \u2014 a memoir recounting her experiences working in war and disaster zones, had also apparently been on Assad's reading list.",
      "Now that he is gone, the reality of what happened under his rule is being exposed. As the Assads lived a life of luxury, their regime locked up, tortured and killed thousands of its citizens. Richard Engel reported from Damascus and David Hodari from London."

    "title": "Medication abortions may be more painful than women expect, study finds",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 23:30:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Many women are surprised by how much pain they experience during a medication abortion, a study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health found.",
    "story": [
      "Many women are surprised by how much pain they experience during a medication abortion, a study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health found.",
      "More than 60% of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions, meaning a person takes two drugs, often at home, to end a pregnancy. The study, which surveyed women in the U.K., found that many don\u2019t feel prepared for the amount of pain they may feel during the procedure.",
      "Pain does not mean the procedure is unsafe, but some women may feel caught off guard based on the information health providers gave them.",
      "\u201cThere is a bit of a reckoning in the world of gynecology right now and the pain patients are experiencing during procedures,\u201d said Dr. Alyssa Colwill, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.",
      "In the study, researchers looked at survey responses from about 1,600 women in the U.K. who had undergone a medication abortion and then answered questions about the experience. Most were between the ages of 20 and 39 and half had never given birth.",
      "More than 90% of respondents ranked their pain at least a 4 out of a maximum of 10, and about half said the pain was more than they had expected. About 40% said their pain was severe, between an 8 and a 10 on the pain scale.",
      "Women are often told to expect cramping akin to strong menstrual cramps during a medication abortion, both in the U.K. and in the U.S. While some respondents felt that was an accurate description, others said they felt unprepared and that the pain aspect of medication abortion was \u201csugar-coated\u201d or downplayed.",
      "One woman who responded to the survey said: \u201cPain was so much stronger than period pain, it was like having contractions in labour. I\u2019ve given birth three times and the pain really wasn\u2019t too much different from that pain, the cramping contraction pain.\u201d",
      "Another said: \u201cI think it\u2019s worth reassuring people that just because it [pain] is stated severe it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be. I spent more time worrying about the possibilities of the side effects than needed!\u201d",
      "The researchers concluded that women wanted detailed, realistic pain counseling and general preparatory advice, including details from firsthand experiences that illustrate the range of pain women may experience during medication abortion.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is the acknowledgement that everyone\u2019s experience of pain during a medical abortion will be different,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Hannah McCulloch, an evaluation researcher at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be realistic about what women experience during medical abortion in order to provide meaningful patient-centred care.\u201d",
      "Medication abortions involve taking two pills. The first, mifepristone, blocks the hormone progesterone, which is critical for a pregnancy to continue. One or two days after taking mifepristone, the person takes a second drug \u2014 usually misoprostol \u2014 which causes the uterus to cramp and soften and the cervix to dilate so the pregnancy can pass, usually within 24 hours of taking misoprostol, according to Colwill.",
      "\u201cThat process, the uterus having to cramp and expel the pregnancy, inherently is going to cause pain,\u201d she said, adding that many factors play into how much pain each person feels.",
      "Women who may report less pain with a medication abortion include those who have experienced labor or given birth vaginally and women who have painful menstrual cramps every month, such as those who have endometriosis, Colwill said.",
      "\u201cUnderstanding these past experiences, and things like how they experience Pap smears and vaginal exams, can help us better support patients to be prepared for how pain may be for them,\u201d she added, noting that she was not surprised to see many women did not feel they were adequately prepared to manage pain during a medication abortion.",
      "Medication abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Serious side effects occur in less than 0.5% of people who take Mifeprex, the brand-name version of mifepristone, according to the drug\u2019s label, and the number of women managing their own abortions has increased since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cPatients need to be adequately informed about what to expect and be told what we know about how to manage the pain. Pain is downplayed in medicine in general and particularly in women\u2019s health and obstetrics and gynecology,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of advancing new standards in reproductive health at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "Even if a person accesses abortion medication through telehealth, Grossman said people should still be counseled on what to expect and how to treat the intense pain and nausea that can happen during the procedure. His best advice, he said, for managing pain during a medication abortion is to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, such as ibuprofen, at the same time as misoprostol. If possible, he recommends also taking an anti-nausea medication such as metoclopramide, which requires a prescription.",
      "Colwill said that acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is also an option, but NSAIDs do a better job of blocking this specific pain.",
      "Putting a heating pad, a hot water bottle or over-the-counter trans-electrical nerve stimulation pads on the lower belly can also help \u201cconfuse\u201d nerves in the area and help relieve pain,\u00a0Grossman said.",
      "He said it\u2019s also important to understand what pain is \u201cnormal\u201d and when it may be time to seek medical help, especially in situations where people are at home.",
      "Pain in the middle of the lower abdomen is normal, for example, but pain higher up or pain just on one side could be a sign that something is wrong, such as an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.",
      "If someone experiences severe pain on one side of the abdomen or pelvis, they should go to the emergency room, Grossman said. \u201cIf they have mild to moderate pain on one side, they might try to talk to a clinician first by phone. But if there\u2019s any question, they should go to an emergency department,\u201d he added.",
      "Ectopic pregnancies are detected on ultrasounds, however, \u201cmany people have a medication abortion without having an ultrasound and it can even be missed on an ultrasound,\u201d Grossman said.",
      "Medication abortion will not work for an ectopic pregnancy, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Pain beyond 24 hours after a pregnancy is passed, especially if the person also has a fever or is vomiting, could be a sign of infection, he said.",
      "Women should also not discount the importance of moral support, he added: \u201cFeeling supported and having someone there makes a big difference, too.\u201d"

      "Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew has been caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the country on national security grounds.",
      "The scandal-hit younger brother of King Charles III was \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with the alleged spy, Britain\u2019s High Court said in a written ruling Thursday, which referred to the Chinese national as H6. The court lifted an anonymity order protecting his identity Monday, allowing him to be named as Yang Tengbo.",
      "Yang had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K., Thursday's ruling by judges Charles Bourne, Stephen Smith and Stewart Eldon said, adding that British intelligence agencies feared he was attempting to gain influence over a member of the royal family.",
      "In a statement released through his lawyers, Yang said the \u201cwidespread description of me as a \u2018spy\u2019 is entirely untrue.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, Andrew forged a relationship of \u201csignificant degree\u201d with Yang, marked by an \u201cunusual degree of trust,\u201d the court ruling said, adding that he was \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with the Chinese national, whom he invited to his 60th birthday party in 2020.",
      "Yang could reportedly \u201cact on behalf\u201d of the prince in engagements with potential partners and investors in China, the ruling said.",
      "Andrew\u2019s office said in a statement that he\u00a0\u201cceased all contact with the individual after concerns were raised.\u201d It added that he \u201cmet the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed.\u201d",
      "Yang also sought connections with \u201cprominent U.K. figures,\u201d including politicians, which could be \u201cleveraged\u201d for political interference by China, the court said.",
      "Yang was considered a \u201crisk to national security,\u201d prompting former Secretary of State Suella Braverman to conclude in March 2023 that the ban on his entry to Britain was \u201cjustified and proportionate,\u201d the ruling added.",
      "Pictures of Yang alongside former British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron have been published in U.K. news outlets, although it is unclear when and where the meetings took place.",
      "In his statement, Yang said that he had \u201cdone nothing wrong or unlawful\u201d and that the concerns raised by Britain\u2019s Home Office \u201care ill-founded.\u201d",
      "For the royal family, it is another embarrassing revelation about Andrew, a onetime war hero who served in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and flew a number of missions during the 1982 conflict with Argentina over the remote\u00a0Falkland Islands.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a\u00a0civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleges Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "Giuffre has long alleged she was forced in the 1990s to have sex with Andrew after notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his\u00a0confidant, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, trafficked her to him. Maxwell, 62, was jailed for 20-years after a jury concluded that she played a pivotal part\u00a0in recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "There have also been several high-profile spy cases involving China in the U.S.",
      "Federal prosecutors this year charged Linda Sun, a former top aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering.",
      "Sun, 41, used her position to aid Chinese officials and covertly sharing internal documents with Beijing, prosecutors alleged in court papers. She was also accused of blocking Taiwanese diplomats from contacting the state government.",
      "In return, Sun received millions of dollars in transactions for the China-based business activities of her husband, Chris Hu, a job for her cousin in China and tickets to various sporting and cultural events, the indictment said.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's defense minister has vowed that it would maintain \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d in the Gaza Strip after fighting ends in the Palestinian enclave, a day after raising hopes that a ceasefire and hostage deal was imminent.",
      "Israel was \u201ccloser to a ceasefire deal than we have ever been,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a closed-door parliamentary committee hearing Monday. The comment was confirmed to NBC News by an Israeli lawmaker who was present.",
      "While ceasefire talks have broken down multiple times in the past, two U.S. officials and an Israeli official\u00a0last week told\u00a0NBC News that Hamas relented on key points to securing an agreement.",
      "According to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Hamas agreed that Israeli forces would remain in Gaza temporarily after the end of hostilities, and Hamas would provide a comprehensive list of hostages, including American citizens, to be released.\u00a0Hamas would also see a large number of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel as part of the deal, the sources said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported these concessions.\u00a0Hamas has not confirmed to NBC News or others\u2019 reporting that it has agreed to Israeli troops in Gaza.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that \u201cserious and positive discussions\u201d had taken place in Doha, Qatar, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and that reaching a ceasefire agreement and prisoner exchange was possible if Israel \u201cstops setting new conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday morning, Katz said Israel would maintain control over Gaza after the fighting ends.",
      "\"After the military and governmental power of Hamas in Gaza is defeated, Israel will securely control Gaza with full freedom of action\" he posted on X, likening this outcome to Israel\u2019s current control over the occupied West Bank.",
      "Katz did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for details on what \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d would mean. But the comparison to the West Bank underscores a key concern for Palestinians and their supporters: the fear of prolonged Israeli military presence in Gaza, akin to the West Bank, where Israel maintains ultimate control over territory and settlements, and carries out regular raids in the area.",
      "Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, said Katz' comparisons with the West Bank suggest that Israel is \u201cgoing to have full control entering by any means at any given time.\u201d",
      "\"That\u2019s a completely fair enough interpretation, considering that we know what happens in the West Bank,\" he said. \"Is that what a ceasefire agreement is going to say? I have my doubts.\"",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli hostage negotiator and frequent critic of Netanyahu's government, said he did not believe Katz' remark that Israel had never been closer to a ceasefire.",
      "\"I have difficult accepting that Hamas has dropped its fundamental demand of an obligation to end the war including full Israeli withdrawal,\" he told NBC News via WhatsApp.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has injected urgency into negotiations, repeating Monday his threat that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if no deal was in place by the time he was inaugurated Jan. 20.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News on Friday that Trump\u2019s pressure was a major factor in Hamas relenting on two key issues during ceasefire and hostage-release talks with Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when\" President Joe Biden \"presented his proposal,\u201d the official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure a ceasefire agreement before the end of the month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week in a press conference in Tel Aviv.",
      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior Biden administration official said.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack have languished for months. According to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people were killed in the country during the attack and around 250 people were taken hostage \u2014\u00a0dozens of whom\u00a0are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "More than 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israel's military campaign following the attack, according to the enclave's health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

    "title": "Germany set for snap elections after chancellor loses confidence vote",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:36:19 GMT",
    "summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence, paving the way for early elections in February.",
    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence Monday, paving the way for early elections in February and ending a turbulent year at the polls for several of Europe's leaders and governing parties.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote with the expectation of losing it, but with the hope that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of violating his trust at the time after Lindner publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon. The chancellor subsequently announced he'd call for a no-confidence vote.",
      "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier now has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election, and he is expected to do so after Christmas. New elections will then have to be held within 60 days of his decision.",
      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",
      "If Steinmeier allows the dissolution of parliament, something he is likely to rubber-stamp given his largely ceremonial role, a vote will take place just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled.",
      "Scholz called the confidence vote after weeks of infighting with his coalition partners on a 2025 budget and Germany's future economic policy prior to Lindner's firing.",
      "Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, a leading British investment bank, told CNBC that Germany's leaders are likely going to find agreement on fiscal policy regardless of the new election results.",
      "\"Even if within say the first three to six months of the new administration you don\u2019t get changes to the debt brake, if they have a big enough majority, eventually I think economic conditions will just force them to accept the reality that they need a fiscal stimulus,\" Pickering said.",
      "While the Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0led by Friedrich Merz, is ahead in the polls, according to Reuters, the far-right Alternative for\u00a0Germany\u00a0(AfD) could also help to shape the new government.",
      "Fresh from September's success in regional elections in Thuringia, when it became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, the party is also polling well at a national level.",
      "However, it is unlikely the group would be able to govern because other parties have refused to align themselves with the far right, despite Germany\u2019s parliamentary system traditionally producing coalitions.",
      "Germany's snap elections come after the Labour Party won power in the U.K. for the first time in over a decade and French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in his country, which led to political turmoil.",
      "Facing pressure from both the right and the left, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned earlier this month after he lost a confidence vote that\u00a0collapsed his government. It was the first time in more than six decades that a parliamentary coalition fell apart in France.",
      "Macron appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, a centrist, to replace Barnier last week in the hopes that he could bridge the deeply divided government."

      "The crew also captured the moment Shadi Tafesh arrived to find 10 members of his family lying together, lifeless and in pieces. His father's head was severed from his body. His sister, her husband and their two children were dismembered.",

      "Seven foreign tourists\u00a0were hospitalized in Fiji in a suspected case of alcohol poisoning at a luxury resort, Fijian and Australian officials said Monday.",
      "The guests, who, according to local media, included an American, were hospitalized after they drank cocktails\u00a0at a bar at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka. The group also included four Australians and two unidentified foreign nationals.",
      "They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, The Associated Press reported, citing Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson Jemesa Tudravu.",
      "Two people remained stable in the hospital Monday, Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka was quoted as saying by the AP, while five others have been discharged.",
      "The cause of the guests\u2019 illness was not immediately clear, and officials said that until test results were available it was too soon to say whether contaminated alcohol played a role.",
      "The case is similar to one in the Southeast Asian country of Laos last month in which six tourists, including an American and two Australian teenagers, died after they drank alcohol tainted with methanol.",
      "Gavoka said there were no other reports of similar illness at the resort or elsewhere in Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago nation that is home to about 930,000 people. He said the Warwick resort, which is on the Coral Coast of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, \u201cholds a strong reputation.\u201d",

      "David Sandoe, of Australia, whose daughter and granddaughter were among those affected, told Sky News Australia on Monday that they were headed back to Australia after having been cleared for release and that the hotel and Fiji police had been \u201cfantastic\u201d in keeping everyone informed.",
      "Australia has also updated its travel advisory for Fiji to warn about the risk of alcoholic drinks\u2019 being spiked or poisoned with methanol.",
