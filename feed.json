      "Zakir Hussain, one of India\u2019s most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to a global audience, has died",
      "NEW DELHI -- Zakir Hussain, one of India's most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to global audiences, died on Sunday. He was 73.",
      "The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cHis prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music.",
      "Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.",
      "The son of legendary tabla artist Ustad Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he began performing alongside India\u2019s classical music legends during his teens.",
      "In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band \u201cShakti\u201d with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences.",
      "In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year.",
      "Hussain\u2019s \u201cShakti\u201d won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, B\u00e9la Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009.",
      "In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India\u2019s second-highest civilian award.",
      "Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters."

It was shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15% \u201cfresh\u201d rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.",

The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals.",

      "ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E",
      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "The settlement agreement was signed Friday, the same day a Florida federal judge ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for separate depositions in the case next week. The settlement means that sworn testimony is no longer required.",
      "The agreement bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "But a representative of the Maddens confirmed to NBC that they were on tour in the Midwest during the VMAs, while her father said he doesn\u2019t remember the drive home of more than five hours. The woman\u2019s friend who reportedly drove her to the awards has since died, NBC reported.",
      "The woman had first sued Combs, alleging she was raped at an after-party, and then amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, also was at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z said in a statement that the article proves Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame.",
      "\u201cThis incident didn\u2019t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn\u2019t realize it yet, but, soon.\u201d",
      "Buzbee told The Associated in an email that if someone raises a new issue which didn\u2019t previously exist, his legal team's job is to continue collecting facts and evidence.",
      "Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, asked the court to dismiss the case, saying in a statement, \u201cIt is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press.\u201d",
      "The woman admitted to making \u201csome mistakes\u201d when recalling that night, but said she stands by her allegations.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Teny R. Geragos, said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cYesterday, a lawyer admitted that over 50 people falsely claimed to be victims. Today, for the second time this week, a Buzbee plaintiff has been exposed. This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The unnamed woman said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said Combs and Jay-Z then barged into the room, along with another unnamed celebrity, and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",
      "Jay-Z, a 24-time Grammy award winning rapper, producer and music mogul, anonymously sued Buzbee last month, alleging he was attempting to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Jay-Z said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement, which had the \u201copposite effect\u201d on him.",
      "Buzbee previously said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is \u201cstupid and laughable\u201d and his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation.",
      "Buzbee announced at a news conference in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "His firm, which has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers, began filing a wave of lawsuits against the hip-hop mogul a few weeks later.",
      "Combs was denied bail a third time last month. He has pleaded not guilty to charges he coerced and abused women for years and faces trial in May.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out,\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d",
      "While frequently photographed together at events, they also have been business competitors. Diddy launched his Bad Boy Records around the same time Jay-Z launched his Roc-A-Fella record label."

      "NEW DELHI -- A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month.",
      "A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun\u2019s release for \u201cPushpa 2: The Rule\u201d in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on Dec. 4.",
      "Arjun was arrested after the woman\u2019s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor\u2019s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater\u2019s management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",
      "Police have already arrested the theater\u2019s owner and two of his employees in connection with the case.",
      "A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported.",
      "The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater\u2019s main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede.",
      "The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was \u201cheartbroken by the tragic incident.\u201d He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman\u2019s family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son.",
      "Deadly stampedes are relatively common in India, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few crowd safety measures."

      "Donald Trump got something this year that no other person designated Time magazine's Person of the Year had ever received",
      "Time magazine gave Donald Trump something it has never done for a Person of the Year designee: a lengthy fact-check of claims he made in an accompanying interview.",
      "The fact-check accompanies a transcript of what the president-elect told the newsmagazine's journalists. Described as a \u201c12 minute read,\u201d it calls into question 15 separate statements that Trump made.",
      "It was the second time Trump earned the Time accolade; he also won in 2016, the first year he was elected president. Time editors said it wasn't a particularly hard choice over other finalists Kamala Harris, Elon Musk, Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate Middleton.",
      "Time said Friday that no other Person of the Year has been fact-checked in the near-century that the magazine has annually written about the figure that has had the greatest impact on the news. But it has done the same for past interviews with the likes of Joe Biden, Netanyahu and Trump.",
      "Such corrections have been a sticking point for Trump and his team in the past, most notably when ABC News did it during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris this fall. There was no immediate response to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "In the piece, Time called into question statements Trump made about border security, autism and the size of a crowd at one of his rallies. When the president-elect talked about the \u201cmassive\u201d mandate he had received from voters, Time pointed out that former President Barack Obama won more electoral votes the two times he had run for president.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia\u2019s decades-long cinema ban",
      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different \u2014 and the star of \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d now has an award.",
      "Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award \u2014 and the glitzy festival itself \u2014 is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry.",
      "\u201cMy heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,\u201d Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. \u201cI used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.\u201d",
      "The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training.",
      "The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom\u2019s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world\u2019s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman \u201chas really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don\u2019t see the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens \u2014 by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.)",
      "The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring.",
      "\u201cThese facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,\u201d said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. \u201cToday, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, \u2018I cannot implement my imagination.\u2019\u201d",
      "The facilities are one part of the equation \u2014 the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues.",
      "In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in \u201cMandoob\u201d (\u201cNight Courier\u201d) and changing social norms in \u201cNaga.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that\u2019s what reaches the world,\u201d Elshehri says of the changing shift. \u201cWhen you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.\u201d",
      "But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society.",
      "As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold.",
      "\u201cWe certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. \u201cThe Goat Life,\u201d a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question.",
      "Even \u201cMy Driver and I,\u201d featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship.",
      "Now in 2024, the film is a success story \u2014 a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it.",
      "\u201cI see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,\u201d Dakheelallah said. \u201cWe need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

      "Paula Abdul and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Paula Abdul and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show.",
      "Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.",
      "\u201cI am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,\" Abdul said in a statement Friday. \"This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "In his own statement, Lythgoe said, \u201cWe live in a troubling time where a person is now automatically assumed to be guilty until proven innocent, a process that can take years. That is why, like Paula, I am glad to be able to put this behind me. I know the truth and that gives me great comfort.\u201d",
      "The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul\u2019s attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "Lythgoe said at the time that he was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the allegations, which he called \u201can appalling smear.\u201d",
      "After other lawsuits were filed alleging sexual misconduct, Lythgoe stepped down in January from his role as a judge on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d",
      "The 75-year-old English-born producer has been a prominent TV producer for decades in both the U.K. and the U.S., working on reality competition shows including \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \u201cone of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\u201d",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \u201cbegan shoving his tongue down her throat.\u201d Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",
      "\u201cIn tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cbut ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.\u201d",
      "Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.",
      "In 2015, Abdul became a judge on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance,\u201d appearing alongside Lythgoe.",
      "Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.",
      "Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.",
      "In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said \u201cWhile Paula\u2019s history of erratic behavior is well known, I can\u2019t pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.\u201d"

      "Ice Cube could have chased trends to keep up with today's rap sound for his latest release, but instead, he stayed loyal to his signature style since the N",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Ice Cube could have chased trends to keep up with today\u2019s rap game for his latest release, but instead, he stayed loyal to the gritty West Coast gangsta sound that\u2019s been his signature since his early N.W.A. days and flourishing solo career.",
      "Ice Cube stuck to his streetwise storytelling roots while inserting some West Coast rap party vibes on his 11th studio album \u201cMan Down,\u201d which was released on the same day as Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise project late last month. Ice Cube's new album cracked the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s top rap albums chart \u2014 his first time in 14 years \u2014 debuting at No. 8.",
      "The rap icon made \u201cMan Down\u201d to satisfy his loyal listeners. He's known for churning out classic hip-hop jams such as \u201cIt Was a Good Day,\u201d \u201cCheck Yo Self,\u201d \u201cNo Vaseline\u201d and \u201cSteady Mobbin.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to serve your clientele,\u201d Ice Cube said about \u201cMan Down,\u201d which features Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, E-40, Killer Mike, Xzibit, and Cypress Hill\u2019s B-Real. His latest project is his first since 2018\u2019s \u201cEverythang\u2019s Corrupt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people that got you here are the people you\u2019re making the music for so to speak,\u201d said Ice Cube, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A. in 2016. \u201cNot always for the new fan or the new kid that\u2019s just getting into music. That\u2019s not who you should be reaching for if you\u2019ve been in the game for almost four decades.\u201d",
      "In a recent interview, Ice Cube spoke with The Associated Press about his partnership with the NFL, the BIG3 basketball league and his thoughts after the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Ice Cube first introduced the Contract with Black America to political leaders from both parties in 2020, and four years later, he\u2019s still driving the conversation with the NFL.",
      "He said CWBA's partnership with the league has gained traction since joining forces in 2022, creating opportunities for Black-owned businesses. The partnership between Cube's initiative and the NFL focuses on identifying opportunities in finance, tech and production.",
      "\u201cWhen they have an opening, they\u2019ll give our people that we\u2019ve put in front of them a shot at getting a job,\u201d said Ice Cube, whose CWBA aims to address the wealth gap between Black and white Americans and economic inclusion.",
      "The CWBA seeks to remove barriers and open doors.",
      "\u201cAll we want is a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAll companies have to step up and earn that job. We just say \u2018Hey, let us know when you got an opening in tech. ... and let us put a few companies in front of you. And let the best company win. They\u2019ve picked a few of our companies and now they've gotten contracts with the NFL, which is great.\u201d",
      "Ice Cube hopes the CWBA will extend beyond the NFL, encouraging other companies to adopt the initiative as well. In 2020, he presented his proposal to both main political parties, including Donald Trump's campaign, a move that sparked criticism from those who thought he was supporting Trump at the time.",
      "But that wasn't the case, Ice Cube said. Whichever party supports CWBA, he'll listen.",
      "\u201cPolitically, they would have to show me an appetite for working with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not a politician. I never went to these political parties and asked them for anything. I'm still down to help.\u201d",
      "While Ice Cube has made a mark in music, he's done the same in film too.",
      "But with Hollywood grappling with challenges like the aftermath of two major strikes and the lingering effects of the pandemic, Ice Cube has chosen the independent route for his upcoming projects. For now, he's not being reliant on major studios.",
      "\u201cIt'd be better to make independent movies and not go through the studio system,\u201d said Ice Cube, who starred in the late John Singleton 's \u201cBoyz in the Hood,\u201d \u201cAre We There Yet?\u201c and the \u201d Barbershop,\u201d \u201c Ride Along \u201d and \u201cFriday\u201d franchise films. He also wrote, starred in, produced and directed the 1998 film \u201cThe Players Club.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith independent movies, I can do some great work that\u2019s not sterilized by the studio,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they make a big movie, they spend a lot of money. When they make a low budget movie, they want to cut it at every little nook and cranny to where sometimes they cut out the best parts. You have to combat that.\u201d",
      "Ice Cube created a haven for athletes who seemed to have left their pro basketball days behind. Through his co-founded league, BIG3, he offered them a second shot \u2014 a sanctuary to keep their passion for the game alive.",
      "His 3-on-3 basketball league is gearing up for its sixth straight year, with an expanded 11-week season kicking off in summer 2025. Since its launch in 2017, the league has evolved, transitioning to a traditional city-based model where teams host home games, moving away from its original road-game-only structure.",
      "Earlier this year, BIG3 sold its first franchise in Los Angeles to a group of investors for $10 million. The games stream on CBS through Paramount+, and some stream on X.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s growing every day. We do have some great new owners and figuring out with them the direction of the league, where should we be and planting our flag,\u201d Ice Cube said about BIG3, which has starred former NBA players like Joe Johnson, Rashard Lewis, Stephen Jackson and Corey Maggette. Last year, Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown became the first active NBA player to participate in a BIG3 game.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re getting into the nuts and bolts of a big-time sports at the highest level,\u201d Ice Cube said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be there and it\u2019s a challenge every day. It\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be. To affect sports on that level, it\u2019s pretty cool from somebody who had to sneak in the Forum to see my first Laker game.\u201d",
      "If the post-presidential election blues still have you in a funk heading into the inauguration on Jan. 20, Ice Cube has a bit of advice: Stop stressing.",
      "Worrying won't change the outcome, he said.",
      "\u201cStop thinking about the future so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future is unknown. The future is anxiety, the past is depression. ... You got to believe in the future. Whatever made you strong enough to get to this point, you'll be strong enough to get you through whatever the future may bring. The key is to stop worrying about what\u2019s going to happen and pay attention to what is happening. Work accordingly.\""

      "Associated Press writer Lou Kesten has chosen his top 10 video games of 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been a rough year in the world of video games, which reeled from some high-profile flops (sorry, Suicide Squad and Star Wars fans) and a relentless series of developer layoffs. Fortunately, indie designers stepped up to fill in the gaps. And toward the end of the year, a few AAA studios rallied with ambitious, big-budget adventures.",
      "The top 10 games of 2024 recall a brighter age when it seemed like anything was possible in our virtual worlds. Here\u2019s hoping the industry learns from their success.",
      "In a politically exhausting year, Japan\u2019s Studio Zero pulled off the seemingly impossible: rendering the process of reforming a corrupt world with something resembling \u2026 hope? The corruption that has beset the quasi-medieval Euchronia is quite literal, embodied by hideous mutants known (rather unsubtly) as \u201chumans.\u201d The fight to restore sanity blends stirring battles with unusually thoughtful reflections on justice, all with the eye-popping visuals you\u2019d expect from the creators of the Persona series.",
      "The last few years have brought a surge in so-called \u201cmetroidvanias\u201d \u2014 enormous two-dimensional mazes that blend arcade action with tricky puzzles. Solo designer Billy Basso\u2019s Animal Well is the apex, presenting a vast underground network whose inhabitants range from mice to flamingos. Every challenge you solve opens a smorgasbord of new challenges, and it\u2019s easy to get lost for hours in its eerie, hallucinatory world.",
      "In this drama from Sweden\u2019s Simigo, a young woman is invited to explore a hotel that\u2019s been seemingly abandoned by its owner, an avant-garde filmmaker. Every room has a puzzle, and the more you solve the deeper you fall under its spell. It\u2019s like being trapped in a David Lynch movie, where you\u2019re always questioning the boundaries between dreams and reality.",
      "BioWare, the studio behind landmark role-playing games like Mass Effect and the original Baldur\u2019s Gate, finally returns to its strengths with this fantasy epic. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, with a motley crew of fighters, mages and rogues joining forces against a world-threatening evil. The combat is engaging, the stories are unpredictable and the characters are endearingly loopy.",
      "The most endearing character of the year has to be the adorable protagonist of this adventure from Sony\u2019s Team Asobi. The spunky little robot is on a planet-hopping mission to rescue dozens of his fellow droids, with each stop presenting a fresh assortment of running, jumping and punching challenges. It\u2019s the sort of game we used to see more of on the PlayStation, and it\u2019s thoroughly delightful.",
      "Luisa is a burnt-out corporate drone who needs a break. So why not head to the Alps and cut loose by fighting some monsters? Compared to Metaphor and Dragon Age, the dungeons devised by Austria\u2019s Microbird Games are more tightly focused, given that you can only take a few magic spells on each expedition. But the puzzles are clever, and this oddball tourist town has other intriguing mysteries worth investigating.",
      "More dungeons, as Nintendo returns to Hyrule. At long last you get to play as Princess Zelda, who wields a scepter that allows her to duplicate the tools she needs to surmount obstacles \u2014 or summon creatures to fight her foes. Echoes combines the top-down action of 1987\u2019s original-recipe Zelda with the improvisation of last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d and should satisfy fans of both.",
      "Bethesda Softworks delivers a rarity, a AAA action-adventure in which the protagonist spends more time quietly figuring out the enigmas of the Egyptian pyramids and Vatican City than mindlessly shooting enemies. Veteran voice actor Troy Baker does a fine job standing in for Harrison Ford, the dialog sparkles and the graphics are stunningly detailed. It\u2019s one of 2024\u2019s biggest surprises \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, you do get to punch Nazis.",
      "This indie smash from solo developer LocalThunk looks simple: a solitaire version of poker in which you score points by racking up good hands. Throw in some jokers, though \u2014 say, a \u201cGreedy Joker\u201d that makes diamonds more valuable \u2014 and it gets complicated. The higher your score, the more jokers become available. It\u2019s a classic \u201cjust one more hand\u201d hook; don\u2019t download Balatro if you expect to get anything else done today.",
      "A team of indie developers led by Spelunky designer Derek Yu conjured up this tribute to the games of the 1980s. It\u2019s insanely ambitious, with 50 complete games ranging across every imaginable genre, from shoot-'em-ups to strategy to racing to role-playing. There\u2019s even a Pong variant. It\u2019s a feast for anyone who remembers the dawn of video games \u2014 or is too young to have been there."

      "NEW YORK -- At the end of every year, when critics rush to compile their best of the year lists, great art inevitably gets overlooked. A top 10 list doesn't leave a lot of room for discovery and, in music, that sometimes means the most innovative records lose out to make room for other titles. In this list, The Associated Press attempts to rectify that.",
      "Here are 10 of the top under-the-radar albums of the year, in no particular order, as chosen by AP Music Writer Maria Sherman.",
      "In a just world, Portuguese-born Danish singer Erika de Casier would be one of the biggest names in pop, for her retro-futuristic R&B deeply informed by the Y2K greats of the not-so-distant past. It\u2019s hard not to hear Aaliyah or Jennifer Lopez or Janet Jackson in her breathy vocal storytelling, but her songs are not simply nostalgic. They shapeshift in the inclusion of '90s U.K. garage production (\u201cEx-Girlfriend\u201d with Charli XCX collaborator Shygirl) or her creative collaborations, like on \u201cice\u201d with Florida rap duo They Hate Change.",
      "One-fourth of the rap collective Drain Gang \u2014 that\u2019s Bladee (pronounced \u201cBlade\u201d) \u2014 and emo rap prodigy Yung Lean teamed up for the surprise release \u201cPsykos\u201d earlier this year, a genre-allergic, rock-infused hip-hop collection of depressive pop. It's a fatalistic record for a lost, moony generation, and it may take a few listens for these Swedes to connect. But once their music does, it sounds like a surrealist document on the current moment.",
      "Sudanese Canadian singer Mustafa\u2019s \u201cDunya\u201d (which translates from Arabic to \u201cthe world\u201d) hits like ancient folkloric tradition and sounds like poetry. (It\u2019s Mustafa The Poet, after all, though he\u2019s also scored writing credits for the likes of The Weeknd,Shawn Mendes,Camila Cabello and the Jonas Brothers.) He\u2019s said the album works to \u201cpreserve and celebrate the ordinary life in the hood,\u201d what is delicately and purposefully articulated across vignettes of love, loss and his native Toronto. \u201cLeaving Toronto,\u201d specifically, is a tearjerker \u2014 a touching tribute to his city and his late brother, who was shot and killed last year.",
      "Pakistani American astral folk-jazz artist Arooj Aftab is celebrated in certain circles and lacks visibility in others: She\u2019s a Grammy winner who has been nominated the past three years in a row and is up for two more in 2025. She\u2019s performed at the White House. Earlier this month, she delivered an evocative set on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d a welcomed disruption from the kinds of artists who normally grace American late-night television. But she's far from a household name, more likely to be your favorite artist's favorite artist. Whatever the case, her fourth album is a testament to her greatness. \u201cNight Reign\u201d combines cultures and genres for a gorgeous matrimony.",
      "Those who declare there are no rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands anymore aren\u2019t listening closely enough. Enter Austin weirdos Being Dead, whose sophomore album \u201cEels\u201d is an asymmetrical collection of egg punk, Devo-worship, a recording of a bus driver who has had enough, psychedelic harmonies and various other oddball sensibilities that make them the best college radio rock band in recent history. And if that isn\u2019t enough to convince a nonbeliever, the proof is in the pudding \u2014 or in this case, the producer: Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Tegan and Sara) took the reins on the 16-track collection. And his co-sign means something.",
      "Detroit rapper Boldy James often works by finding a single \u2014 and singular \u2014 producer with whom he works closely for an album of distinction. This year, he\u2019s found a partner in Kansas City producer Conductor Williams for \u201cAcross the Tracks,\u201d a dreamy, loop-heavy record of rap excellence. It\u2019s right there from the jump. Intro \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d is stuffed with vintage, soulful sensibilities and undeniable bars. \u201cWas taught to always be the message I bring / Pulled the sword from the stone,\u201d he delivers in his cool monotone. \u201cCould never compete / They know the flow is rather unique (blocks) / I kept the receipts.\u201d",
      "In a time where celebrity musicians strive to appear like they avoid categorization, Guatemala-born, Mexico City-based cellist Mabe Fratti lives it. Her album, \u201cSentir Que No Sabes\u201d (\u201cFeel Like You Don\u2019t Know\u201d), thrives in the uncertainty of its title. Her inventive compositions contort her chosen instrument, as well as horns and drums and pianos, into something resembling free-form jazz. Or is it post-punk pop? Experimental electro-folk? These are never quite dissonant compositions, but they are unusual, askew. Language loses out here, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing.",
      "It is a failure of imagination that \u201cbest of\u201d music lists often fail to account for metal and its subgenres, despite consistently being one of the most popular musical forms the world over. But sometimes a metal album is too grand to ignore. That is the case with American death metal band Blood Incantation, whose fourth studio album \u201cAbsolute Elsewhere\u201d stunned even the genre's most transitory listeners for its prog rock spirit, synth detouring, playful kraut teases, hardened blast beats and throat-ripping vocals. It\u2019s cinematic.",
      "There's something in the water in Denmark. In 2024, some of the most exciting singer-songwriters hailed from the Scandinavian country: ML Buch and Clarissa Connelly, as well as de Casier. But it\u2019s the folk and classical songs of Astrid Sonne\u2019s \u201cGreat Doubt\u201d that truly struck a chord with us. It answers the question: What would a classically trained composer making experimental, haunted pop music with detuned pianos and woodwinds and flutes and brass actually sound like? Great, it turns out.",
      "The emergence of Cindy Lee has been described as the result of \u201canti-hype,\u201d an Internet neologism that doesn't mean much more than \u201climited publicity inspired intrigue.\u201d Lee \u2014 the drag alter ego of Women\u2019s Patrick Flegel, a fixture of Canadian indie rock since the early 2010s \u2014 originally released this lo-fi gem as an unmarked YouTube link. \u201cDiamond Jubilee\u201d resonated with avid, curious listeners \u2014 the kind undeterred by the fact that listening to this album, at one point in time, meant sitting down with all two hours and 32 minutes of it. But it\u2019s Lee\u2019s ambitious and expansive psych and garage rock that kept them coming back."

      "Quite a few, at least, if you're Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Off and on for some six years, Chalamet has been obsessively working toward his performance in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d He has visited Dylan's childhood home, learned how to play the guitar (and the harmonica) and immersed himself in the early \u201860s New York that Dylan emerged out of \u2014 even if much of it has faded with history by now.",
      "\u201cCafe Wha? was funny because they have Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan painted along the staircase and everything but now it\u2019s just, like, Aerosmith covers,\u201d Chalamet says, chuckling. \u201cI was like: I don\u2019t think this is what it was like when Bob was here.\u201d",
      "Chalamet has been building his Bob Dylan for so long that he's been seen playing Dylan songs while in costume as Willy Wonka and on the set of \u201cDune.\u201d His \u201cDune\u201d co-star, Oscar Isaac (who famously played a fictional Dylan-adjacent folk musician in \u201cInside Llewyn Davis\"), said, \u201dMy first thought, it sounded like a really bad idea.\"",
      "Isaac certainly wasn't the only one to doubt whether Chalamet, or anyone, could tackle someone as iconic and enigmatic as Dylan. But Chalamet's performance \u2014 complete with singing and guitar playing \u2014 in the James Mangold-directed film, which opens in theaters Dec. 25, has drawn near-universal praise. Chalamet has been nominated for a Golden Globe; if he were to be nominated and win at the Academy Awards, the 28-year-old would be the youngest best actor winner ever.",
      "Even Dylan, who gave Mangold notes on the film, has said: \u201cTimmy\u2019s a brilliant actor so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me.\u201d",

Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night That Split the Sixties,\u201d is a young, just-starting-out Dylan. By the end of the film, which culminates in the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, he's gone from folk messiah to Judas.",
      "Chalamet recently spoke to The Associated Press about how he navigated the biggest acting challenge of his career.",
      "CHALAMET: I like how you framed the question initially, that it\u2019s an undertaking. Bob Dylan is not only someone whose behaviorism and whose presence as a cultural figure is iconic, but, more importantly, as a thinker, as an artist, as a shaper of American culture through the last 60, 70 years, he's The Guy in a lot of ways. I obviously felt like you can\u2019t go near that if you\u2019re not ready to do it. Equally, I had five years to work on this, or six, so there was no truncated process at any point. If you play any real-life figure, it\u2019s sort of a gift. There\u2019s the reality of how it happened. But with a musician, your education becomes twofold, or tenfold, because there\u2019s not only the record of what he went through in his work, but the feeling he can give you as a person \u2014 which for me, with Bob\u2019s music, was exponential. It was indescribable \u2014 like many people, maybe yourself. And I wouldn\u2019t even try to describe it because he wouldn\u2019t.",
      "CHALAMET: Weirdly, it was the press conferences. This came to me in an email in 2018. Bob Dylan, to me, was limited to the good friend of my father\u2019s in New York, growing up, who had a striking black-and-white portrait of Dylan on his apartment wall. I didn\u2019t know much of his music. You know, stuff like \u201cBlowing in the Wind\u201d or \u201cTime\u2019s They Are a-Changin'\u201d are so enwoven in American culture that, of course, I knew those.",
      "I just went up YouTube and before songs popped up, the San Francisco press conference popped up in \u201965. I was just so fascinated to see an artist who was a definitive figure of the \u201960s, but who clearly was as much a thinker as he was a forward-facing entertainer. It\u2019s really, really rare to find the people that are deep thinkers and lyricists and artists that as much forward-facing entertainers. So when these artists pop up, like Bob Dylan, or I think in today\u2019s culture, Frank Ocean, we all have a responsibility to champion these artists. Usually, the sensitive nature or whatever you want to call it, would encourage someone with a deep brain like that to not put themselves out there like that \u2014 that\u2019s my theory.",
      "CHALAMET: It was really D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back.\u201d That was a Bible to me on this. I love, love, love that film. I love music documentaries. There\u2019s a Lil\u2019 Wayne documentary called \u201cThe Carter\u201d that\u2019s all these moments. It\u2019s just so special when you can get your camera on these music artists when they\u2019re at a moment like Bob was in \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back.\u201d Lil\u2019 Wayne in \u201cThe Carter\u201d is the same thing where they\u2019re learning to turn their back in some way, but they haven\u2019t done it yet.",
      "CHALAMET: The great thing about \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back\u201d is it\u2019s just really raw. There aren\u2019t the talking heads. It\u2019s what\u2019s great about Suze Rotolo's book. It\u2019s really raw. It\u2019s more raw than a lot of the other books about Bob Dylan. It\u2019s very clear-sighted about the young relationship she had with Bob. With an artist of such reverence, it\u2019s important as an actor not to simply revere him. Then you\u2019ll do justice to the people that already revere him, but to everyone else in the room, they won\u2019t get it.",
      "CHALAMET: I picked up a guitar on \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d because I pluck out the chords of a song in that film. So I had, like, a really rudimental experience with that. I think sometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID. I think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.",
      "CHALAMET: All of it. I really liked all of it. I like the more intimate songs like \u201cGirl From the North Country\u201d or \u201cBoots of Spanish Leather\u201d or \u201cOne Too Many Mornings\u201d or \u201cTomorrow Is a Long Time.\u201d But then I also liked \u201cNorth Country Blues\u201d and \u201cRocks and Gravel\u201d or \u201cBallad of Hollis Brown\u201d \u2014 things where you hear the iron ore in Bob\u2019s voice, the North Country in Minnesota, the Hibbing. The Hibbing that when I visited you really felt like you were on the edge of America, like the edge of the world. These factories that are covered in snow and the icy roads. That stuff, as a New Yorker, I just started to fall in love with.",
      "CHALAMET: Yeah, absolutely, in ways that are more unspoken than I could be definitive about. I just do. I don\u2019t know how to use more words than that. And it was empowering to play someone that really just bucked off all pressure.",
      "CHALAMET: That is a young man saying: Why are the older people in this room the signifiers and those who determine who the young lights forward are? Maybe the way he said it \u2014 talking about hair loss for older people being representative of their old age (laughs) \u2014 wasn\u2019t the nicest way of putting it. But what he was saying, it has an element of truth. And at a time when media was more centralized or something, I think his attitude toward it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to speak for him.",
      "CHALAMET: I think I\u2019d just say thank you, really. Not thank you for the opportunity to meet, or thank you for the opportunity to play the role. Thank you for his music and his art and his work.",
      "CHALAMET: I spent time in Duluth and Hibbing and Wisconsin and Chicago. I tried to retrace those steps leading to New York where he arrived in the early \u201960s. That wasn\u2019t some academy process. That wasn\u2019t trying to excavate the exact footprint and see if there was some DNA remaining and what that meant about where he was psychologically at the time. That was simply to be in the energy of these places and quell some insecurity I had about growing up in midtown Manhattan in the 2000s and how that would be different from growing up in iron ore country in the \u201950s and \u201960s.",
      "Granted, that\u2019s a different place than it was 60, 70 years ago \u2014 which was also moving to me, honestly. The unspoken metaphor I was feeling was: The world goes on. The times they are a\u2019changing and things have changed. Being a brilliant poet or artist like Bob is isn\u2019t the remedy for everyone.",
      "I also have this personal affinity for these artists that come from the Midwest of the United State. Kid Cudi is obviously a hip-hop artist I\u2019m hugely admiring of who came from Cleveland. It\u2019s beyond me. Because I had a hard enough time getting my career going being from New York. When I got to Hibbing, you think of this hero\u2019s journey of this young man.",
      "CHALAMET: I feel changed by the experience. I can\u2019t speak about the actual film. The process of it, the yearslong endeavor into it, the dignity in playing something that actually happened. Those were new facets to my experience as an artist. Beyond that, people will make of it what they will, which is totally fair. I think that\u2019s a great Bob worldview, too. Do with it what you want."

      "A British immigration tribunal upheld the decision on Thursday in a ruling that revealed the Chinese national had developed such a close relationship with Andrew that he was invited to the prince\u2019s birthday party.",
      "Government officials were concerned the man could have misused his influence because the prince was under \u201cconsiderable pressure\u201d at the time, according to the ruling.",

In 2022, Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, warned politicians that a British-Chinese lawyer had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China.",

Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022.

      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",

If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",

      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

    "story": [
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.",
      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "Purdue paid McKinsey more than $93 million over 15 years for several products, including how to improve revenue from OxyContin. Prosecutors say McKinsey \u201cknew the risk and dangers\u201d of OxyContin and knew that Purdue Pharma executives had previously pleaded guilty to crimes related to the promotion of the drug, but decided to work with the opioid manufacturer anyway.",
      "One of the jobs for McKinsey, the papers said, was to identify which prescribers would generate the most additional prescriptions if Purdue salespeople focused on that. That resulted in prescriptions that \u201cwere not for a medically accepted indication, were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d the filing said.",
      "\u201cThis was not hypothetical,\" Christopher Kavanaugh, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said in a news conference in Boston on Friday. \u201cThis was not just marketing. It was a strategy. It was executed and it worked.\u201d",
      "During work to \u201cturbocharge\u201d Purdue sales in 2013 after a drop in business, McKinsey consultants accompanied Purdue sales representatives on visits to prescribers and pharmacies to gather information. In a note about one ride-along, a McKinsey consultant said one pharmacist had a gun \u201cand was shaking; abuse is definitely a huge issue.\u201d The company continued looking for ways to increase OxyContin sales, according to court papers.",
      "In 2014, McKinsey identified some small clinics that were writing more opioid prescriptions than entire hospital systems \u2014 and suggested they be targeted for more sales, the court filing said.",
      "The company also tried to help Purdue get a say in shaping federal rules intended to ensure the benefits of addictive prescription drugs outweighed the risks. The government said in its new filings that that resulted in making high-dose OxyContin subject to the same oversight as lower-dose opioids and made training for prescribers voluntary rather than mandatory.",
      "Since 2021, McKinsey has agreed to pay state and local governments about $765 million in settlements for its role in advising businesses on how to sell more of the powerful prescription painkillers amid a national opioid crisis.",
      "The firm also agreed last year to pay health care funds and insurance companies $78 million.",
      "Federal authorities say the deal represents the first time a management consulting firm is being held accountable like this for advising a client to break the law.",
      "\u201cIf a consulting first conspires with a client to engage in criminal conduct, the fact that you\u2019re an outside consultant will not protect you,\u201d said Joshua Levy, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts.",
      "Some advocates say the opioid crisis was touched off when Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin hit the market in 1996.",
      "Three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to misbranding charges in 2007 and the company agreed to pay a fine. The company pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2020 and agreed to $8.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures \u2014 most of which will be waived as long as it executes a settlement through bankruptcy court that is still in the works.",

      "Specially trained miniature horses visit hospital wards and residential care homes in the Greek capital, providing pet therapy to sick and disabled children and adults",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of nine tiny equines from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the horses, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of nine equines \u2014 the six American miniature horses, one that was later born in Greece, and two rescued ponies - Billy the Shetland pony and Giselle who was rescued from the island of Santorini.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",
      "Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. \u201cI\u2019m making super-human efforts,\u201d said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program\u2019s continuity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",
      "Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can.",
      "During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the reactions. It\u2019s like something awakens their senses,\u201d said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki.",
      "The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, \u201cis very important for us. Especially when it\u2019s spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn\u2019t instigated by us,\u201d Volikaki said.",
      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the (horses) get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",
      "His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.",
      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",
      "He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month backpacking trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found \u201cthe perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.\u201d",
      "In late April, he advised another Reddit user with a back problem to \u201ckeep trying different surgeons\u201d and, if necessary, convey an inability to keep working.",
      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",

So that\u2019s possibly why he targeted that company,\u201d said Kenny.",
      "UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer.",
      "Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald's in the city of Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City.

      "Mangione's arrest came five days after the caught-on-camera killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel, where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing on a bicycle through Central Park.",
      "Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so that he can face a murder charge in Thompson's killing. A hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 30.",
      "The 26-year-old, who police say was found with a \u201c ghost gun \u201d matching shell casings found at the site of the shooting, is charged in Pennsylvania with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was on the verge of backing a 16-week federal abortion ban earlier this year when aides staged an intervention.",
      "According to Time magazine's cover story on his selection as its 2024 Person of the Year, Trump's aides first raised concerns in mid-March that the abortion cutoff being pushed by some allies would be stricter than existing law in numerous states. It was seen as a potential political liability amid ongoing fallout over the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that includes three justices nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "Trump political director James Blair went to work assembling a slide deck \u2014 eventually titled \u201cHow a national abortion ban will cost Trump the election\" \u2014 that argued a 16-week ban would hurt the Republican candidate in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the magazine reported.",
      "\u201cAfter flipping through Blair\u2019s presentation\" on a flight to a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in April, Trump dropped the idea, according to the report. \"So we leave it to the states, right?\" Trump was quoted as saying. He soon released a video articulating that position.",
      "At the time, Trump\u2019s campaign denied that he was considering supporting the 16-week ban, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and saying Trump planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House.",
      "Here are other highlights from the story and the president-elect's 65-minute interview with the magazine:",

The panel is supposed to find waste and cut regulations, including many that could affect Musk's wide-ranging interests, which include electric cars, rockets and telecommunications.",

I can\u2019t imagine, but with, you know, we\u2019re looking at everything, but highly unlikely. I guess I could say probably as close to ruling it out as possible, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to do anything now.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would abandon Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia's invasion, Trump said he would use U.S. support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow in negotiating an end to the war.",

    "story": [
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid specific surgeries, according to two studies exploring ways to lessen treatment burdens.",
      "One new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines whether removing lymph nodes is always necessary in early breast cancer. Another in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a new approach to a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.",
      "The research was discussed Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.",
      "Every year, about 50,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, where the cells that line milk ducts become cancerous, but the nearby breast tissue remains healthy. Many choose to have surgery, although it\u2019s unclear whether they could instead take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with more frequent monitoring.",
      "The new study, based on two years of data, suggests that such active monitoring is a safe alternative to surgery for many of these women, though some doctors will want to see if the results hold up over time.",
      "\u201cThis is an option that patients should consider for their DCIS,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor a long time, we\u2019ve had the feeling that we\u2019re overtreating some patients with DCIS. This is a confirmation of what we suspected is happening.\u201d",
      "Taking a more cautious view, Dr. Monica Morrow of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, said a two-year study isn't long enough to draw conclusions.",
      "The finding is based on following more than 950 U.S. patients randomly assigned to surgery or active monitoring. All had low-risk DCIS with no sign of invasive cancer. They had the type of DCIS that responds to hormone-blocking drugs and many in the study took those drugs as part of their treatment.",
      "After two years, the rates of invasive cancer were low and did not differ significantly between the groups, with about 6% in the surgery group and about 4% in the monitoring group diagnosed with invasive cancer.",
      "Among patients in the monitoring group, changes spotted on a mammogram would prompt a biopsy. They also could opt for surgery at any time for any reason.",
      "Some study participants didn\u2019t stick with the treatment they were randomly assigned. So in a separate analysis looking at those who actually had surgery or not, the rates of invasive cancer were about 9% for the surgery group and 3% for the monitoring group.",
      "The researchers will continue to follow the patients to see if the finding holds up over a decade.",
      "Tina Clark, 63, of Buxton, Maine, joined the study after being diagnosed with DCIS in 2019. Randomly assigned to the monitoring-only group, she was able to avoid surgery and radiation during a time when she was raising a teenage nephew and going through the illness and death of her husband.",
      "\u201cI feel just so grateful and fortunate that I found this study when I did,\u201d Clark said.",
      "She has mammograms every six months to keep watch on the DCIS in her right breast, which has not advanced. The mammograms spotted a small cancer in her other breast in 2023, unrelated to the DCIS. She had a lumpectomy to remove it.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re diagnosed with low-risk DCIS, you have time to understand more about your disease and understand what your options are,\u201d said study author Dr. Shelley Hwang of Duke University School of Medicine.",
      "Women having surgery for breast cancer often also have what\u2019s called a sentinel lymph node biopsy where a few lymph nodes in the armpit are removed to check for spreading cancer.",
      "But removing lymph nodes can cause lasting pain and arm swelling, so research is underway to determine when it can be avoided. A study in Europe last year showed that older women with small tumors could safely avoid the added surgery.",
      "In the new study, researchers in Germany looked at whether women with early breast cancer who were planning to have breast-conserving surgery could safely skip having lymph nodes removed. They followed 4,858 women who were randomly assigned to have lymph nodes removed or not.",
      "After five years, about 92% of women in both groups were still alive and free of cancer.",
      "\u201cRemoving lymph nodes does not improve survival, and the risk of cancer coming back in the armpit is quite low when lymph nodes are not removed,\u201d said Morrow, who added that some women will still need the lymph node procedure to help determine which treatment drugs they should take after surgery.",

      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",

      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",
      "Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria.",

      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compare the years 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens hitting 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from nearly 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared with the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

    "story": [
      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes says she is suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness over what she calls \u201cexcessive pumping\u201d of groundwater",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county.",
      "The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mayes told reporters Wednesday that the Arizona Legislature has done nothing to fix the groundwater problem despite knowing about the problem for years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws regulating groundwater pumping could have prevented this situation, the legislature\u2019s inaction has allowed the crisis to grow,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cWhen the legislature fails to protect our most basic resources, the attorney general must step in.\u201d",
      "La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin, a Republican, commended Mayes, a Democrat, for attempting to address what she described as her community\u2019s \u201cmost challenging\u201d concern.",
      "\u201cI know that my constituents will be thrilled over this, that somebody is actually paying attention to the real problems here,\u201d Irwin said during Wednesday\u2019s news briefing via a video conference call.",
      "Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use, or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community.",
      "Mayes called the company\u2019s groundwater pumping \u201cunsustainable\u201d and said it caused \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for people in the area.",
      "\u201cArizona law is clear: no company has the right to endanger an entire community\u2019s health and safety for its own gain,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater pumping it says is \u201cexcessive\u201d and require that an abatement fund be established to cover the costs of damages caused by the company.",
      "Mayes said the dollar figure hasn't been determined but it will be established through the course of litigation.",
      "Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona.

      "President Joe Biden says having healthy women is as important for the U.S. economy as it is for the women themselves",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he is \u201cso proud\u201d that a women's health research initiative he launched last year at his wife's urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity.",
      "\u201cThat's a fact,\u201d he said in closing remarks at the first White House Conference on Women's Health Research. \u201cWe haven't gotten that through to the other team yet,\" Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration.",
      "Trump's three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his first term as president voted to overturn a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women's health issues in this year's elections.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect will keep his promise to improve health in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise,\" Leavitt said in an email.",
      "Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied, officials have said.",
      "Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to the president after Maria Shriver, herself a women's health advocate and member of the influential Kennedy political family, brought it to her.",
      "The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she will keep pressing the issue after she leaves her role.",
      "\u201cMy work doesn't stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,\u201d she said. \u201cI will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative research.\u201d",
      "The first lady said the U.S. economy loses about $1.8 billion in working time every year because of how menopause affects women. And she is interested in learning more about extreme morning sickness during pregnancy.",
      "\u201cI heard this a couple weeks ago and I was particularly interested because my own granddaughter was going through the same thing, 'cause we're going to be great-grandparents,\u201d Jill Biden said.",
      "Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal and her husband, Peter Neal, are expecting their first child.",
      "Since its launch, the women's health research initiative has attracted nearly $1 billion in federal funding, including from the Defense Department and National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cIn one year, everybody in this room kicked butt,\u201d Shriver said at the conference. \u201cNot until the Bidens did anyone ever think to make women's health and research a priority for the federal government, so let that sink in.\u201d",
      "President Biden closed the conference with a nod to the influence of his wife, who, after her remarks, sat in the front row beside their daughter Ashley Biden, who runs a women's shelter in Philadelphia.",
      "\u2018You stepped up kid,\" Biden told the first lady. Then he told the audience, \u201cIn case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:58:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
    "story": [
      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited a program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",

He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music.",
      "Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.",
      "The son of legendary tabla artist Ustad Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he began performing alongside India\u2019s classical music legends during his teens.",
      "In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band \u201cShakti\u201d with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences.",
      "In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year.",
      "Hussain\u2019s \u201cShakti\u201d won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, B\u00e9la Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009.",
      "In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India\u2019s second-highest civilian award.",
      "Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters."

      "David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalized, told Sky News Australia on Monday that his relatives had been cleared for discharge.",
      "Local news outlets reported on Sunday that the cause of the foreigners' illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos in November in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming tainted drinks.",
      "But Tudravu said no cause had been identified in the Fiji episode. Police have ordered toxicology tests and are awaiting results, he added.",
      "Gavoka said no other reports of similar illness were recorded at the resort or across Fiji, a South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said.

      "YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia -- A Filipino woman who was on death row in Indonesia \u2014 and was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015 \u2014 was moved late Sunday to a female prison in Indonesia\u2019s capital, from where she will be flown back to her home country.",
      "Mary Jane Veloso, who spent almost 15 years in an Indonesian prison for drug trafficking, was allowed to return home after Indonesia and the Philippines signed a \u201cpractical arrangement\u201d deal on Dec. 6, after a decade of pleading from Manila.",

      "Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death.",

      "Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to dismiss Yoon or restore his power.",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree as the Constitutional Court began its first meeting Monday on Yoon\u2019s case to determine whether to remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defense Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon\u2019s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion.",
      "Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear.",
      "Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon\u2019s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties.",
      "Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his Dec. 3 martial law decree. His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.",
      "Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as \u201canti-state forces\u201d bogging down his agendas and vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against efforts to remove him from office.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of protesters have poured onto the streets of the country\u2019s capital, Seoul, in recent days, calling for Yoon\u2019s ouster and arrest.",
      "It remains unclear whether Yoon will grant the request by investigators for an interview. South Korean prosecutors, who are pushing a separate investigation into the incident, also reportedly asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. Repeated calls to a prosecutors\u2019 office in Seoul were unanswered.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential security service has also resisted a police attempt to search Yoon's office for evidence.",
      "The request came before the Constitutional Court met Monday to discuss the case. The court has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster.",
      "In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents \u2014 Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 \u2014 the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became the country\u2019s acting leader after Yoon's impeachment, and other government officials have sought to reassure allies and markets after Yoon\u2019s surprise stunt paralyzed politics, halted high-level diplomacy and complicated efforts to revive a faltering economy.",
      "Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon\u2019s impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament.",
      "Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who drove a political offensive against Yoon\u2019s government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, separately criticized Lee\u2019s proposal for the special council, saying that it\u2019s \u201cnot right\u201d for the opposition party to act like the ruling party.",
      "Yoon\u2019s impeachment, which was endorsed in parliament by some of his ruling People Power Party lawmakers, has created a deep rift within the party between Yoon\u2019s loyalists and his opponents. On Monday, PPP chair Han Dong-hun, a strong critic of Yoon's martial law, announced his resignation.",
      "\u201cIf martial law had not been lifted that night, a bloody incident could have erupted that morning between the citizens who would have taken to the streets and our young soldiers,\u201d Han told a news conference.",
      "Yoon\u2019s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders the country has not seen since the 1980s. Yoon was forced to lift his decree hours later after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.",
      "Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon\u2019s decree. No major violence occurred.",
      "Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament\u2019s operations even in those cases.",

      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- West Africa\u2019s regional bloc ECOWAS approved Sunday an exit timeline for three coup-hit nations after a nearly yearlong process of mediation to avert the unprecedented disintegration of the grouping.",
      "In a first in the 15-nation bloc\u2019s nearly 50 years of existence, the military juntas of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso announced in January that they decided to leave ECOWAS, accusing it of \u201cinhumane and irresponsible\u201d coup-related sanctions and of failing to help them solve their internal security crises.",
      "\u201cThe authority decides to set the period from 29 January, 2025 to 29 July 2025 as a transitional period and to keep ECOWAS doors open to the three countries during the transition period,\u201d ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray said in his closing remarks Sunday at the summit of regional heads of state in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.",
      "The three coup-hit countries have largely rebuffed ECOWAS\u2019 efforts to reverse their withdrawal. They have started to consider how to issue travel documents separately from ECOWAS and are forming their own alliance. The one-year notice for their departure is expected to be completed in January.",
      "Touray commended efforts by the bloc's envoys to resolve the crisis. \u201cThese efforts underscore your collective commitment to preserving peace and unity in our region,\u201d he said.",
      "Bola Tinubu, the president of Nigeria and chairman of ECOWAS, said the challenges faced around the world and in the region test its ability to work together. \u201cWe must not lose sight of our fundamental responsibility, which is to protect our citizens and create an enabling environment where they can prosper,\u201d he said.",
      "One major benefit of being a member of ECOWAS is visa-free movement to member states, and it is not clear how that could change after the three countries leave the bloc. Asked about such an implication in July, the ECOWAS commission president said: \u201cWhen you get out of an agreement ... if it is about free trade, free movement of people, the risk of losing those concessions remains.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the three countries said in a joint statement that while access to their territories would remain visa-free for other West African citizens, they \u201creserve the right \u2026 to refuse entry to any ECOWAS national falling into the category of inadmissible immigrants.\u201d",
      "As West Africa's top political authority since it was formed in 1975, such a division is ECOWAS' biggest challenge since inception, said Babacar Ndiaye, senior fellow with the Senegal-based Timbuktu Institute for Peace Studies.",
      "The chances of ECOWAS getting the three countries back into their fold are slim mostly because the bloc wants a quick return to democracy, which the juntas have not committed to, said Mucahid Durmaz, a senior analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. Allowing the juntas to remain in power \u201ccould risk further regional fragmentation\u201d while recognizing them as legitimate authorities would represent \u201ca serious departure from ECOWAS\u2019s founding principles,\u201d Durmaz said.",
      "The regional bloc also failed to manage the situation in the best possible way, he said.",
      "\u201cThe bloc\u2019s inconsistent responses to coups in the region have given an impression that its stance is influenced more by the political ambitions of member states than by its founding principles of promoting democratic governance,\u201d Durmaz said.",

      "\u201cWhat is it with the Assad family and being photographed in their underwear? Highly interested in knowing the fantasy behind,\u201d journalist Hussam Hammoud wrote on X.",
      "In the photos, Syrians can see the ophthalmologist in Assad and not the leader. In one, he's on a balcony teasing a girl sitting on his shoulders. In another, a young Assad places a ring on his wife's finger. In a third, he's seemingly taking a selfie.",
      "Social media footage also has shown Syrians touring the Assads' opulent estates, revealing extravagant decor and possessions out of reach for many who lived through the country's civil war since 2011. Assad\u2019s wife, once featured in Vogue, epitomized the sophistication and luxury, and Syrians have uncovered jewelry boxes and designer goods.",
      "Fueled by decades of persecution and a desire for vengeance, people have stripped the mansions of valuables and further exposed Assad\u2019s private world.",

      "MOSCOW -- Two Russian oil tankers have been seriously damaged following a storm in the Kerch Strait, spilling oil and sparking an emergency rescue operation, Russian officials told state news outlets Sunday.",
      "Some reports said at least one of the vessels later sank.",
      "The Volgoneft-212 tanker, which was carrying a crew of 13 and a cargo of fuel oil, ran aground and had its bow torn away, the Tass news agency reported, citing the country\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry. Officials said that one crew member died, but that a rescue operation was able to evacuate the remaining sailors.",
      "A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also damaged and was adrift with 14 crewmembers on board. It later ran aground 80 meters from shore close to the port of Taman in Russia's Krasnodar region, where a rescue operation is being planned, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.",
      "Together, the two ships were carrying almost 9,000 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-grade fuel oil, Tass reported. Social media footage from the scene showed a black slick of liquid among the waves.",
      "Russian officials confirmed the oil spill, but said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent.",
      "The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.",
      "It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to illegally seize control of the area. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months."

      "\u201cThey are promising us that government will be formed soon and, God willing, things will become better because we got rid of the tyrant,\u201d said one worshiper, Jihad Raffoul, as the small Christian population hoped that new messages of inclusion would ring true.",
      "\u201cToday, our prayers are for a new page in Syria\u2019s future,\u201d said another, Suzan Barakat.",

      "\u201cGod willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country,\u201d said school director Maysoun Al-Ali.",
      "But other challenges complicate rebuilding. The new leadership has not laid out a clear vision of how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive remains designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which nevertheless has begun making direct contact.",

Israel also has sent in ground troops, calling the incursion temporary but signaling the presence is open-ended.",

      "Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it, though the international community except for the U.S. regards it as occupied. Israeli figures show the remote territory is home to about 50,000 people, about half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians.",

    "summary": "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is &ldquo;several hundred&rdquo; and may run into the thousands",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \u201cseveral hundred\u201d and may run into the thousands",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \u201cseveral hundred\u201d and may run into the thousands, the island\u2019s top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday.",
      "France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction.",
      "\u201cI think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we\u2019ll get close to a thousand. Even thousands ... given the violence of this event,\u2033 Mayotte Prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere.",
      "He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years.",
      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa is France\u2019s poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \u2033this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\u201d he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone\u2019s path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \u201cthoughts\u201d were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \u201cwill be high,\u201d while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \u201chelp the population and prevent potential looting.\u201d",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\u201cMayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\u201d he said.",
      "Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding.",
      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

      "The fighting in the coastal city of Zawiya, about 47 kilometers (about 30 miles) west of capital Tripoli, pitted gunmen loyal to the Shurafaa tribe against warlord Mohamed Kushlaf, according to local media. Kushalf was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council in 2018 for his alleged involvement in human trafficking.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what triggered the clashes but they are not uncommon in western Libya, which is controlled by an array of lawless militias and armed groups allied with Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah\u2019s government.",
      "Oil-rich Libya has been divided for years between rival administrations in the east and west. It plunged into chaos following the 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, which toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Amid the chaos, militias grew in wealth and power, particularly in Tripoli and the western part of the country.",
      "The fighting Sunday closed a major coastal road linking Zawiya to other cities in western Libya and classes were suspended.",
      "\u201cMany families are trapped in their homes. Bullets are being fired indiscriminately, hitting houses and buildings,\u201d resident Ahmed Abu Hussein said by phone. He said the the fighting occurred in multiple areas across the city, including densely populated quarters, causing panic and terror among civilians.",
      "The clashes also caused \u201csevere damage\u201d to storage tanks in the Zawiya oil refinery, the Libyan National Oil Corp. said.",
      "Bullets hit oil tanks, leading to \u201cdangerous\u201d fires, it said, adding that firefighters managed to control the fires and gas leakage as clashes raged around the refinery.",
      "The company, which runs Libya\u2019s oil industry, declared emergency and force majeure, a legal maneuver that releases it of its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.",
      "In August, clashes between two heavily armed militias in Tripoli killed at least nine people and wounded 16 others.",
      "Libya is currently governed by Dbeibah\u2019s government in Tripoli and by the administration of Prime Minister Ossama Hammad in the east, which is allied with forces of powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter."

Holiday songs played in the background and there were apple snacks and juice for all.",

      "ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E",
      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "The settlement agreement was signed Friday, the same day a Florida federal judge ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for separate depositions in the case next week. The settlement means that sworn testimony is no longer required.",
      "The agreement bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia, Serbia\u2019s president said Saturday.",
      "President Aleksandar Vucic told state RTS broadcaster that Serbia has been officially informed that the decision on sanctions will come into force on Jan. 1 but that he has so far not received any related documents from the U.S.",
      "There has been no comment from U.S. officials.",
      "Serbia almost entirely depends on Russian gas, which it receives through pipelines in neighboring states. The gas is then distributed by Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft.",
      "Vucic said that after receiving the official documents, \u201cwe will talk to the Americans first, then we go talk to the Russians\u201d to try to reverse the decision. \u201cAt the same time, we will try to preserve our friendly relations with the Russians and not to spoil relations with those who impose sanctions,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Mie Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master Japanese sake brewers",
      "OKAYA, Japan -- Not long after dawn, Japanese sake brewer Mie Takahashi checks the temperature of the mixture fermenting at her family\u2019s 150-year-old sake brewery, Koten, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps.",
      "She stands on an uneven narrow wooden platform over a massive tank containing more than 3,000 liters (800 gallons) of a bubbling soup of steamed rice, water and a rice mold known as koji, and gives it a good mix with a long paddle.",
      "\u201cThe morning hours are crucial in sake making,\u201d said Takahashi, 43. Her brewery is in Nagano prefecture, a region known for its sake making.",
      "Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master sake brewers. Only 33 female toji are registered in Japan\u2019s Toji Guild Association out of more than a thousand breweries nationwide.",
      "That\u2019s more than several decades ago. Women were largely excluded from sake production until after World War II.",
      "Sake making has a history of more than a thousand years, with strong roots in Japan's traditional Shinto religion.",
      "But when the liquor began to be mass produced during the Edo period, from 1603 until 1868, an unspoken rule barred women from breweries.",
      "The reasons behind the ban remain obscure. One theory is that women were considered impure because of menstruation and were therefore excluded from sacred spaces, said Yasuyuki Kishi, vice director of the Sakeology Center at Niigata University.",
      "\u201cAnother theory is that as sake became mass produced, a lot of heavy labor and dangerous tasks were involved,\" he said. \"So the job was seen as inappropriate for women.\u201d",
      "But the gradual breakdown of gender barriers, coupled with a shrinking workforce caused by Japan's fast-aging population, has created space for more women to work in sake production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still mostly a male-dominated industry. But I think now people focus on whether someone has the passion to do it, regardless of gender,\u201d Takahashi said.",
      "She believes mechanization in the brewery is also helping to narrow the gender gap. At Koten, a crane lifts hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of steamed rice in batches and places it onto a cooling conveyor, after which the rice is sucked through a hose and transported to a separate room dedicated to cultivating koji.",
      "\u201cIn the past, all of this would have been done by hand,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cWith the help of machines, more tasks are accessible for women.\u201d",
      "Sake, or nihonshu, is made by fermenting steamed rice with koji mold, which converts starch into sugar. The ancient brewing technique was recognized under UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage earlier this month.",
      "As a child, Takahashi was not allowed to enter her family-owned brewery. But when she turned 15, she was given a tour of the brewery for the first time and was captivated by the fermentation process.",
      "\u201cI saw it bubbling up. It was fascinating to learn that those bubbles were the work of microorganisms that you can\u2019t even see,\u201d said Takahashi, who couldn't drink alcohol at the time because she was underage. \u201cIt smelled really good. I thought it was amazing that this wonderful fragrant sake could be made from just rice and water. So I thought I\u2019d like to try making it myself.\u201d",
      "She pursued a degree in fermentation science at the Tokyo University of Agriculture. After graduation, she decided to return home to become a master brewer. She trained for 10 years under the guidance of her predecessor, and at the age of 34 became a toji at her family brewery.",
      "As the brewery enters the winter peak season, Takahashi oversees a team of seasonal workers and production ramps up. It\u2019s labor-intensive work, hauling and turning large amounts of heavy steamed rice, and mixing thousands of liters (hundreds of gallons) of brew. The master brewer must have the knowledge and skill to carefully control optimal koji mold growth, which needs round-the-clock monitoring.",
      "Despite the intensity, Takahashi manages to encourage camaraderie in the brewery, catching up with the team as they hand-mix koji rice side by side in a hot humid room.",
      "\u201cI was taught that the most important thing is to get along with your team,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cA common saying is that if the atmosphere in the brewery is tense, the sake will turn out harsh, but if things are going well in the brewery, the sake will turn out smooth.\u201d",
      "The inclusion of women plays an important role in the survival of the Japanese sake industry, which has seen a steady decline since its peak in the 1970s.",
      "Domestic alcoholic consumption has dropped, while many smaller breweries struggle to find new master brewers. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, today\u2019s total production volume is about a quarter of what it was 50 years ago.",
      "To remain competitive, Koten is among many Japanese breweries trying to find a wider market both domestically and abroad.",
      "\u201cOur main product has always been dry sake, which local people continue to drink regularly,\" said Takahashi's older brother, Isao Takahashi, who is in charge of the business side of the family operation. \"We\u2019re now exploring making higher value sake as well.\u201d",
      "He supports his sister's experiments \u2013- every year she creates a limited-edition series, Mie Special, that's meant to branch out from their signature dry product.",
      "\u201cMy sister would say she wants to try to make low alcohol content, or she wants to try new yeasts -\u2013 all kinds of new techniques are coming in through her,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my sister to make the sake she wants, and I want to do my best to sell it.\u201d"

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Cook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.",
      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",
      "Trump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.",
      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt."

      "Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.",
      "The court rejected that request on Friday, calling it \u201cunwarranted.\"",
      "\u201cThe petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,\u201d said the court's order, which was unsigned.",
      "The statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing\u2019s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government\u2019s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.",
      "In the request filed this week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a \u201cmodest delay\u201d in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could \u201cdetermine its position\u201d on the matter.",
      "If the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "The Justice Department had opposed TikTok\u2019s request for a pause, saying in a court filing this week that the parties had already proposed a schedule that was \u201cdesigned for the precise purpose\u201d of allowing Supreme Court review of the law before it took effect.",
      "The appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said."

    "title": "'Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in the US, native ones are almost gone",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:12:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
    "story": [
      "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
      "It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct.",
      "But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal.",
      "\u201cYou can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,\u201d said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did.",
      "Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development.",
      "Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking.",
      "Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. \u201cIt was really a pretty significant species to lose,\u201d said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. \u201cThe more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.\u201d",
      "The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is \u2014 blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts.",
      "To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year.",
      "\u201cIt kind of stinks that it happened because now it\u2019s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,\" said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,\u201d Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance.",
      "Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world?",
      "A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbolic to say it\u2019s revolutionary\" for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country.",
      "Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it \u201crobust and well supported\u201d and \u201ccritically important to the success of the chestnut.\u201d",
      "Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. \u201cI think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?\"",
      "For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry.",
      "\u201cThe project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cI want to do something good for the future, for my children.\"",

      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different \u2014 and the star of \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d now has an award.",
      "Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award \u2014 and the glitzy festival itself \u2014 is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry.",
      "\u201cMy heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,\u201d Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. \u201cI used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.\u201d",
      "The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training.",
      "The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom\u2019s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world\u2019s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman \u201chas really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don\u2019t see the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens \u2014 by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.)",
      "The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring.",
      "\u201cThese facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,\u201d said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. \u201cToday, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, \u2018I cannot implement my imagination.\u2019\u201d",
      "The facilities are one part of the equation \u2014 the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues.",
      "In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in \u201cMandoob\u201d (\u201cNight Courier\u201d) and changing social norms in \u201cNaga.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that\u2019s what reaches the world,\u201d Elshehri says of the changing shift. \u201cWhen you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.\u201d",
      "But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society.",
      "As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold.",
      "\u201cWe certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. \u201cThe Goat Life,\u201d a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question.",
      "Even \u201cMy Driver and I,\u201d featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship.",
      "Now in 2024, the film is a success story \u2014 a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it.",
      "\u201cI see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,\u201d Dakheelallah said. \u201cWe need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

      "The Supreme Court says it will take up a business-backed appeal that could make it easier to challenge federal regulations, acting in a dispute related to California\u2019s nation-leading standards for vehicle emissions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday said it would take up a business-backed appeal that could make it easier to challenge federal regulations, acting in a dispute related to California's nation-leading standards for vehicle emissions.",
      "The justices agreed to hear an appeal filed by fuel producers who object to a waiver granted to California in 2022 by the Environmental Protection Agency during Joe Biden's presidency. The waiver allows California to set more stringent emissions limits than the national standard.",
      "The case won't be argued until the spring, when the Trump administration is certain to take a more industry-friendly approach to the issue. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal and repeal key parts of a landmark 2022 climate law.",
      "The high court will not be reviewing the waiver itself, but instead will look at a preliminary issue, whether fuel producers have legal standing to challenge the EPA waiver.",
      "The federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the companies lacked the right to sue because they produced no evidence that they would be affected by the waiver, which directly affects vehicle manufacturers.",
      "Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and other major automakers already are meeting the California emission standards, the administration noted in court papers.",
      "But the fuel producers told the high court that the appellate decision, if left in place, would \u201cimperil future challenges to administrative action.\u201d",
      "They said they met the legal test for getting into court. As a \u201cmatter of common sense,\u201d lawyers for the companies wrote, automakers would produce fewer electric vehicles and more gas-powered cars if the waiver were set aside, directly affecting how much fuel would be sold.",
      "The EPA waiver was part of the Biden administration's efforts to reverse environmental rollbacks from Trump's first White House term and restore California's authority to set tighter emissions rules.",
      "California has unique authority under the federal Clean Air Act to set tougher standards for cars sold in the nation's largest state, which has prompted automakers to produce more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less climate-damaging tailpipe exhaust.",
      "In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the fuel producers' case as well as a related challenge from Ohio and other Republican-led states and fuel producers. The appeals court hears many challenges to federal regulations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not act on the states' appeal.",
      "The current fight has its roots in a 2019 decision by the Trump administration to rescind the state\u2019s authority. Three years later, with Biden in office, the EPA restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "The EPA could decide as soon as next week on a separate request by California for a waiver allowing it to enforce a rule aimed at banning sales of new gasoline-powered cars in the state by 2035. The rule is stricter than a federal rule adopted this year that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "If the new waiver is granted as expected, it could be short-lived. The incoming Trump administration is likely to move to revoke all California waivers, although that effort could face legal challenges.",
      "An EPA spokesman said Friday that the agency \u201ccontinues to review California\u2019s waiver requests closely to make sure its decisions are durable and grounded in the law. We have no updates to share on timing.\u2019\u2019",
      "Other environmental regulations have not fared well before the conservative-majority court in recent years. In 2022, the justices limited the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a landmark decision. In June, the court halted the agency\u2019s air-pollution-fighting \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule.",
      "Another ruling in June, overturning a decades-old decision known colloquially as Chevron, is also expected to make environmental regulations more difficult to set and keep, along with other federal agency actions.",
      "But the justices also have recently kept in effect environmental regulations to limit planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants, while legal challenges play out.",

      "A pair of conservative groups are challenging a new Maine law that limits donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A pair of conservative groups on Friday challenged a Maine law that limits donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, arguing that money spent to support political expression is \"a vital feature of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the referendum overwhelmingly approved on Election Day fully expected a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs. They hoped the referendum would trigger a case and ultimately prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify the matter of donor limits after the court opened the floodgates to independent spending in its 2010 Citizens United decision.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Dinner Table Action and For Our Future, and supported by the Institute for Free Speech, contends the state law limiting individual super PAC donations to $5,000 and requiring disclosure of donor names runs afoul of that Citizens United legal precedent.",
      "\u201cAll Americans, not just those running for office, have a fundamental First Amendment right to talk about political campaigns,\u201d lawyers wrote in the lawsuit in federal court. \u201cTheir \u2018independent expenditures,\u2019 payments that fund political expression by those who are not running for office but nonetheless have something to say about a campaign, are a vital feature of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of the Maine Citizens to End Super PACs, which pressed for the referendum, said the lawsuit attempts to undermine the will of the people after an overwhelming majority \u2014 74% of voters \u2014 approved the referendum last month.",
      "\u201cSuper PACs are killing the country and in Maine we decided to do something about it. We want to restore public trust in the political process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to say that in Maine we are not resigned to the tide of big money. We are the tide.\u201d",
      "But Alex Titcomb, executive director of Dinner Table Action, argued Friday that the government \u201ccannot restrict independent political speech simply because some voters wish to limit the voices of their fellow citizens.\u201d",
      "Named in the lawsuit are Maine\u2019s attorney general and the state\u2019s campaign spending watchdog, the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices. The ethics commission is reviewing the complaint, said Jonathan Wayne, executive director.",
      "The Maine referendum didn\u2019t attempt to limit spending on behalf of candidates. Instead, it focused on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, contends the U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.",
      "Lessig, whose Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum, previously said the cap on donations imposed by the referendum \"is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d"

      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and prevent an artificial intelligence \"dictatorship\" is now heading to a federal judge as Musk seeks to halt the ChatGPT maker's ongoing shift into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",
      "The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk\u2019s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,\u201d says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk\u2019s foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk\u2019s requested order, saying it would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.",
      "Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would \u201cunequivocally have initial control of the company\u201d but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",
      "In the same email, titled \u201cHonest Thoughts,\u201d Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by \u201cpolitical goals.\u201d Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered \u201cOpen Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,\u201d a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the \u201cHonest Thoughts\u201d email that Musk described as the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,\u201d Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.",
      "Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.",
      "Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt \u201ctremendously sad\u201d but also characterized Musk\u2019s legal fight as one about business competition.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Altman said. He also said at the conference that he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence with President-elect Donald Trump.

      "With a late Thanksgiving, the holiday shopping season is five days shorter than last year, and owners of small retail shops say people have been quick to snap up holiday d\u00e9cor early, along with gifts for others and themselves.

Online shopping is expected to grow too. Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe, predicts an 8.4% increase online for the full season.",

Nathan Waldon, who owns Nathan & Co., with two gift shops in Oakland, California, said he had his best Black Friday ever, with sales up 32%. But business slowed dramatically after that.

      "\u201cIt could be they could buy the $25 item, but then they\u2019ll add on a little something extra,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that the sweet spot is between 40 and 50 bucks.\u201d",
      "Small businesses in some parts of the country are hoping holiday shopping helps them recover from extreme weather during the year. In Florida, Jennifer Johnson, owner of consignment shop True Fashionistas in Naples, Florida, had a slow summer season, partly because the area was hit by three hurricanes this year. She decided to increase her Black Friday weekend discount this year to draw in shoppers \u2013 offering a 25%-off deal rather than the 18% to 20% she normally offers.",

An unpredictable economy and tough competition on pricing from bigger chains were also obstacles during the year.",
      "During the Black Friday weekend, she offered 20% off for orders of $75 or more and 30% off orders of $150 and more. Last year she just offered discounts on select items, not blanket discounts.",
      "\u201cWe gave out our biggest incentive ever for shoppers to come out with discounts and promos. I certainly think that that was necessary this year,\u201d she said.",
      "Beltz\u2019 customers gravitated toward prices either under $20 or around $100. At her shops, Philadelphia Eagles and Taylor Swift merchandise were the top sellers, including $14 socks and $99 sweaters.",
      "\u201cOne is the impulse category, where if it\u2019s under $20, they\u2019ll buy it. No matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then the second category would be for really people that are coming in looking for a gift. We\u2019re pushing the $100 sale. We try to keep our best sellers, like those sweaters and those items that people are really grabbing for a nice holiday gift at $99, right under the $100 mark.\u201d",

      "INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Two years ago, Baker Mayfield was trying to salvage his career in Southern California.",
      "On Sunday, Mayfield made a triumphant return in his 100th career start and directed a Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense that made an emphatic statement against one of the NFL's best defenses.",
      "Mayfield threw for 288 yards and four touchdown passes as the Buccaneers dominated the second half in a 40-17 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The NFC South-leading Buccaneers (8-6) trailed 17-10 late in the second quarter before scoring on six straight drives, including five in the second half.",
      "\u201cWe came into halftime and said if the offense didn\u2019t hurt ourselves we will be all right,\" said Mayfield, who completed 22 of 27 passes. \"The defense came out and stopped them and the offensive line took over. It was a complementary football game.\"",
      "Mike Evans had a season-high 159 yards receiving and two scores, including the play that gave the Bucs the lead early in the third quarter.",
      "On second-and-13 at their own 43-yard line, Mayfield eluded pressure and scrambled left before finding Evans for a 57-yard touchdown to give Tampa Bay a 20-17 lead with 10:23 remaining in the third quarter.",
      "Evans lined up as the outside receiver on the right side of the formation, before running across the field. He caught the ball at the Chargers 35, shook off an attempted shoulder tackle from rookie cornerback Tarheeb Still and kept his balance near the sideline before scoring.",
      "\u201cBaker did a great job, they forced him out to the left and I ran with him,\u201d said Evans, who had nine receptions. \u201cWith scrambling quarterbacks, you have to run and get in their vision. He threw a great ball to me, stayed on the sideline and made a play.\u201d",
      "Evans also hauled in a 35-yard pass late in the third quarter to extend the lead to 30-17. It was the veteran wide receiver's 14th game with at least 150 yards receiving, second most among active players. Miami\u2019s Tyreek Hill leads with 16.",

      "\u201cI can only imagine for a defensive coordinator what it is like to scheme against us with the personnel changes and we have a lot of plays off plays in the same formation. It\u2019s tough to defend that,\u201d Mayfield said.",

Brown \u2014 one of those receivers who brought the complaints to a boil \u2014 then had their relationship dissected and thrown under the bus by a teammate, the type of locker room criticism that can unravel a franchise.",
      "Or maybe, the touchy internal evaluation was exactly the kind of incentive Philadelphia needed to flex its superiority in a cross-state showdown with a playoff-bound opponent.",
      "\u201cEvery opportunity to get better, you use,\u201d coach Nick Sirianni said. \u201cI\u2019m not for one minute saying that all the turmoil on the outside was a good thing. We want to make sure that we\u2019re locked into what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s what I felt like.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo that\u2019s what you all wanted to see?\u201d said Hurts, who confirmed he was playing with a broken finger on his non-throwing hand.",
      "Philly's recent friction wasn't fan- or media-driven at all \u2014 like a horror movie, the sounds were coming from inside the house.",
      "Hurts and the Eagles\u2019 offense made the big plays a week after both Smith and Brown griped about a lack of catches in a win over Carolina. Later in the week, injured defensive end Brandon Graham appeared on a Philadelphia sports radio station and suggested there were personal issues at play between Hurts and Brown.",
      "Hurts, who threw for 290 yards and after not topping 200 in any of the last three games, tried to squash any perceived in-house dissention on the opening drive. He connected with Smith twice and Brown once, leading to Jake Elliott\u2019s 34-yard field goal.",
      "\u201cScrutiny is never-ending. It\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I find a thrill in. I appreciate being told I can\u2019t and that we can\u2019t. I know that I lead this team, and it takes a lot out of it. It demands a lot out of you.\u201d",
      "Brown, who walked gingerly on the sideline late in the game, had eight catches for 110 yards, and Smith had 11 for 109 yards a week after they combined for only eight catches and 80 yards.",
      "\u201cBehind closed doors, we talked about it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe called each other out. It was very uncomfortable because we don\u2019t want to feel like we\u2019re getting attacked.\u201d",
      "Hurts hit Brown late in the first quarter for a 5-yard TD \u2014 the pair celebrated with the Kid \u2019N Play dance \u2014 and connected with Smith on a 2-yard score in the second for a 17-3 lead.",

Barkley, who still leads the NFL with 1,688 yards, took a low hit from Pittsburgh\u2019s Minkah Fitzpatrick and missed most of the second quarter. Barkley said his right knee was fine and he wasn't injured on Fitzpatrick's hit.",
      "Hurts also had a rushing touchdown on a tush push for the Eagles (12-2), who were denied a shot a clinching the NFC East when Washington beat New Orleans earlier in the day. AFC North-leading Pittsburgh (10-4) lost for the second time in nine games but clinched a playoff spot thanks to losses by Miami and Indianapolis.",

Watt, who leads the Steelers with 11 1/2 sacks, said he was in \u201cwait-and-see\u201d mode for next week's division showdown at Baltimore. The 30-year-old former defensive player of the year came away with a rolled ankle that he didn\u2019t necessarily believe was a serious injury.",
      "Pittsburgh's Russell Wilson was stymied by the Eagles' defense and threw for a season-low 128 yards. He threw a 9-yard TD pass to Pat Freiermuth while falling to 6-1 lifetime against the Eagles.",
      "It was clear the Steelers missed wide receiver George Pickens, who leads the team in receptions (55) and yards receiving (850) by a wide margin. He missed a second straight game with a hamstring injury.",

      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 Nik Bonitto's defensive touchdown was jaw-dropping. Jonathan Taylor's botched touchdown run was head-scratching.",
      "Bonitto foiled a trick play by stepping in front of quarterback Anthony Richardson and hijacking Adonai Mitchell's lateral pass, then racing 50 yards for a touchdown Sunday that sealed the Denver Broncos' 31-13 win over the Indianapolis Colts.",
      "A blunder by Taylor turned the game around in the third quarter. Indy's star running back dropped the ball milliseconds before crossing the goal line on what would have been a 41-yard touchdown.",
      "\u201cThat can\u2019t happen,\" said Taylor, who finished with 107 yards \u2014 but no touchdowns \u2014 on 22 carries. \u201cNo, you\u2019re never consciously aware you\u2019re dropping the ball. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "The blunder breathed new life into the Broncos, whose special teams and defense would bail out a sputtering offense that managed just 193 yards.",
      "\u201cIf he would have scored that touchdown, it would have been even more of a dogfight to get back,\u201d Denver pass rusher Jonathon Cooper said. \u201cWe would have had a tougher fight. ... I just hope it never happens to us.\u201d",
      "Denver's defenders dejectedly retreated to the sideline, but suddenly the 76,416 fans roared. Safety P.J. Locke said he looked up and saw the replay on the giant scoreboard and suddenly the Broncos had a holiday gift.",
      "Instead of lining up for the extra point to give the Colts a 20-7 lead, the touchback left the reeling Colts clinging to a six-point edge they would soon relinquish.",
      "\u201cThat was a game changer, yeah, absolutely,\u201d Colts coach Shane Steichen said. \u201cObviously, it hurt us, but he\u2019s one of our leaders. Sometimes that happens in football, but he\u2019s our guy, and that\u2019s what you say to him.\u201d",
      "With five takeaways, the Broncos (9-5) ended a seven-year string of losing records and strengthened their grip on an AFC wild-card berth that would end a playoff drought dating to 2016. They began defense of their Super Bowl 50 title that season with a 4-0 start, which was the last time they sat four games above .500.",
      "The Colts (6-8) blew both an early 10-0 lead and a big opportunity to tighten the AFC wild-card race, and the biggest reasons were Taylor's blunder and Bonitto's plunder.",
      "Denver had just taken its first lead of the game on Bo Nix's 15-yard touchdown toss to tight end Nate Adkins that made it 17-13 when Bonitto scored his second touchdown in two games.",
      "Bonitto, who had a pick-6 against Cleveland before the Broncos' bye week, was in full stride when he caught Mitchell's pass at the midfield logo and raced untouched to the end zone.",
      "The play was officially recorded as a fumble recovery and not a pick-6 because it was a backward pass. Whatever you want to call it, Cooper said it was just the spark the Broncos needed.",
      "\u201cMan, I love playing with this dude,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHis football instincts are off the charts. He's a phenomenal football player. He's got my vote for Defensive Player of the Year.\u201d",
      "Mitchell said his coach had admonished him to throw the ball away if he saw the Broncos sniffing out the trickery, but he said he never sensed Denver had deciphered the play.",
      "\u201cIt was there pretty much until 15 turned into Ed Reed and just came through out of nowhere,\u201d Mitchell said.",
      "Denver's five takeaways more than made up for Nix's first three-interception game of his rookie season.",
      "One of Denver's interceptions was by cornerback Patrick Surtain II, who limped to the sideline tent with a sprained right ankle. He went back in the game but was helped off the field just before the 2-minute warning after seemingly aggravating the injury. He left the stadium without comment but wasn't in a walking boot, a good sign because the Broncos have a short week before their next game.",
      "The Broncos' barrage of points started with Wil Lutz's 44-yard field goal that pulled Denver to 13-10 and ended with Nix's 20-yard TD pass to Courtland Sutton.",
      "Richardson completed just five of 17 passes for 56 yards in the first half and one of those completions was to himself. It came in his own end zone after Jonah Ellis batted down his throw.",

      "No one would be totally surprised to see the Jets run it back with Rodgers and Adams, even though the former Green Bay teammates are scheduled to count nearly $52 million against the Jets\u2019 salary cap in 2025.",
      "After all, they showed their potential together against the Jags.",
      "\u201cOh yeah, today was one of those days in the second half,\" Adams said. \u201cDefinitely felt very, very similar to the way we used to get it rolling.\"",
      "Adams' 100th TD grab came on a 1-yard fade route in the third quarter. No. 101 was even more impressive. He streaked down the middle of the field, running past linebacker Devin Lloyd and seeing no safety help from Darnell Savage until it was too late.",
      "Adams was completely uncovered in the flat for the 41-yarder and then tackled at the 1. The Jets probably should have taken a knee from there, forced Jacksonville to use its remaining timeouts and kicked a short field goal to win it. But Hall's plunge gave the Jaguars (3-11) a chance late.",
      "\u201cI wanted to be aggressive, and I wanted the points,\u201d Ulbrich said. \"I wanted to put the nail in the coffin at the end.\u201d",
      "Mac Jones drove Jacksonville into Jets territory before throwing his second interception of the day. Sauce Gardner's first pick of the season essentially ended the game.",
      "Jones completed 31 of 46 passes for 294 yards, with two touchdowns to rookie Brian Thomas Jr. and two interceptions. Thomas finished with 10 catches for 105 yards. Tight end Brenton Strange caught 11 passes for 73 yards.",
      "Jones looked as though he would improve to 6-0 as a starter against the Jets, and the Jaguars looked like they would win consecutive games for the first time in 13 months. But Rodgers and Adams had other thoughts.",
      "The duo has now connected 81 times for touchdowns, including the playoffs, for the fourth most by a QB-WR duo in NFL history. They are one shy of Miami\u2019s Dan Marino and Mark Clayton.",
      "\u201cAaron is a great quarterback. He\u2019s a Hall of Fame quarterback,\u201d Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cThey made plays that we didn\u2019t make, and that part\u2019s unfortunate. It comes down to just a couple plays in your season or your game or whatever could be a little bit different.\u201d",
      "Both teams got off to fast starts \u2014 a rarity this season.",
      "The Jaguars scored a touchdown on their opening drive for the first time in 19 games. It had been the longest drought in the NFL. The Jets answered with their first opening-driving touchdown of the season. Rodgers connected with Garrett Wilson for a 22-yarder after the Jaguars left him wide open down the middle.",
      "Thomas, Jacksonville's first-round draft pick, broke two single-season team rookie receiving records that he had been chasing for weeks. He topped Justin Blackmon\u2019s franchise mark of 865 yards receiving (2012) and hauled in his seventh TD catch, snapping a tie with Allen Hurns (2014).",
      "Jaguars defensive tackle Jeremiah Ledbetter, a 30-year-old veteran and a 300-pound defender, celebrated his third-quarter sack of Rodgers with an impressive backflip. Ledbetter\u2019s second sack of the season resulted in a 14-yard loss and forced the Jets to settle for a field goal.",
      "Jets safety Jalen Mills (chest), safety Tony Adams (facial lacerations), linebacker Jamien Sherwood (evaluated for a concussion), running back Braelon Allen (back) and nickel cornerback Michael Carter (back) left the game. Adams, Sherwood and Allen returned.",
      "Jets: host the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday.",
      "Jaguars: play at the Las Vegas Raiders next Sunday.",

      "Joe Burrow threw for 271 yards with three touchdowns for the franchise record with 36 this season and the Cincinnati Bengals improved their faint playoff hopes by thumping the Tennessee Titans 37-27 in a sloppy game Sunday",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Joe Burrow knows the Cincinnati Bengals' playoff hopes are slender at best at the bottom of the AFC's bubble teams.",
      "He still wants Cincinnati to play better no matter how this season ends.",
      "Burrow threw for 271 yards with three TDs for 36, topping his franchise mark of 35 set in 2022, as the Bengals improved their faint playoff hopes by thumping the Tennessee Titans 37-27 on Sunday. TV cameras picked up a frustrated Burrow talking with coach Zac Taylor after the team's last touchdown of the game.",
      "\u201cWe know the chances are very slim,\" Burrow said. \"What I\u2019m focused on right now is playing as good as we can play myself, playing up to my standard. That\u2019s why I was so frustrated because I didn\u2019t feel like we did that today.\u201d",
      "The Bengals (6-8) notched the 400th regular-season win in franchise history. They still need to win out to extend their streak of winning seasons to four straight no matter where they wind up in the AFC playoff chase.",
      "Starting defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins was out. They lost end Sam Hubbard to an injured knee after his 2-yard TD catch. Hubbard became the first Bengals defensive player to score on a run or pass since safety Bobby Hunt on Oct. 6, 1968, in the franchise's first season, according to Elias Sports Bureau.",
      "It didn't matter as the Bengals turned six turnovers into 24 straight points capped by Geno Stone's 39-yard pick-6 in the third. The Bengals missed out on more points with a 61-yard fumble return for a TD except Jordan Battle fumbled just before crossing the goal line for a touchback in the third quarter.",
      "That doesn't include the 14 penalties for 113 yards.",
      "\u201cUnacceptable but really happy with the way the (defense) got the turnovers,\" Taylor said. (Six) turnovers. Three of them in the second half was huge for us ... It was a strange game that way.\"",
      "The Titans (3-11) benched Will Levis after his NFL-high fourth pick-6 this season and fourth turnover of the game. Mason Rudolph looked ready to lead a rally until he was picked off by Josh Newton.",
      "Tennessee lost its third straight and dropped to 1-6 at home in coach Brian Callahan's debut season and first game against his old boss with the Bengals in Taylor.",
      "Callahan said Burrow did Burrow things and was disappointed at his Titans hurting themselves. They also had 12 penalties for 110 yards.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t stop them on third down and you turn the ball over six times, it\u2019s going to be tough to win,\u201d Callahan said.",
      "Cincinnati played without left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. and Cody Ford was a late scratch because of an illness. The Bengals started Devin Cochran, a rookie with one offensive snap in five appearances before Sunday. Even giving him help, he gave up pressure that led to the first of Burrow's two interceptions.",
      "The Bengals also had four turnovers. The teams combined for the NFL's first 10-turnover game since Week 2 of 2007 when the Lions and Vikings each had five in Detroit's overtime win.",
      "Tennessee led 14-7 at the end of the first after opening with back-to-back TD drives for the first time since Week 4 of the 2022 season. Tony Pollard ran for a 3-yard TD. On the next drive, Tyjae Spears went over the top after his first would-be TD was ruled short.",
      "Burrow opened the game with a 6-yard TD pass to Chase Brown and that TD pass to Hubbard. The Bengals took the lead for good after Cam Taylor-Britt picked off Levis, and Burrow hit Tee Higgins with a 38-yard TD pass for a 21-14 edge.",
      "That gave Burrow his latest franchise TD mark, which he celebrated while on his back.",
      "\u201cI was just hoping it got there,\u201d Burrow said.",
      "Chase, who came in leading the NFL this season in receptions and yards receiving, finished with nine catches for 94 yards.",
      "He became the fifth player in NFL history with at least 100 receptions, 1,400 receiving yards and 15 TD catches in a season. He joined Pro Football Hall of Famers Marvin Harrison (2001), Randy Moss (2003) and Jerry Rice (1995) as well as Cooper Kupp (2021).",
      "With his three TDs, Burrow became the fifth NFL player with at least three TD passes in six straight games. The only quarterbacks with more are Tom Brady (10 straight in 2007), Andrew Luck (eight in 2018), Peyton Manning (eight in 2004) and Dan Marino (seven in 1986-87).",
      "Hubbard was ruled out late in the first half after that TD catch with an injured right knee. Burrow tracked down the ball for his first NFL TD reception.",
      "Pollard, who came into this game questionable with an injured ankle, aggravated the ankle. He returned in the second quarter. LB Kenneth Murray Jr. aggravated his hamstring and was questionable. T\u2019Vondre Sweat hurt a shoulder but returned. Luke Gifford left in the second quarter with a concussion.",
      "The Bengals return home to host Cleveland, while the Titans start a two-game road swing at Indianapolis.",

      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is urging the federal government to deploy advanced drone-tracking technology following weeks of reported drone sightings in parts of New York and New Jersey that have stirred fear and bewilderment",
      "BOSTON -- After weeks of fear and bewilderment about the drones buzzing over parts of New York and New Jersey, elected officials are urging action to identify and stop the mysterious flights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "\u201c'We don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer,\u201d he said.",
      "National security officials have said the drones don\u2019t appear to be a sign of foreign interference or a public safety threat. But because they can\u2019t say with certainty who is responsible for the sudden swarms of drones over parts of New Jersey, New York and other eastern parts of the U.S. \u2014 or how they can be stopped \u2014 leaders of both political parties are demanding better technology and powers to deal with the drones.",
      "Sen. Chuck Schumer called Sunday for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to deploy better drone-tracking technology to identify the drones and their operators.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers have tremendous questions about it,\u201d Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters about the drone sightings. \u201cWe are going to get the answers for them.\u201d",
      "The federal government did little to answer those questions in its own media briefings Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "Some of the drones reported above parts of New York and New Jersey have turned out to be \u201cmanned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the Northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter.\u201d",
      "Last year, federal aviation rules began requiring certain drones to broadcast their remote identification, including the location of their operators. It\u2019s not clear whether that information has been used to determine who is behind the drones plaguing locations over New York and New Jersey. Mayorkas\u2019 office didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether they\u2019ve been able to identify drones using this capability.",
      "Schumer wants the federal government to use a recently declassified radio wave technology in New York and New Jersey. The radio wave detector can be attached to a drone or airplane and can determine whether another flying object is a bird or a drone, read its electronic registration, and follow it back to its landing place. Schumer said state and local authorities do not have the authority to track drones.",
      "On Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said federal officials were sending a drone detection system to the state.",
      "\u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The governor did not immediately provide additional details, including where the system will be deployed.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month over parts of New Jersey, raising concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Drones are now being reported all along the northern East Coast, with suspicious sightings in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to news reports.",
      "Some U.S. political leaders, including Trump, have called for much stronger action against the drones, including shooting them down.",
      "Certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security have the power to \u201cincapacitate\u201d drones, Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cBut we need those authorities expanded,\u201d he said.",
      "A bill before the U.S. Senate would enhance some federal agencies\u2019 authority and give new abilities to local and state agencies to track drones. It would also start a pilot program allowing states and local authorities to disrupt, disable or seize a drone without prior consent of the operator.",
      "\u201cWhat the drone issue points out are gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department,\" Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s pick to be his national security adviser, said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \"Americans are finding it hard to believe we can\u2019t figure out where these are coming from.\u2019\u2019",

      "The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.",
      "The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \u201ca national security\u202for public safety\u202fthreat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d",
      "Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off.

      "Authorities say they do not know.",

      "Donald Trump is hosting Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Cook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.",
      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",
      "Trump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.",
      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt."

      "A federal appeals court has left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States",
      "A federal appeals court on Friday left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States, rejecting a request made by the company to halt enforcement until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge of the statute.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the nation's highest court will take up the case, though some legal experts have said they expect the justices to weigh in due to the types of novel questions it raises about social media, national security and the First Amendment. TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \u201csave\u201d the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.",
      "The court rejected that request on Friday, calling it \u201cunwarranted.\"",
      "\u201cThe petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,\u201d said the court's order, which was unsigned.",
      "The statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing\u2019s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government\u2019s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.",
      "In the request filed this week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a \u201cmodest delay\u201d in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could \u201cdetermine its position\u201d on the matter.",
      "If the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "The Justice Department had opposed TikTok\u2019s request for a pause, saying in a court filing this week that the parties had already proposed a schedule that was \u201cdesigned for the precise purpose\u201d of allowing Supreme Court review of the law before it took effect.",
      "The appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said."

    "title": "'Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in the US, native ones are almost gone",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:10:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
    "story": [
      "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
      "It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct.",
      "But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal.",
      "\u201cYou can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,\u201d said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did.",
      "Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development.",
      "Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking.",
      "Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. \u201cIt was really a pretty significant species to lose,\u201d said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. \u201cThe more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.\u201d",
      "The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is \u2014 blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts.",
      "To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year.",
      "\u201cIt kind of stinks that it happened because now it\u2019s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,\" said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,\u201d Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance.",
      "Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world?",
      "A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbolic to say it\u2019s revolutionary\" for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country.",
      "Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it \u201crobust and well supported\u201d and \u201ccritically important to the success of the chestnut.\u201d",
      "Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. \u201cI think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?\"",
      "For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry.",
      "\u201cThe project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cI want to do something good for the future, for my children.\"",

      "CHATHAM, N.J. -- That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It's unclear if it's drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.",
      "Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.",
      "This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what's behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey's new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.",
      "More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it\u2019s saying. \u201cLet the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" he posted on his social media site.",
      "But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they're looking into what's happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.",
      "Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.",
      "In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.",
      "The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.",
      "One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it\u2019s otherworldly. \u201cStraight up orbs,\u201d the person says. Others weigh in to say it\u2019s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)",
      "Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she's glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.",
      "\u201cI find myself \u2014 instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house \u2014 checking it,\u201d she said.",
      "She doesn't buy what the governor said, that the drones aren't a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \u201ca national security\u202for public safety\u202fthreat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can you say it\u2019s not posing a threat if you don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why so many people are uneasy.\u201d",
      "Then there's the notion that people could misunderstand what they're seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.",
      "Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they're looking at.",
      "Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.",
      "\u201cIt represents the United States of America in 2024,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.\u201d",
      "Federal officials echo Austin's view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.",
      "That's not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.",
      "For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it\u2019s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.",
      "\u201cMy main goal is I don\u2019t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,\u201d he added.",

      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",
      "The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk\u2019s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,\u201d says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk\u2019s foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk\u2019s requested order, saying it would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.",
      "Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would \u201cunequivocally have initial control of the company\u201d but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",
      "In the same email, titled \u201cHonest Thoughts,\u201d Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by \u201cpolitical goals.\u201d Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered \u201cOpen Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,\u201d a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the \u201cHonest Thoughts\u201d email that Musk described as the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,\u201d Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.",
      "Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.",
      "Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt \u201ctremendously sad\u201d but also characterized Musk\u2019s legal fight as one about business competition.",

      "Murphy, a Democrat, made the request in a letter Thursday, noting that state and local law enforcement remain \u201chamstrung\u201d by existing laws and policies in their efforts to successfully counteract any nefarious activity of unmanned aircraft. He posted a copy of the letter on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cThis leaves action surrounding the (drones) squarely on the shoulders of the federal government,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMore federal resources are needed to understand what is behind this activity.\u201d",

      "The drones have drawn intense public concern and curiosity since residents first reported seeing them last month. Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said from four to 180 aircraft have been reported to authorities since Nov. 18, appearing from dusk till 11 p.m.",
      "The flying objects have been spotted  near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster, but the number of reported sightings has grown greatly since then. Drones were also spotted in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic region.",
      "The FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and other state and federal agencies involved in the investigation have not corroborated any of the reported sightings with electronic detection, and reviews of available images appear to show many of the reported drones are actually manned aircraft. They also say there have been no confirmed sightings in restricted air space. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been seen and reported more than once, officials said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to President-Elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed the move on Friday. The announcement comes one day after Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it donated $1 million to the same fund. Amazon also said it plans to donate $1 million.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Altman, who is in a legal dispute with rival Elon Musk, has said he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO's influence in the incoming administration.",
      "Trump is putting Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, in charge of the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is an outside advisory committee that will work with people inside the government to reduce spending and regulations.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits. Musk recently escalated the lawsuit by asking a federal judge to stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",

    "summary": "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
    "story": [
      "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
      "You never forget your first time seeing a giant salamander, according to Andy Hill.",
      "He was a teenager, standing thigh-high in the Watauga River outside Boone, North Carolina, casting a line on an early fall day when he saw his first eastern hellbender. The salamander stretched 2 feet long and was camouflaged among rocks beneath the clear water.",
      "\u201cYou never lose your sense of wonder and otherworldliness when you see one,\u201d said Hill, who now works as the Watauga Riverkeeper for MountainTrue, a nonprofit protecting natural ecosystems in western North Carolina, home to part of the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
      "The ancient species, which evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs, was submitted for federal protection Friday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. If the proposal is adopted after a period of public comment, the creatures will be protected under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their population in the U.S. has rapidly declined in recent decades; dams, industry and even flooding worsened by climate change have threatened their habitat and ability to reproduce and find food. Today, just 12% of eastern hellbenders are successfully reproducing.",
      "Hellbenders in the Blue Ridge Mountains had been considered the healthiest population of the eastern subspecies but were devastated this fall by Hurricane Helene. Thousands were displaced or found dead amid rubble. Others were found in flooded church basements and returned to the river. But some rivers are so polluted, there\u2019s still a \u201cdo not touch\u201d advisory for people.",
      "Tierra Curry burst into tears when she learned of the proposed protection.",
      "\u201cI just think it's a moral failure that we're pushing them to the brink of extinction,\u201d said Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The slimy, brown creature with a broad, flat head may never win a beauty contest, but it is famous as the largest amphibian in North America.",
      "The hellbender breathes dissolved oxygen in the water through its skin. Water that becomes slow-moving, warm or polluted holds less oxygen.",
      "Over the past five years, two dams were removed on the Watauga River to help improve water quality and reconnect hellbender communities. The most recent one came down this summer \u2014 and two months later, Helene upended life not just for people, but also for animals like the salamander.",
      "For those working to ensure the species' survival, the newly proposed federal protection couldn't come soon enough, said Erin McCombs, Southeast conservation director for American Rivers.",
      "\u201cWe have to be paying more attention to the health of our nation's rivers and streams, and that means paying more attention to the critters that live in them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen species like the hellbender, which are reliant on free-flowing and clean water, are declining, alarms need to be going off, because we'll feel the impacts next.\u201d",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned and won protection for the Ozark subspecies of hellbenders in 2011 and for Missouri hellbenders, another population of eastern hellbender, in 2021. The group sued, seeking protection for all eastern hellbenders. As of this week, all hellbenders in the U.S. are protected or slated for protection under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Hill says he hopes the new federal protection will usher in \u201cbold strategies\u201d to help the species recover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a massive effort,\" he said.",

      "Associated Press writer Lou Kesten has chosen his top 10 video games of 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been a rough year in the world of video games, which reeled from some high-profile flops (sorry, Suicide Squad and Star Wars fans) and a relentless series of developer layoffs. Fortunately, indie designers stepped up to fill in the gaps. And toward the end of the year, a few AAA studios rallied with ambitious, big-budget adventures.",
      "The top 10 games of 2024 recall a brighter age when it seemed like anything was possible in our virtual worlds. Here\u2019s hoping the industry learns from their success.",
      "In a politically exhausting year, Japan\u2019s Studio Zero pulled off the seemingly impossible: rendering the process of reforming a corrupt world with something resembling \u2026 hope? The corruption that has beset the quasi-medieval Euchronia is quite literal, embodied by hideous mutants known (rather unsubtly) as \u201chumans.\u201d The fight to restore sanity blends stirring battles with unusually thoughtful reflections on justice, all with the eye-popping visuals you\u2019d expect from the creators of the Persona series.",
      "The last few years have brought a surge in so-called \u201cmetroidvanias\u201d \u2014 enormous two-dimensional mazes that blend arcade action with tricky puzzles. Solo designer Billy Basso\u2019s Animal Well is the apex, presenting a vast underground network whose inhabitants range from mice to flamingos. Every challenge you solve opens a smorgasbord of new challenges, and it\u2019s easy to get lost for hours in its eerie, hallucinatory world.",
      "In this drama from Sweden\u2019s Simigo, a young woman is invited to explore a hotel that\u2019s been seemingly abandoned by its owner, an avant-garde filmmaker. Every room has a puzzle, and the more you solve the deeper you fall under its spell. It\u2019s like being trapped in a David Lynch movie, where you\u2019re always questioning the boundaries between dreams and reality.",
      "BioWare, the studio behind landmark role-playing games like Mass Effect and the original Baldur\u2019s Gate, finally returns to its strengths with this fantasy epic. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, with a motley crew of fighters, mages and rogues joining forces against a world-threatening evil. The combat is engaging, the stories are unpredictable and the characters are endearingly loopy.",
      "The most endearing character of the year has to be the adorable protagonist of this adventure from Sony\u2019s Team Asobi. The spunky little robot is on a planet-hopping mission to rescue dozens of his fellow droids, with each stop presenting a fresh assortment of running, jumping and punching challenges. It\u2019s the sort of game we used to see more of on the PlayStation, and it\u2019s thoroughly delightful.",
      "Luisa is a burnt-out corporate drone who needs a break. So why not head to the Alps and cut loose by fighting some monsters? Compared to Metaphor and Dragon Age, the dungeons devised by Austria\u2019s Microbird Games are more tightly focused, given that you can only take a few magic spells on each expedition. But the puzzles are clever, and this oddball tourist town has other intriguing mysteries worth investigating.",
      "More dungeons, as Nintendo returns to Hyrule. At long last you get to play as Princess Zelda, who wields a scepter that allows her to duplicate the tools she needs to surmount obstacles \u2014 or summon creatures to fight her foes. Echoes combines the top-down action of 1987\u2019s original-recipe Zelda with the improvisation of last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d and should satisfy fans of both.",
      "Bethesda Softworks delivers a rarity, a AAA action-adventure in which the protagonist spends more time quietly figuring out the enigmas of the Egyptian pyramids and Vatican City than mindlessly shooting enemies. Veteran voice actor Troy Baker does a fine job standing in for Harrison Ford, the dialog sparkles and the graphics are stunningly detailed. It\u2019s one of 2024\u2019s biggest surprises \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, you do get to punch Nazis.",
      "This indie smash from solo developer LocalThunk looks simple: a solitaire version of poker in which you score points by racking up good hands. Throw in some jokers, though \u2014 say, a \u201cGreedy Joker\u201d that makes diamonds more valuable \u2014 and it gets complicated. The higher your score, the more jokers become available. It\u2019s a classic \u201cjust one more hand\u201d hook; don\u2019t download Balatro if you expect to get anything else done today.",
      "A team of indie developers led by Spelunky designer Derek Yu conjured up this tribute to the games of the 1980s. It\u2019s insanely ambitious, with 50 complete games ranging across every imaginable genre, from shoot-'em-ups to strategy to racing to role-playing. There\u2019s even a Pong variant. It\u2019s a feast for anyone who remembers the dawn of video games \u2014 or is too young to have been there."

      "The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance. The new agreement, signed Friday in Beijing after many months of negotiations, has a narrower scope and additional safeguards to minimize the risk to national security.",
      "The State Department said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails to protect the safety and security of researchers and \"advances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.\u201d",
      "It covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said. This includes technologies related to artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which are considered crucial for economic strength and military supremacy.",
      "China's science and technology ministry also announced the signing, but provided no details or assessment in its one-line statement. The Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this year that such cooperation is mutually beneficial.",
      "The first such agreement was signed in January 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and when China severely lagged behind the U.S. and other Western nations in science and technology.",
      "The agreement was last extended in 2018, and given temporary extensions last year and this year to allow for negotiations. Washington had come to view the agreement as failing to reflect the shift in U.S.-China relations and China\u2019s emergence as a heavyweight in the field. The new agreement extends cooperation for five years.",
      "As the tech war between the two countries has escalated, the U.S. has banned exports of advanced chips to China and restricted U.S. investments in certain technologies that could boost China's military capabilities. Cooperation in science and technology chilled in universities and research institutions after a Trump-era program was introduced to curb China's spying. The program was ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and because of concerns that it had prompted racial profiling.",
      "Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University, said the new agreement would lead to fewer government-to-government programs, but, through its limited scope and stronger safeguards, it would allow for the cooperation to be sustained \u201cthrough a more difficult relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Rep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, said the decades-long cooperation had resulted in the U.S. \u201cproviding all sorts of scientific and technical knowledge to Chinese scientists in what would amount to the greatest outpouring of American scientific and technology expertise in history.\u201d",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, argued that the U.S. and the global community also have benefited from research collaborations that have \u201cprevented diseases, reduced pollution, and deepened our understanding of the Earth's history.\u201d",
      "But Meeks said he favored congressional oversight to ensure projects under the agreement would be in line with U.S. values and interests."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world\u2019s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.",
      "The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.",
      "A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.",
      "New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale\u2019s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d van Helden said in a statement.",
      "All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn\u2019t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.",
      "The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.",
      "Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.",
      "\u201cThese little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It\u2019s remarkable to see this and it\u2019s just another thing that we had no idea about,\u201d van Helden said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week I\u2019ll never forget in my life, it\u2019s certainly a highlight and it\u2019s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,\u201d van Helden added.",
      "The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local M\u0101ori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.",
      "Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.",
      "To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.",
      "The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people\u2019s lives and businesses. And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages.",
      "Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement.",
      "The demand on the grid has not let up, however \u2014 even as Iranians stopped using air conditioners as the weather cooled in the fall and before winter months set in, when people fire up their gas heaters.",
      "Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining \u2014 sucking away huge amounts of power \u2014 has played a part in the outages in Iran.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,\" Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August.",
      "Iran\u2019s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours.",
      "Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation.",
      "Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls.",
      "For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must \"honestly tell the public about the energy situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,\u201d he said in mid-November. \u201cI myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.\"",
      "Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran \u2014 raising questions where the power is going.",
      "In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power.",
      "And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool.",
      "Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer.",
      "Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. \u201cThey distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,\" Alavi said.",
      "In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally.",
      "Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms.",
      "The farms have caused \u201can abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,\u201d Rajabi said.",
      "The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province \u2014 one of the country's chief manufacturing sites.",
      "Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner.",

      "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released in Cambodia recently in just a few days, offering new hope for the survival for the species",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species.",
      "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weigh up to 300 kilograms (661 pounds), or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are only found in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 4,900-kilometer (3,044 mile)-long river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province.",
      "The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades due to rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions.",
      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 2 meters (6.5 feet) that weighed 120 kilograms and 131 kilograms (264 pounds and 288 pounds), respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\u201d said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\u201cThis information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\u201d said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region\u2019s cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",

Residents of the area known as Starbase submitted the petition, according to the company.",
      "The area is on the southern tip of Texas at Boca Chica Beach, near the Mexican border. Earlier this year, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media company X from California to Texas.",
      "\u201cTo continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase, wrote in a letter to the county.",
      "It's not the first time turning Starbase into its own city has been floated. Musk proposed the idea in 2021 when he wrote a social media post that simply said, \u201cCreating the city of Starbase, Texas.\u201d",
      "Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevi\u00f1o Jr., the county\u2019s top elected official, said despite the talks of incorporation in 2021, this was the first time a petition was officially filed.",
      "\u201cOur legal and elections administration will review the petition, see whether or not it complied with all of the statutory requirements and then we\u2019ll go from there,\" Trevi\u00f1o said on Thursday.",

      "SpaceX's rapid expansion in the region has drawn pushback from some locals. Earlier this year, a group called Save RGV sued the company in July over allegations of environmental violations and dumping polluted water into the nearby bay. SpaceX said in response that a state review found no environmental risks and called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous.\u201d"

      "No-fly zones are enforced around airports, military installations, nuclear plants, certain landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and sports stadiums during games.",
      "Not everybody follows the rules. Sightings at airports have shut down flights in a few instances.",
      "Reported sightings of what appear to be drones flying over New Jersey at night in recent weeks have created anxiety among some residents, in part because it is not clear who is operating them or why. Some state and local officials have called for stricter rules to govern drones.",
      "After receiving reports of drone activity last month near Morris County, New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary bans on drone flights over a golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that is owned by President-elect Donald Trump, and over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base. The FAA says the bans are in response to requests from \u201cfederal security partners.\u201d",
      "The FAA is responsible for the regulations governing their use, and Congress has written some requirements into law.",
      "With a 2018 law, the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, Congress gave certain agencies in the Homeland Security and Justice departments authority to counter threats from unmanned aircraft to protect the safety of certain facilities.",
      "New drones must be outfitted with equipment allowing law enforcement to identify the operator, and Congress gave the agencies the power to detect and take down unmanned aircraft that they consider dangerous.",
      "The law spells out where the counter-drone measures can be used, including \u201cnational special security events\u201d such as presidential inaugurations and other large gatherings of people.",
      "To get a \u201cremote pilot certificate,\u201d you must be at least 16 years old, be proficient in English, pass an aeronautics exam, and not suffer from a \u201dmental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system.\u201d",
      "Yes, but the FAA imposes restrictions on nighttime operations. Most drones are not allowed to fly at night unless they are equipped with anti-collision lights that are visible for at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).",
      "Over the past decade, pilots have reported hundreds of close calls between drones and airplanes including airline jets. In some cases, airplane pilots have had to take evasive action to avoid collisions.",
      "Drones buzzing over a runway caused flights to be stopped at London\u2019s Gatwick Airport during the Christmas travel rush in 2018 and again in May 2023. Police dismissed the idea of shooting down the drones, fearing that stray bullets could kill someone.",
      "Advances in drone technology have made it harder for law enforcement to find rogue drone operators \u2014 bigger drones in particular have more range and power.",
      "Some state and local officials in New Jersey are calling for stronger restrictions because of the recent sightings, and that has the drone industry worried.",
      "Scott Shtofman, director of government affairs at the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said putting more limits on drones could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on \u201ca growing economic engine for the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would definitely oppose anything that is blindly pushing for new regulation of what are right now legal drone operations,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt's a brand new technology that's not really understood real well, so it will raise fear and anxiety in a lot of people,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe want to be good professional aviators and alleviate that.\u201d",

The new $82.99 a month price tag will go into effect starting Jan. 13 for existing subscribers, and immediately for new customers who sign up going forward.",

      "Google's video giant also directed customers to an online FAQ for more information. Those who currently pay discounted prices, for example, won't see the change until their trial or promotional has elapsed.",
      "YouTube TV has rolled out a series of price hikes over the years. When launched back in 2017, the going price of its streaming package was $35 a month. By 2019, that fee rose to $50 \u2014 and has climbed higher and higher since. The last time YouTube TV raised its base price, then to $72.99, was in March 2023.",
      "Earlier increases arrived as YouTube TV added more and more channels for subscribers to stream live. But licensing disputes have also added pressures \u2014 and YouTube has instead attributed its more recent hikes, like those announced both Thursday and last year, to rising operational costs.",
      "YouTube TV currently advertises more than 100 channels from broadcast, cable and regional sports networks, a DVR with unlimited storage and up to six accounts per household with three concurrent streams. And the platform says its latest price increase won't change any of that.",
      "While YouTube TV's live offerings are much different than individual online libraries seen from other popular streamers today, it\u2019s no secret that streaming is getting more expensive overall \u2014 particularly as consumers juggle multiple subscriptions to access all the content they want. In recent years, big names like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Disney+ have all either hikes their prices or added things like ad-supported tiers and password limits.",
      "And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV's new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney\u2019s Hulu + Live TV bundle.",

LOUIS -- Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies \u2014 workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday.",
      "The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said.",
      "Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.",
      "Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects.",
      "Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this:",
      "North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those \u201cdomestic enablers,\u201d too.",
      "\u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program.",
      "In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government\u2019s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea\u2019s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy.",
      "In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans \u201cto obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.\u201d The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un \u201chas placed increased focus on education and training\u201d in IT-related subjects.",
      "In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation.",
      "Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. \u201cOne of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,\u201d she said.",
      "Officials didn\u2019t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Neanderthals and humans likely mixed and mingled during a narrow time frame 45,000 years ago, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Researchers analyzed ancient genes to pinpoint the time period, which is slightly more recent than previous estimates for the mating.",
      "Modern humans emerged in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago and eventually spread to Europe, Asia and beyond. Somewhere along the way, they met and mated with Neanderthals, leaving a lasting fingerprint on our genetic code.",

They also examined bone fragments from an early human population in Ranis, Germany, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) away. They found snippets of Neanderthal DNA that placed the mating at around 45,000 years ago.",
      "In a separate study, researchers tracked signs of Neanderthal in our genetic code over 50,000 years. They found Neanderthal genes related to immunity and metabolism that may have helped early humans survive and thrive outside of Africa.",
      "We still carry Neanderthals' legacy in our DNA. Modern-day genetic quirks linked to skin color, hair color and even nose shape can be traced back to our extinct former neighbors. And our genetic code also contains echoes from another group of extinct human cousins called Denisovans.",

      "There was a slight downward trend in several popular apps teens used. For instance, 63% of teens said they used TikTok, down from 67% and Snapchat slipped to 55% from 59%. This small decline could be due to pandemic-era restrictions easing up and kids having more time to see friends in person, but it's not enough to be truly meaningful.",
      "X saw the biggest decline among teenage users. Only 17% of teenagers said they use X, down from 23% in 2022, the year Elon Musk bought the platform. Reddit held steady at 14%. About 6% of teenagers said they use Threads, Meta's answer to X that launched in 2023.",
      "The report comes as countries around the world are grappling with how to handle the effects of social media on young people's well-being. Australia recently passed a law banning kids under 16 from social networks, though it's unclear how it will be able to enforce the age limit \u2014 and whether it will come with unintended consequences such as isolating vulnerable kids from their peers.",
      "Meta's messaging service WhatsApp was a rare exception in that it saw the number of teenage users increase, to 23% from 17% in 2022.",

To get that perspective of how big they are is really difficult.\u201d",
      "Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.",
      "The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don\u2019t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.",

      "Gabbard, a vocal non-interventionist, has seen her credentials come under scrutiny, particularly in light of a regime change in Syria and her covert meeting with former strongman Bashar Assad in 2017, which occurred after he had used chemical weapons on protesters.

      "Aaron Siri has been interviewing candidates for top jobs at HHS.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s personal attorney previously lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, highlighting an influential Kennedy ally who, sources tell ABC News, has been helping interview candidates for top health jobs in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The matter could be something RFK Jr. gets questioned about when he goes to Capitol Hill next week to meet with senators considering whether to confirm him as health and human services secretary..",
      "Aaron Siri, a partner at the law firm Siri & Glimstad, has long fought against the prevalence of vaccines. He has also filed petitions seeking to pause the distribution of other vaccines, including Hepatitis B, and to revoke the emergency-use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "The 2022 polio petition was made on behalf of one of Siri's clients, the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), a group founded by Del Bigtree, another close Kennedy ally also involved in health-related transition matters, according to sources.",
      "\"Petitioner requests that the FDA withdraw or suspend the approval for [the polio vaccine] for infants, toddlers, and children until a properly controlled and properly powered double-blind trial of sufficient duration is conducted to assess the safety of this product,\" Siri wrote.",
      "The New York Times reported on the petition earlier Friday.",
      "When asked for comment, Siri referenced posts he made on the social site X, where he reiterated his belief that the FDA ignored safety concerns with the vaccine. It\u2019s an allegation strongly refuted by medical experts who say the benefits far outweigh the risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.",
      "Kennedy, meanwhile, did not respond to written questions about whether he agrees with revoking approval of the polio vaccine, or if, as health and human services secretary, he would intervene in an FDA review of Siri's petitions.",
      "The polio vaccine available in the United States is recommended for children and three doses offer at least 99% protection against severe disease, including paralysis, according to the CDC. Side effects are usually mild and go away on their own, the agency notes, and the vaccine has not been known to cause serious problems.",
      "Since the late 1980s, global polio cases have decreased by more than 99% alongside increased vaccination efforts to eradicate the disease, from an estimated 350,000 cases to just six reported in 2021, according to the World Health Organization. The efforts have allowed an estimated 20 million people to walk today who would have otherwise been paralyzed and saved more than 1.5 million lives, according to the CDC.",
      "The polio vaccine has been a part of routine childhood schedule for decades, and federal health officials utilize multiple systems to monitor for vaccine safety. Polio can cause lifelong paralysis and up to 10% of children who have paralysis from polio die, as the virus affects the muscles that allow them to breathe, the CDC notes.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, said in a statement provided to reporters that any efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures is not only uninformed, but also dangerous.",
      "\"Like millions of families before them, my parents knew the pain and fear of watching their child struggle with the life-altering diagnosis of polio,\" he said. \"From the age of two, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love. But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine.",
      "McConnell added that efforts to undermine confidence in the vaccine are dangerous and suggested Kennedy should make it clear he doesn\u2019t agree with Siri's views if he wants to be confirmed as health secretary.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on RFK Jr. to \"state his position\" on the matter.",

      "Trump was asked if his presidency would be considered a \"failure\" if he didn't deliver on his promise to slash Americans' food bills.",
      "\"I don't think so. Look, they got them up,\" referring to the Biden-Harris administration. \"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,\" Trump said.",
      "The president-elect then added he believed lower prices were possible through boosting energy production and solving supply chain issues.",
      "\"But I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down. I think a better supply chain is going to bring them down. You know, the supply chain is still broken. It's broken,\" Trump said.",
      "Just last week, Trump told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he won the election because of immigration and the economy.",
      "\"I won on the border, and I won on groceries,\" he told NBC's Kristen Welker. \"Very simple word, groceries. Like almost -- you know, who uses the word? I started using the word -- the groceries. When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We're going to bring those prices way down.\"",
      "Exit polls showed deep discontent with the economy was a big factor in driving voters to Trump.",
      "Inflation spiked to more than 9% during the Biden-Harris administration, a 40-year high. Negative views on the economy plagued President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the share of people saying they've gotten worse off under the current administration surpassing even Great Recession levels, according to exit poll analysis.",
      "Inflation has since cooled to 2.7% as of November. The latest CPI report found some food items like rice, flour and bacon fell over the past year. But the cost of eggs skyrocketed because of an avian flu outbreak.",

    "story": [
      "\"We want to do it right,\" Rounds said, making major changes unlikely on Day 1.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who introduced legislation last month to eliminate the Department of Education, told ABC News closing the agency could take \"a couple of years.\"",
      "\"We want to do it right,\" Rounds said, making it unlikely the department will see major changes on Day 1 of the next administration. \"This is not just a 'make noise' bill. This is a serious [bill]. It's taken us a year and a half to write this bill.\"",
      "Rounds' \"Returning Education to Our States\" bill builds on one of President-elect Donald Trump's key campaign promises. It has a road map to elimination, sending block grants to states and redistributing major federal funding to other agencies, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate to pass and then be signed into law.",
      "\"We've tried to set this up so that some of it could be done within reconciliation. Some of it we'll have to gain consensus on by executive order, some of which may very well take 60 votes. So we might not get everything we want,\" Rounds acknowledged.",
      "Rounds said he has not met with or discussed the bill with Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary pick. Meanwhile, Rounds insisted that federal programs affecting vulnerable students and those with special needs will not be gutted.",
      "\"We don't want to lose the specific offices that deliver particular congressionally directed funds, such as special education, IDEA and so forth,\" said Rounds, referencing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \"All of that is included in a redirection to other locations, but all those offices still remain with the focus of sending that money back [to the states].\"",
      "Earlier this week, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a member of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told ABC News that reaching a 60-vote threshold to pass legislation that dismantles the agency would be \"very difficult.\"",
      "\"We need to downsize it,\" Tuberville said. \"More money needs to go back to the states, every state, and you know, we can have a group up here that can -- they can supposedly be the Department of Education, but to have [4,000] or 5,000 people up here makes no sense. I mean, we need to take as much money as we can, put it back in the states, put it back in the schools and give these students a chance.\"",
      "Augustus Mays, vice president for partnerships and engagement at the advocacy group The Education Trust, said block grants could disproportionately affect marginalized students.",
      "\"If you were to take away, or block grant, the funding that goes towards IDEA, then you will have a situation where students with disabilities may not be getting the support they need towards a free and appropriate public education, which is required by law,\" Mays told ABC News.",
      "\"That could be $34 billion from the federal government that would be going out to all these states to support those needs, and states would be picking up that bill. \u2026 [Lawmakers] need to understand what that would actually mean if they were to eliminate Department of Ed,\" he warned.",
      "However, if the president-elect and his Cabinet picks start firing federal employees, education experts suggest it would be too tall a task for a diminished department to administer Education Department funds to states and have states distribute them to school districts. Clare McCann at American University said that is something skilled employees at the Department of Education would be equipped to do.",
      "\"There's a reason the Department of Education was created, and it was to have this kind of in-house expertise and policy background on these [education] issues,\" McCann told ABC News. \"The civil servants who work at the Department of Education are true experts in the field.\"",
      "North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican, said he disagreed with McCann's stance.",
      "\"The goal is more education, right?\" he said. \"And do you need a massive government bureaucracy to do that? Probably not.\"",
      "Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie told ABC News he will also be bringing forward legislation to abolish the Department of Education within the \"first few weeks\" of the 119th Congress.",
      "\"There'll be one sentence -- only thing that will change is the date: The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2026,\" Massie told ABC News.",
      "However, experts have told ABC News that Massie's one-sentence bill may not be realistic as all the funding that currently goes to the department will have to be redirected.",
      "\"The Department of Education administers a whole lot of laws,\" said Neal McCluskey, an education analyst at the libertarian think tank The Cato Institute. \"Those laws have to be changed about who runs student aid and who is tasked with making decisions about cancelling student debt and who decides or who administers Title I and lots of these other federal programs.\"",

      "Automation causes \"distress, hurt, and harm\" for U.S. workers, Trump says.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump this week voiced support for tens of thousands of unionized dockworkers in a dispute with major shipping companies.",
      "Negotiations between workers and management are deadlocked over the companies\u2019 plan for further automation of ports, which the union said would eliminate jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on Truth Social. \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\u201d",
      "The vow of support for dockworkers aligns with Trump\u2019s campaign promise to safeguard blue-collar workers threatened by global capitalism, depicting automation as an unwelcome change foisted on workers by foreign-owned shipping firms, some experts said.",
      "Trump\u2019s rejection of automation highlights a tension found in his economic policy, however, some experts added.",
      "Like tariffs, the policy aims to protect a narrow set of workers at the possible expense of importers and consumers, who could suffer higher costs as a result of a missed opportunity to improve the supply chain, some experts said. While others defended Trump\u2019s attempt to protect dockworkers from technological change.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the labor dispute over automation at East and Gulf Coast docks, and what it says about how Trump may approach the economy in his second term.",
      "Dockworkers and freight companies feud over automation",
      "A strike in October at docks across the East and Gulf coasts threatened to upend the economy and drive up prices, but workers and management ended the stoppage with a tentative agreement after three days.",
      "The deal includes a 62% wage increase over the life of the six-year contract, but the two sides have yet to finalize it due to a disagreement over plans for further automation.",
      "The standoff centers on the potential installation of cranes that would facilitate the retrieval and storage of freight containers, said John McCown, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for Maritime Strategy who closely tracks the shipping industry.",
      "Cranes already help remove containers from a ship and place it in a nearby port terminal, but shipping companies have sought the use of additional automated cranes once goods have reached land, McCown said.",
      "The cranes work like an old-fashioned juke box, he added. \u201cYou hit a number and it goes to pick a record and play a record,\u201d McCown said, noting the cranes would similarly mechanize sorting and transport of containers.",
      "The U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, the organization representing shipping firms in negotiations, said on Thursday that such automation would improve efficiency and increase capacity. Those enhancements would benefit U.S. companies and consumers that depend on goods from abroad, the group added.",
      "\u201cWe need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,\u201d USMX said in a statement.",
      "The USMX did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "The plans have drawn rebuke from the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, or ILA, the union representing dockworkers. The union has pointed to massive profits enjoyed by the shipping firms during the pandemic, saying further automation would invest those gains in job-cutting machinery rather than increased compensation. Workers have also disputed the supposed productivity benefits of the technology.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about safety or productivity -- it\u2019s about job elimination,\u201d ILA President Dennis Daggett, said in a statement earlier this month. The union has proven that the automated cranes at issue \u201care not more productive than traditional equipment operated by human workers,\u201d Daggett added.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the ILA shared a statement from Daggett praising Trump.",
      "\"Throughout my career, I\u2019ve never seen a politician -- let alone the President of the United States -- truly understand the importance of the work our members do every single day,\" Daggett said.",
      "What could Trump\u2019s approach to the standoff mean for his 2nd term?",
      "In his social media post backing the workers and opposing port automation, Trump criticized foreign-owned shipping firms for what he described as penny pinching.",
      "\u201cFor the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is time to put AMERICA FIRST!\u201d",
      "The framework presents U.S. workers as victims of foreign companies, which he says aim to make use of America\u2019s economic resources at the expense of its citizens. As such, Trump\u2019s intervention in this case favors the ILA in its longstanding fight against automation, Peter Cole, a professor at Western Illinois University who studies the history of dockworkers, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe ILA will really benefit if in fact Trump pushes employers to back off automation,\u201d Cole said, noting that the explanation offered up by Trump reflects a larger political shift in the U.S. against unrestricted global trade.",
      "\u201cPresidents in both main parties have supported more manufacturing domestically,\u201d Cole said.",
      "However, Trump\u2019s opposition to automation risks imposing higher costs on consumers and even some domestic manufacturers, since advances in productivity would help lower supply costs otherwise passed along to buyers at the end of the chain, some experts said.",
      "Trump mistakenly claims that foreign shipping companies would bear the cost of forgone automation, just as he inaccurately says that foreign countries would pay the cost of tariffs, David Autor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in technological change and the labor force, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe assertion that raising tariffs at our ports will force foreigners to cover these costs is beyond naive,\u201d Autor said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply false.",
      "Autor said the hardship that dockworkers would face if automation were to advance and put many of them out of work. \u201cIt will not be good for the livelihoods of longshoremen and we should not pretend otherwise,\u201d Autor said, adding that the workers should receive compensation or other protections under such circumstances.",

      "The only path forward in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case in New York is vacating his conviction and dismissing the case prior to Trump taking office, lawyers for the president-elect argued in a court filing unsealed Friday.",
      "Trump's lawyers, responding to a filing by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unsealed Tuesday, rejected each of Bragg's proposals to preserve the president-elect's conviction while respecting the office of the presidency, accusing Bragg of \"thuggish tactics\" by proposing the judge in the case delay Trump's sentencing until 2029.",
      "\"[A] stay would require President Trump to lead the Country while facing the ongoing threat that this Court and DANY are prepared to impose imprisonment, fines, and other punishment as soon as he leaves Office,\" the filing said. \"To be clear, President Trump will never deviate from the public interest in response to these thuggish tactics.\"",
      "Trump's lawyers also described a plan proposed by Bragg to abate Trump's conviction -- a mechanism generally used when a defendant has died while a case is pending -- as \"unhinged\" and \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"As a further illustration of DA Bragg's desperation to avoid legally mandated dismissal, DANY proposes that the Court pretend as if one of the assassination attempts against President Trump had been successful,\" wrote Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has nominated to top jobs in the Department of Justice.",
      "Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election -- but his sentencing in the case has been indefinitely postponed following his reelection. Trump's lawyers have argued that the entire case should be dismissed because a sitting president is immune from prosecution.",
      "In their filing earlier this week, prosecutors proposed three alternative options to preserve Trump's sentencing while respecting the prohibition on prosecuting presidents, including delaying the sentencing until 2029, abating the sentencing -- which would terminate the case but preserve the record of his conviction -- or sentencing Trump to a punishment that does not include incarceration.",
      "Trump's lawyers rejected each option as unconstitutional and called the case politically motivated, taking the unusual step of citing in the filing's introduction a Truth Social post by Sen. John Fetterman in which the Pennsylvania Democrat called the case an example of \"weaponizing the judiciary.\"",
      "\"DA Bragg's interest in maintaining the jury's verdicts as a notch in whatever belt he plans to wear to campaign events in 2025 is not a basis for interfering with the Executive Branch,\" the filing said.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that delaying the sentencing until Trump leaves office in 2029 would unfairly require Trump to serve as president while the threat of potential imprisonment hangs over him.",
      "\"Staying the proceedings during President Trump's second term would impede the Presidency and give New York County intolerable leverage over the Executive Branch, which exists for the protection of the entire Nation,\" the filing said.",
      "The filing argued that prosecutors' proposal to abate the case would violate Trump's right to appeal, and sentencing Trump to something other than prison or jail would still be a \"grave and impermissible\" danger to the functions of the presidency.",
      "\"One would expect more from a first-year law student, and this is yet another indication that DANY's opposition to this motion has not been undertaken in good faith,\" Trump's lawyers said about the abatement idea.",
      "The filing took an overtly political tone, repeatedly referencing Bragg's 2025 campaign for reelection and accusing the district attorney of politicizing the case \"to defend his poor record.\"",
      "\"It is abundantly clear at this point that DANY will say and do anything -- including urging the Court to disregard the Constitution, the New York Court of Appeals, and the Second Circuit -- to try to make this abomination stick,\" the filing said.",

      "More than 600,000 people annually visit Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park in the small town of Rovaniemi in Finland",
      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday thanked deep-pocketed Democratic donors who raised record sums in last month's election loss to President-elect Donald Trump and urged them not to lose hope and to remain politically engaged.",
      "Biden and Harris, along with their spouses, in remarks at the Democratic National Committee holiday reception sought to buck up key donors who the Democratic Party needs to stay committed as it tries to pick up the pieces. Republicans scored a decisive victory taking the White House and Senate while maintaining control of the House in an election where donors of all political stripes spent about $4.7 billion.",
      "\u201cWe all get knocked down. My dad would say when you get knocked down, you just got to get up,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe measure of a person or a party is how fast they get back up.\u201d",
      "Harris, who stepped in as the party's presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign in July following his disastrous debate performance, praised donors for putting their time \u2014 and checkbooks \u2014 into backing her and Democrats that they believed in.",
      "Democrats, their allied super PACs and other groups raised about $2.9 billion, compared to about $1.8 billion for the Republicans. Harris noted that Democrats raised a whopping $700 million over just 700 events organized by the Democratic finance committee.",
      "\u201cYou rallied, you opened your homes, you reached out to your friends and your family,\u201d said Harris, who will soon begin weighing in earnest her own future and whether to make another White House run. \u201cYou put your personal capital \u2014 and by that I mean your relationships \u2014 at stake to talk with people because you care so deeply, and you connected with people and took the time to remind them of what is at stake and what was at stake.\u201d",
      "While Biden acknowledged the sting that Democrats continue to feel about last month's loss, he said they should take pride in what they accomplished.",
      "The administration's signature achievements include a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., and a surge in federal environmental spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic votes.",
      "\u201cWe could never have gotten as much done as we did without you,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou not only contributed to the campaign, but you did something, I think, even more important. You were willing to lend your names, your reputation, your character to the effort.\u201d",
      "Biden said that he intended to remain engaged with party politics once he leaves office on Jan. 20. He also predicted that he expected Harris would remain a central character in the party's future.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere kid. We aren\u2019t letting you,\u201d Biden said to Harris."

      "Former South Carolina congressman John Spratt has died at the age of 82",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- John Spratt, a former longtime Democratic congressman from South Carolina who successfully pushed for a balanced budget deal in the 1990s but was unseated decades later when his district turned Republican, has died. He was 82.",
      "Spratt died Saturday night at home, surrounded by family, due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, his daughter, Catherine Spratt, said in a post on Facebook.",
      "Tributes quickly poured in for Spratt, who represented South Carolina\u2019s 5th District for nearly 30 years.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton hailed Spratt as a \u201cskilled and deeply principled lawmaker\u201d who was willing to work with anyone to pass legislation to make a difference in people\u2019s lives.",
      "In a condolence letter to the family, according to Spratt's daughter, President Joe Biden wrote that, \u201cGuided by his wit, wisdom, decency and grace, John deeply understood the promise of America, and he fought tirelessly to bring people together to help us live up to that promise.\"",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, in a post on X, called Spratt a man of \u201cunmatched intellect, integrity, and kindness,\u201d and said he would order flags across the state to be lowered to half-staff on the day of Spratt's funeral.",
      "Christale Spain, chair of South Carolina's Democratic Party, said in a news release that Spratt \u201cearned respect on both sides of the aisle, and he will be remembered for his courageous work to enhance and improve healthcare, support for our military, and his strengthening of rural communities leaves a lasting impact that will be felt for generations.\u201d",
      "Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native, said he \u201coften teased that Mr. Spratt had probably forgotten more about the federal budget than the majority of Members had ever known,\u201d calling him \u201cbrilliant, kind, and beloved by many.\u201d",
      "First elected to Congress in 1982, Spratt rose through the ranks to become chairman of the House Budget Committee and the second-highest-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.",
      "One of his proudest accomplishments, his daughter said, was his role in passing the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful for the chance to work with him, especially on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which he co-authored and helped produce record surpluses,\u201d Clinton said. \"John was a true public servant and a really good man.\u201d",
      "As much of the South tilted toward the GOP, Spratt hung on to his congressional seat, fending off challengers as Republicans redrew congressional maps in their favor.",
      "Spratt's district had been in Democratic hands for more than 100 years until Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated Spratt in a 2010 race for the seat. Mulvaney held it for three terms before going on to serve President Donald Trump's first administration as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and for more than a year, as acting White House chief of staff.",
      "South Carolina now has six Republicans and one Democrat \u2014 Rep. Jim Clyburn, who recently won his 17th term representing the state's 6th District \u2014 in its U.S. House delegation. Only one other district, the 1st, was briefly won by a Democrat before reverting to Republican hands.",
      "\"Serving in Congress with John Spratt was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life,\" Clyburn wrote in a post on X, calling his former colleague \u201ca friend and confidant, a colleague and counselor, and a mentor and partner,\u201d as well as \u201can inconspicuous genius and the most ordinary, extraordinary person I have ever known.\u201d",
      "Spratt graduated from Davidson College, where he was student body president. Winning a Marshall Scholarship to Oxford, he studied economics, and earned a law degree from Yale. Spratt was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal after serving as a captain in the Army from 1969 to 1971, coming home to South Carolina that year to practice law with his father.",
      "Eleven years later, he was elected to his first U.S. House term.",

      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is urging the federal government to deploy advanced drone-tracking technology following weeks of reported drone sightings in parts of New York and New Jersey that have stirred fear and bewilderment",
      "BOSTON -- After weeks of fear and bewilderment about the drones buzzing over parts of New York and New Jersey, elected officials are urging action to identify and stop the mysterious flights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "\u201c'We don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer,\u201d he said.",
      "National security officials have said the drones don\u2019t appear to be a sign of foreign interference or a public safety threat. But because they can\u2019t say with certainty who is responsible for the sudden swarms of drones over parts of New Jersey, New York and other eastern parts of the U.S. \u2014 or how they can be stopped \u2014 leaders of both political parties are demanding better technology and powers to deal with the drones.",
      "Sen. Chuck Schumer called Sunday for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to deploy better drone-tracking technology to identify the drones and their operators.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers have tremendous questions about it,\u201d Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters about the drone sightings. \u201cWe are going to get the answers for them.\u201d",
      "The federal government did little to answer those questions in its own media briefings Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "Some of the drones reported above parts of New York and New Jersey have turned out to be \u201cmanned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the Northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter.\u201d",
      "Last year, federal aviation rules began requiring certain drones to broadcast their remote identification, including the location of their operators. It\u2019s not clear whether that information has been used to determine who is behind the drones plaguing locations over New York and New Jersey. Mayorkas\u2019 office didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether they\u2019ve been able to identify drones using this capability.",
      "Schumer wants the federal government to use a recently declassified radio wave technology in New York and New Jersey. The radio wave detector can be attached to a drone or airplane and can determine whether another flying object is a bird or a drone, read its electronic registration, and follow it back to its landing place. Schumer said state and local authorities do not have the authority to track drones.",
      "On Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said federal officials were sending a drone detection system to the state.",
      "\u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The governor did not immediately provide additional details, including where the system will be deployed.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month over parts of New Jersey, raising concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Drones are now being reported all along the northern East Coast, with suspicious sightings in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to news reports.",
      "Some U.S. political leaders, including Trump, have called for much stronger action against the drones, including shooting them down.",
      "Certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security have the power to \u201cincapacitate\u201d drones, Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cBut we need those authorities expanded,\u201d he said.",
      "A bill before the U.S. Senate would enhance some federal agencies\u2019 authority and give new abilities to local and state agencies to track drones. It would also start a pilot program allowing states and local authorities to disrupt, disable or seize a drone without prior consent of the operator.",
      "\u201cWhat the drone issue points out are gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department,\" Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s pick to be his national security adviser, said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \"Americans are finding it hard to believe we can\u2019t figure out where these are coming from.\u2019\u2019",

    "story": [
      "Ohio's Republican secretary of state and attorney general sought to reassure voters before the November election that the state's elections were being vigorously protected against the possibility of immigrants voting illegally",
      "AKRON, Ohio -- Before the November presidential election, Ohio's secretary of state and attorney general announced investigations into potential voter fraud that included people suspected of casting ballots even though they were not U.S. citizens.",
      "It coincided with a national Republican messaging strategy warning that potentially thousands of ineligible voters would be voting.",
      "\u201cThe right to vote is sacred,\u201d Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, said in a statement at the time. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a U.S. citizen, it\u2019s illegal to vote -\u2013 whether you thought you were allowed to or not. You will be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In the end, their efforts led to just a handful of cases. Of the 621 criminal referrals for voter fraud that Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent to the attorney general, prosecutors have secured indictments against nine people for voting as noncitizens over the span of 10 years \u2014 and one was later found to have died. That total is a tiny fraction of Ohio's 8 million registered voters and the tens of millions of ballots cast during that period.",
      "The outcome and the stories of some of those now facing charges illustrate the gap \u2014 both in Ohio and across the United States \u2014 between the rhetoric about noncitizen voting and the reality: It's rare, is caught and prosecuted when it does happen and does not occur as part of a coordinated scheme to throw elections.",
      "The Associated Press attended in-person and virtual court hearings for three of the Ohio defendants over the past two weeks. Each of the cases involved people with long ties to their community who acted alone, often under a mistaken impression they were eligible to vote. They now find themselves facing felony charges and possible deportation.",
      "Among them is Nicholas Fontaine, a 32-year-old precision sheet metal worker from Akron. He was indicted in October on one count of illegal voting, a fourth-degree felony.",
      "Fontaine is a Canadian-born permanent resident who moved to the U.S. with his mother and sister when he was 2 years old. He is facing a possible jail term and deportation on allegations that he voted in the 2016 and 2018 elections.",
      "He recalls being a college student when he was approached on the street about registering to vote.",
      "\u201cI think in my young teenage brain, I thought, \u2018Well, I have to sign up for the draft, I should be able to vote,\u2019\u201d Fontaine said in an interview.",
      "Permanent residents such as Fontaine are just one of several categories of immigrants who must register for a potential military draft through the Selective Service but who cannot legally vote.",
      "Fontaine said he received a postcard from the local board of elections in 2016 informing him of his polling place. He voted without issue. He even showed his ID before receiving his ballot.",
      "\u201cNo problems. Went in, voted, turned my voter stuff in, that was it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no, like, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s an issue here,\u2019 or, \u2018There\u2019s a thing here.\u2019 Just, here\u2019s your paper (ballot).\u201d",
      "Fontaine said a Department of Homeland Security official visited him at his home in either 2018 or 2019, alerted him to the fact that his votes in 2016 and 2018 had been illegal and warned him not to vote again. Since then, he never has. That's one reason why his indictment this fall came as a shock.",
      "He said he never received notice that he was indicted and missed his court hearing in early December, being informed of the charges only when an AP reporter knocked on his door after the scheduled hearing and told him.",
      "Fontaine said he was raised in a household where his American stepfather taught him the value of voting. He said he would never have cast an illegal vote intentionally.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know any person, even like Americans I\u2019ve talked to about voting, who would consider illegally voting for any reason,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, why would you do that? It doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re going to find out \u2014 clearly, they\u2019re going to find out. And it\u2019s turning one vote into two. Even doing that, can you get a hundred? There\u2019s how many millions of voters in America?\u201d",
      "Faith Lyon, the Portage County election director, said local officials in the county where Fontaine is charged would not have had any way to independently verify his immigration status. Each voter registration form includes a checkbox asking whether a person is a U.S. citizen or not and explaining that people cannot vote unless they are, she said.",
      "In two other illegal voting cases moving through the Ohio courts, the defendants left that box unchecked, according to their lawyers, believing the omission would result in the election board not registering them if they were indeed ineligible. Yet they were registered anyway, and now face criminal prosecution for voting.",
      "A day before Fontaine\u2019s scheduled hearing, one of those defendants, 40-year-old Fiona Allen, wept outside a Cleveland courtroom when a public defender explained the charges she faced.",
      "She had moved to the U.S. from Jamaica nine years ago. After turning in the voter registration form and receiving her registration, Allen voted in 2020, 2022 and 2023, prosecutors say. The mother of two, including a son in the U.S. Navy, and her husband of 13 years, a naturalized citizen who also is a serviceman, declined to comment at the courthouse. Allen has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Another, 78-year-old Lorinda Miller, appeared before a judge over Zoom last week. She appeared shell-shocked about facing charges.",
      "Her attorney said Miller, who arrived in the U.S. from Canada as a child, is affiliated with an Indigenous tribe that issued her paperwork identifying her as \u201ca citizen of North America.\u201d She was told that was sufficient to allow her to register and vote. She\u2019s even been called for jury duty, said lawyer Reid Yoder.",
      "He plans to take the case to trial after Miller pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "\u201cI think the integrity of the vote should be protected, wholeheartedly,\u201d Yoder said. \u201cI think the intent of the law is to punish people who defrauded the system. That is not my client. To really defraud the system, you have to know you\u2019re doing it. My client\u2019s nothing like that. She believes in the sanctity of the vote, which is why she participated. She didn\u2019t know she was doing anything wrong.\u201d",
      "The Ohio cases are just one example of what is true nationally \u2014 that the narrative of widespread numbers of immigrants without the necessary legal documents registering to vote and then voting is simply not backed up by the facts, said Jay Young, senior director of the Voting and Democracy Program for Common Cause.",
      "State voter rolls are cleaned regularly, he said, and the penalties for casting an illegal ballot as a noncitizen are severe: fines, the potential for a prison sentence and deportation.",
      "He said the role of such immigrants and their potential to sway the election \u201cwas the most enduring false narrative that we saw throughout this election.\" But he also said it served a purpose, to keep the country divided and sow distrust in the election system.",
      "\u201cIf your guy doesn\u2019t win or you're a candidate that doesn\u2019t win, you have an excuse that you can tell yourself to justify it,\u201d he said.",

      "Indiana officials are preparing to execute the state\u2019s first death row inmate in 15 years",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana officials are preparing to execute the state's first death row inmate in 15 years, who was convicted a quarter-century ago of killing his brother and three other men.",
      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, has been on Indiana's death row since 1999. If he is put to death as scheduled Wednesday, it will be the state's first execution since 2009. In that time, 13 executions were carried out in Indiana but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison.",
      "Corcoran is scheduled to be executed before sunrise Wednesday at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Chicago.",
      "Indiana's resumption of executions is refocusing attention on Corcoran's case and questions about how the state has been able to obtain a drug for lethal injections.",
      "Corcoran was 22 on July 26, 1997, when he fatally shot his brother, 30-year-old James Corcoran, and three other men: Douglas A. Stillwell, 30, Timothy G. Bricker, 30, and Robert Scott Turner, 32.",
      "According to court records, Joseph Corcoran was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, home he had shared with his brother and sister.",
      "He awoke to hear his brother and others downstairs talking about him, loaded his rifle and then shot all four men, records show.",
      "While jailed, Corcoran reportedly bragged about shooting his parents in 1992 in northern Indiana's Steuben County. He was charged in their killings but acquitted.",
      "Corcoran's sister, Kelly Ernst, who lost a brother and her fianc\u00e9 in the 1997 shootings, declined to discuss whether she believes her younger brother killed their parents.",
      "But Ernst, who lives in northeastern Indiana, said she believes the death penalty should be abolished and her brother\u2019s execution won\u2019t solve or change anything. She does not plan to attend his execution.",
      "Ernst said she had been out of contact with her brother for 10 years until recently. She believes it\u2019s \u201cfairly obvious\u201d he has a serious mental illness.",
      "\u201cI kind of just feel that there\u2019s no such thing as closure,\" Ernst, 56, said Friday. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what else to say. I haven\u2019t slept in weeks.\u201d",
      "Indiana last executed Matthew Wrinkles, who was put to death in 2009 for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994.",
      "State officials said they couldn't continue executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable. There has been a yearslong nationwide shortage because pharmaceutical companies \u2014 particularly in Europe, where opposition to capital punishment is strongest \u2014 have refused to sell their products for that purpose.",
      "That has prompted states to turn to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs specifically for a client. Some states have switched to more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause excruciating pain.",
      "Indiana is following that lead, planning to use pentobarbital to execute Corcoran.",
      "The federal government also used pentobarbital in the 13 federal executions carried out during the final six months of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Many states, including Indiana, refuse to divulge where they get the drugs. When asked how the state obtained the pentobarbital it plans to use in Corcoran\u2019s execution, the Indiana Department of Correction directed The Associated Press to a state law labeling the source of lethal injection drugs as confidential.",
      "In June, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced the state had acquired pentobarbital and asked the Indiana Supreme Court to set a date for Corcoran\u2019s execution. The high court set his Dec. 18 execution date in September.",
      "State law lays out the specific timing and process. It also limits the people who have a role in an execution and shields their identities and specifies who can witness executions at the Indiana State Prison.",
      "At the time of an execution, Indiana code states that the only people allowed to be present are the prison warden, those selected to assist in the execution, the prison physician, one additional physician, the condemned person's spiritual adviser and the prison chaplain.",
      "Up to five friends or relatives of the person being executed and up to eight relatives of the victims of the crime are allowed to view the process.",
      "The Indiana Department of Correction did not respond to multiple queries from the AP asking whether any of the staffers who will help carry out Corcoran\u2019s execution have previously taken part in a state execution.",
      "Indiana is one of only two states, along with Wyoming, that do not allow for members of the news media to witness state executions, according to a recent report by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "That report states \u201cunobstructed media access to exe\u00adcu\u00adtions is crit\u00adi\u00adcal because the media observes what the pub\u00adlic can\u00adnot. States gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adly pro\u00adhib\u00adit cit\u00adi\u00adzens from attend\u00ading exe\u00adcu\u00adtions, so the media becomes the public\u2019s watch\u00addog, pro\u00advid\u00ading impor\u00adtant infor\u00adma\u00adtion about how the gov\u00adern\u00adment is fol\u00adlow\u00ading the law and using tax\u00adpay\u00ader funds.\u201d",
      "Corcoran had exhausted his federal appeals in 2016.",
      "His attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but were denied on Dec. 5. The high court also denied petitions to argue whether he is competent to be executed.",
      "In a handwritten affidavit to the justices, Corcoran said he no longer wanted to litigate his case.",
      "\u201cI am guilty of the crime I was convicted of, and accept the findings of all the appellate courts,\u201d he wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, his attorneys filed a petition in U.S. District Court of Northern Indiana asking the court to stop his execution and hold a hearing to decide if it would be unconstitutional because Corcoran has a serious mental illness.",
      "They argued he has \u201csevere and longstanding paranoid schizophrenia\u201d and his condition \u201cmanifests as auditory hallucinations and delusions that prison guards are torturing him with an ultrasound machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndeed, he has volunteered to be executed, and is eager to be executed, because he believes his execution will give him relief from the perceived pain his delusions and hallucinations inflict upon him,\u201d the filing states.",
      "But on Friday, the federal district court declined to intervene, prompting defense attorneys to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.",
      "There's also the possibility that outgoing Gov. Eric Holcomb, who has said he would let the legal process \u201cplay out,\u201d could step in.",
      "Indiana Disability Rights, a disability rights organization, asked Holcomb in a Dec. 6 letter to commute the death sentence to life in prison without parole.",
      "\u201cExecuting individuals who cannot fully comprehend their circumstances, or the consequences of their actions, violates fundamental principles of human dignity and equity,\u201d the letter said.",

      "He sidles up behind passengers and gives them a good sniff. If he gets a whiff of anything suspicious, he immediately alerts his handler, transportation security specialist Jonathan Lilly. The two are gearing up for a busy holiday travel season.",
      "\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me what he can do,\u201d Lilly said during a recent demonstration of Argo\u2019s skills. \u201cHe\u2019s just so good at it.\u201d",
      "Argo is one of 12 dogs featured in a 2025 TSA canine calendar. For his portrait, he is pictured against an American flag backdrop, his expression eager, almost as if someone were holding his beloved ball just outside the frame.",
      "When he is not posing, Argo has the serious job protecting U.S. air travelers. During the demonstration, he was presented with a \u201cdecoy\u201d involving a person wearing a backpack containing something that smelled like potential explosives.",
      "As the man joined other passengers and walked casually toward the security line, Argo immediately reacted to the scent by dropping his nose to the ground, wagging his tail faster and pulling his handler toward the target. He was quickly rewarded with his favorite toy, a tennis ball on a string.",
      "Argo celebrated his accomplishment as usual by flinging the toy around and Lilly rewarded him further with a quick game of tug-of-war. His tail almost never stops wagging. He saunters happily through the throngs of people and luggage, being a good boy.",
      "The pair have been working together for seven years. They are based out of BWI, but have traveled to recent Super Bowls and other locations to provide support. Lilly said he plans to adopt Argo when he retires, but that is likely years away.",
      "\u201cEven at 9 years old, he\u2019s still like a puppy. He still wants to work,\u201d Lilly said.",
      "He said they were a good team from day one, but their bond has only gotten stronger over the years.",
      "TSA dogs are highly trained to detect air currents trailing behind people, like the wake created by a boat, officials said. Their sense of smell is so good they can smell individual components. While humans might register the aroma of pizza, dogs might smell the cheese, sauce and crust separately.",
      "The agency\u2019s explosive detection dogs are trained at the National TSA Canine Training Center in San Antonio, where Argo was assigned to Lilly. The team completed a 16-week program before starting their assignment at BWI. They still undergo frequent training and testing to keep Argo on top of his game.",
      "\u201cThat way we can make sure he\u2019s staying proficient in what he\u2019s doing. But also to try to advance because it\u2019s a perishable skill,\u201d Lilly said.",
      "He said having explosives detection dogs patrolling airports serves to both detect and deter potential threats.",
      "When he isn\u2019t working, Argo spends most of his free time napping.",
      "Lilly said the black Lab is incredibly laid-back at home. As a government employee, Argo eats a strict diet for his health. Like many of his human friends, he looks forward to a good meal after a hard day\u2019s work.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as an envoy for special missions",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he's picked longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as an envoy for special missions, tasking him with helping the incoming administration deal with some of the toughest foreign policy challenges.",
      "Grenell served as ambassador to Germany during Trump\u2019s first administration, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and did a stint as acting director of national intelligence.",
      "He was also a contender to serve as secretary of state, but Trump opted to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.",
      "\u201cRic will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea,\u201d Trump said in a posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, announcing the appointment.",
      "Grenell during Trump's first term developed a reputation for employing a sometimes contentious approach to diplomacy that rankled allies and the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But his style was appreciated by the president-elect who sees value in blunt talk with allies.",
      "Grenell remained close to Trump after he left office in 2021, serving at times as a key adviser on foreign policy.",
      "He was in the room when Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September. Grenell has advocated for a peace deal that would preserve Ukraine\u2019s territory while still allowing for \u201cautonomous regions\u201d where Russia could remain in control.",
      "He\u2019s also advised against expanding NATO to include Ukraine, saying \u2014 as Trump has \u2014 that the alliance shouldn\u2019t grow until current members meet the alliance's defense spending targets. Members of the transatlantic alliance have committed for years to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries still fall short of the target.",
      "He was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and held multiple events for the Republican nominee focused on economics and national security.",
      "Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Grenell echoed Trump\u2019s mantra that \u201cit\u2019s time to put America first\u201d on the global stage and argued that China and Russia saw President Joe Biden's administration as weak.",
      "Trump raised concerns among some allies during the 2024 campaign when he said he would not defend NATO members that failed to meet defense spending targets, and warned he would \u201cencourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d to alliance countries that he considered \u201cdelinquent.\u201d",
      "Grenell has downplayed Trump's criticisms of NATO and said the only talk of leaving the alliance altogether \u201cwas really from the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, don\u2019t come to the wedding without a gift,\u201d Grenell said.",
      "Grenell was part of the Trump campaign's outreach to Arab American voters in Michigan, where the president-elect made gains with a traditionally Democratic constituency despite his history of banning immigration from several majority-Muslim countries. Grenell orchestrated pro-Trump events with Arab American voters, including a May meeting held in Troy, Michigan.",
      "A U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration, Grenell, like many other Republicans, has his own history of criticizing Trump before embracing him.",
      "Once an adviser to GOP moderates like 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a supporter of gay marriage, Grenell, who is openly gay, deleted social media posts blasting Trump as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d once the former reality TV star became the Republican nominee in 2016.",
      "Trump also announced Saturday that he\u2019s appointing Devin Nunes, the chief executive officer of the president-elect's Truth Social platform, to head a presidential advisory board that will keep tabs on the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "Nunes will continue leading Trump Media & Technology Group. Trump is the company\u2019s largest shareholder.",
      "The former California lawmaker chaired the House Intelligence Committee and was one of Trump\u2019s closest allies in Congress during the president-elect's first term.",

      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks requiring Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "\u201cWhen you're moving with a bunch of books, you're not examining every book. You throw them in a box and go,\u201d said Hildebrandt, who has lived in many cities. \u201cBut five or six years ago, I was going through the bookshelf and there was a Dewey decimal library number on the book. What is this?\u201d",
      "Inside the book was a slip of paper indicating that it was due back at the Warren library on Dec. 4, 1974. Hildebrandt told The Associated Press that he decided to keep the book until 2024 \u2014 the 50th anniversary \u2014 and then try to return it. He figured the library might want to publicize the long overdue exchange.",
      "He said he recently met library director Oksana Urban, who listened to his pitch. Hildebrandt said he hasn't heard anything since then, though Urban told the Detroit Free Press that all is forgiven.",
      "\"Some people never come back to face the music,\u201d she said of patrons with overdue books. \u201cBut there was really no music to face because he and the book were erased from our system.\u201d",
      "So \u201cBaseball\u2019s Zaniest Stars\u201d is back on Hildebrandt's shelf. In return, he's now trying to raise $4,564 for Reading is Fundamental, a nonprofit literacy group. The amount roughly represents a 50-year overdue library fine. Hildebrandt is seeding the effort with $457."

      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "The settlement agreement was signed Friday, the same day a Florida federal judge ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for separate depositions in the case next week. The settlement means that sworn testimony is no longer required.",
      "The agreement bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "Falling turkey and Brussels sprout prices mean Christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year.",
      "The price of Brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you \u00a31.21 less than it did last year, research for the BBC suggests.",
      "But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.",
      "When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost \u00a331.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of \u00a332.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased.",
      "Turkey and Brussels sprouts cheaper",
      "The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.",
      "The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.",
      "Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.",
      "\"Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,\" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957.",
      "However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts.",
      "\"It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down.\"",
      "Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year.",
      "Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.",
      "But he says this year has seen us return \"back to normality\" after \"a couple of tricky seasons\" and sprouts are thriving again.",
      "A tough planting season for root vegetables",
      "Root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our Christmas shop.",
      "Maris Piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from \u00a31.58 to \u00a31.99.",
      "Tracy Bush, co-director of Provenance Potatoes in Kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years.",
      "\"We've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,\" she says.",
      "Carrot farmer Rodger Hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. Last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. This year, they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo.",
      "But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if \"when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo\".",
      "This is because carrots are often chosen as \"loss leaders\" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items.",
      "Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.",
      "\"Every year they do the same thing,\" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price \"potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts\".",
      "Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says.",
      "While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices \"don't show the true cost to the farmer\" and can generate a lot of food waste.",
      "\"People think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true.\"",
      "This year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of Christmas desserts also went up.",

      "How do supermarkets compare?",
      "BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop.",
      "We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi.",

      "Asda was second cheapest at \u00a328.22, followed by Morrisons and Sainsbury's.",
      "Tesco was most expensive at \u00a336.51. Last year, our research suggested Morrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third.",
      "While we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. So the cost of your Christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose.",
      "Prices will also vary the closer we get to Christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce.",
      "Our BBC analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm Assosia as we both use a slightly different basket.",

      "The vacancy figure was now 26% lower than a year ago, he said, a \"significant decline\".",

      "While still moderate by historical standards, unemployment ticked up to 4.3% in September, compared to 4% in the period March to May.",

      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",

      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",

    "summary": "Builders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.",
    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "1,200 tilers",
      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

      "\"Letter delays leave millions of people missing urgent medical appointment letters, legal documents and benefit decisions,\" said Tom MacInnes, its director of policy.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

    "summary": "The US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump stood on Wall Street on Thursday, a euphoric crowd of America's business elite assembled before him, and hammered the bell to kick off morning stock market trading.",
      "The mood was celebratory. Not only had the president-elect just been named Time person of the year, but the stock market, already up strongly, has surged to new heights since his election.",
      "For Trump, whose public appearances have been relatively sparing since his election win last month, the visit was a reminder of the high value he places on market opinion.",
      "But whether history will look back on his appearance as the well-timed heralding of another economic boom - or a death knell - remains to be seen.",
      "Trump is entering office with a US economy that is, in the recent words of America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell, the envy of many other countries, with solid growth of 2.8%, unemployment near historic lows of 4.2% and that mysterious ingredient known as \"productivity\" on a tear.",
      "It has combined to push American stocks to record levels: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to end the year up more than 17%.",
      "The S&P 500, a bigger index made up of America's 500 largest companies, has surged 28% since January, while the Nasdaq, where tech firms have a major presence, has rallied more than 40%.",
      "Investors are hoping for more, with the Trump administration expected to loosen regulations and green-light takeovers that might have come under harsh review during President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "At the stock exchange on Thursday,  a who's who of the business world, including Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and Target chief Brian Cornell, had assembled. The president-elect was greeted with sustained applause and whistles, which later gave way to chants of \"USA! USA!\"",
      "His visit marked a relatively rare appearance by a sitting or former president.",
      "But analysts have warned that current highs may be difficult to sustain in the year ahead.",
      "Job creation is already slowing and price inflation is proving stubborn.",
      "Many of Trump's priorities - including slashing government spending, erecting stiff, broad-based trade barriers and embarking on mass deportations of migrants - if enacted, could pose further challenges to growth.",
      "Though debate is ongoing about how much the president actually will do, the proposals are generating uncertainty and have the potential for significant disruption, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.",
      "\"The totality of the policies, if implemented to the degree that the president has articulated, I think will be problematic for the economy,\" he said.",
      "At the stock exchange on Thursday, Trump kept his comments focused on other parts of his agenda more palatable to markets: his promises to lower taxes from 21% to 15% for businesses manufacturing in America, cut regulation and speed up government approvals.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant - I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think?\" he said, to laughter.",
      "Similar policies, which Zandi said would be good for the corporate bottom line, if not necessarily the economy, boosted share prices significantly during Trump's first term.",
      "He cited those gains repeatedly as a sign of his administration's success, especially at the start.",
      "But the market retreated during trade wars with allies and with China - then nose-dived at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before rapidly recovering.",
      "Ultimately, the S&P 500 gained more than 67% on his watch - a record bested by presidents Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Barack Obama during his first four years.",
      "Under Biden, the index has risen 59% so far. Whether Trump can repeat that performance is something he has declined to predict.",
      "The main US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq dipping by around 0.5%.",
      "Asked at the stock exchange what investors should be buying in anticipation of the future, Trump, somewhat uncharacteristically, demurred.",
      "\"I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something\", he said, then added, \"Long term, this is going to be a country like no other.\""

      "A British hedge fund trader has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in Denmark, after being found guilty of orchestrating a tax fraud that cost the Danish government more than \u00a31bn.",
      "It is the heaviest penalty ever given out in Denmark for a fraud case.",
      "In addition to the prison term, financier Sanjay Shah, who was the founder of London-based hedge fund Solo Capital Partners, received a permanent entry ban to Denmark and will have assets worth $1bn (DKK 7.2bn) seized, as well as a string of properties.",

      "Seated between his lawyers, the 54-year-old Briton was calm and straight-faced as a judge read out the verdict.",
      "Nanna Blach told the court that Shah had played a \"completely central and controlling role\" in a scheme that had led to \"unjust\" payments, adding that the crime had been \"meticulously planned and organised\".",

      "Shah had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, arguing that he had used a legal loophole. His defence attorneys had tried several times to get the case dismissed.",
      "Danish prosecutor Marie Tullin told the BBC that the maximum sentence given to Shah reflected, \"the extraordinarily big amount, the time it had gone on, and his role in it managing it all, over several years committing this fraud against the Danish state.\"",
      "\"It is by far the largest [fraud] in terms of amount,\" she added. \"I think also the sentence speaks for itself, in that it is a crime haven't seen in this magnitude before.\"",
      "Before his arrest, Shah had been living in Dubai, where he was reportedly known for throwing lavish parties and had hosted concerts for his autism charity, with performances by major celebrities.",
      "He was arrested in 2022 and extradited from the United Arab Emirates to Denmark in December last year.",
      "According to Reuters, so-called cum-ex trading schemes have flourished since the 2008 financial crisis, with Germany, Belgium, and Denmark among the European countries most affected.",
      "The schemes typically involve the rapid sale of large volumes of shares from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend, enabling duplicated claims of the withholding tax.",
      "Previously the Danish government has said cum-ex schemes have cost it more than $1.8bn (12.7bn DKK). Shah was one of nine British and US nationals accused of defrauding the state.",
      "Shah also faces a parallel civil tax fraud case in London, filed by the Danish tax authority, that is due to conclude in April.",
      "As he exited the court escorted by police officers, wearing his Santa Claus hat once more, Shah shot a smile towards reporters, and said, \"See you next year.\""

    "story": [
      "Energy firms will be forced to offer customers tariffs with no standing charges, under a proposed shake-up of bills by regulator Ofgem.",
      "All households pay the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, but there have been widespread calls for these fees to be scrapped.",
      "Ofgem is proposing suppliers offer one price-capped tariff that includes the standing charge, and another that loads these costs on energy usage charges instead. Customers could choose which suits them best.",
      "The planned overhaul, for next winter, also raises the possibility of some unpaid bills that built up during a recent high-price crisis to be written off.",
      "Standing charge anger",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",
      "The majority were against standing charges - fixed fees, typically totalling more than \u00a3300 a year, that are paid irrespective of how much energy households use.",
      "Under Ofgem's price cap, standing charges have risen by 43% since 2019.",
      "Those with low energy usage, such as people who live alone, argued that even if they further reduced how much gas and electricity they used, they saw little difference in their bills. They wanted more control over their bills.",
      "However, those with high energy needs could see a big rise in bills were these charges to be included in the price of each unit of energy used. It would mean higher bills for people with disabilities who have to charge up specialist equipment.",
      "\"We hear from people who've turned off their heating, ration their hot water, and avoid charging essential mobility devices, yet still feel like they're fighting a losing battle with their energy bills,\" said Alex Belsham-Harris from Citizens Advice.",
      "Ofgem's proposed solution is to tell energy firms to make a dual pricing offer - one with, and one without, a standing charge. The tariff without a standing charge would have a higher price for each unit of energy. Both would fall under the existing price cap system.",
      "Such tariffs already exist, but only from a handful of suppliers and are not available to everyone.",
      "Customers would need to make a choice, but some campaigners want those with low energy use to automatically move on to a deal free of standing charges.",
      "\"The problem with presenting a choice of price caps is many vulnerable people won't make that choice,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert.",
      "One of those who could benefit would be Joanne Wilkinson.",
      "\"I try not to look [at the standing charges] because it's depressing,\" she said.",
      "She said she had enough to worry about dealing with baby daughter Adeline, but noticed how quickly the meter goes through the money that was loaded on to it.",
      "Lower wages in the north of England made it even harder for parents like her to afford energy bills, she said, especially as she was still on maternity leave.",
      "But Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that such a fundamental proposed change needed careful consideration.",
      "\"It would be a major undertaking to make all customers aware of this change and to ensure they then choose the best option for their circumstances,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Dhara Vyas.",
      "She told the BBC the addition of a zero standing charge price cap option would \"quite significantly change the nature of the price cap\".",
      "\"It would go from being one single regulated price that gives customers protection whether or not they switch, to a situation where I think customers might be expected to make an active choice about which cap they are on.\"",
      "Asked whether standing charges should be scrapped altogether, Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told the BBC the option had been looked at, but added the costs \"need to appear in bills somewhere\".",
      "He said moving costs into unit rates could have \"some quite bad effects on people in some of the most vulnerable situations\".",
      "The regulator's proposals do not deal with the variation of standing charges in different parts of the UK, with billpayers in some areas paying considerably more. Ofgem intends to make that part of a wider, separate inquiry.",
      "Debt repayment plan",
      "The amount of money owed to suppliers by customers has nearly doubled in two years, now totalling about \u00a33.8bn.",
      "The regulator is also setting out a plan for next winter that would deal with some of this debt, built up during a period of high prices, that has little chance of being repaid.",
      "It is planning a \"debt guarantee\" to improve the standard of service offered by suppliers supporting customers in debt, which it said would give households \"consistent, compassionate and tailored support\".",
      "Suppliers could also be required to accept debt repayment offers from reputable third parties such as debt advice agencies or consumer organisations."

      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",

      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",

      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",

      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",

      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",

Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",

      "Comedian Chris McCausland has won the 22nd series of Strictly Come Dancing after beating 14 other celebrities to this year's glitterball trophy.",
      "He has been praised throughout the series for defying expectations of what a blind person can achieve on the dancefloor.",
      "McCausland, 47, was registered blind after losing his sight to retinitis pigmentosa in his 20s.",
      "But who is the man who has charmed viewers of the Saturday night dancing competition?",
      "'I got the stand-up bug'",
      "McCausland was born in 1977 in Liverpool, but moved to south-west London in the mid-1990s to study software engineering at Kingston University.",
      "After graduating, he became a software developer, but had to change careers when his eyesight deteriorated.",
      "He told the i newspaper in 2023 that he had lost his sight completely by the age of 22, from a hereditary condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which his grandmother and mother also had.",
      "His condition means the light sensitive cells of his retinas gradually deteriorated until he could no longer see.",

      "Strictly winners crowned in glitzy live final",
      "\"Basically, I'd been going blind very slowly since I was born, and so didn't even really notice it happening - like the frog in the pan of boiling water,\" he said.",
      "His next job was in sales, which was \"really boring stuff\" and \"just filling the time until I figured out what I properly wanted to do\", he told the Liverpool Echo in 2016.",
      "The turning point came when McCausland was 26.",
      "\"I got shingles and was signed off from work for two weeks,\" he said.",
      "\"I was bored out of my head and as a dare from myself I decided to have a go at stand-up.\"",
      "That first comedy gig went so well that he got \"the stand-up bug\", he said, and he's been doing it ever since.",
      "He went on to compete in several new talent competitions and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe for six years between 2005 and 2012.",
      "His TV career began in 2006 when he became one of the main characters in CBeebies show Me Too!, playing a blind market trader called Rudi.",
      "Comedy producers also started recognising his talent. He appeared in Paramount series At The Comedy Store from 2008, and won a Creative Diversity award in 2011 for comedy, which was awarded by a panel of broadcasters including Channel 4, BBC, ITV and Sky.",
      "As he continued to make his name, his inclusion on an episode of BBC One panel show Would I Lie to You? in 2019 prompted a debate about a lack of disability inclusion on British television.",
      "He was no token booking, and his comedy skills also saw him in demand for shows including Live At The Apollo, Have I Got News for You and 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.",
      "Meanwhile, other acting credits include episodes of Jimmy McGovern's Moving On and EastEnders.",
      "'Absolutely spectacular'",
      "Strictly Come Dancing bosses asked McCausland to take part twice, but he turned them down both times because he feared he would be out of his \"comfort zone\".",
      "\"My concern,\" he told the Times in October, \"was that it would be a disaster. I honestly thought it could be a car crash.\"",
      "He was eventually persuaded at the third time of asking, and his fears have been unfounded.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month, he said his participation on the show had been \"extreme\", but he hoped it would \"go some way in stretching people's ideas of what is possible for a person with disabilities\".",
      "He added: \"I think there are low expectations of people with disabilities - sometimes you'll come down a set of steps into a taxi and people say, 'Wow, how did you do that?'\"",
      "He and professional dancer Dianne Buswell became the show's 100th couple to perform at the Blackpool Ballroom - the famous midway point in the series.",

      "Judge Craig Revel Horwood described it as the \"poignant blackout moment\" and \"absolutely spectacular\".",
      "The pair performed the same dance again in the final, along with other routines to You Get What You Give by New Radicals and You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers.",
      "Speaking before the final about his relationship with Buswell, who has reached the final twice before, McCausland said: \"They [Strictly bosses] knew that Dianne would be the best partner for me. In terms of her humour, outlook on life, just the similarities between us and her communication.",
      "\"I think they just knew how good we would work together, so I'm grateful for that.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:44:01 GMT",
    "summary": "All Mariah and Wham! want for Christmas is a chartopper. Can a newcomer like Tom Grennan stop them?",
    "story": [
      "This year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.",
      "Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmas topped the yuletide singles chart, remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot.",
      "As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas.",
      "At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list.",
      "Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.",
      "Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.",
      "Also in this year's mix are Brenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation of Band Aid.",
      "They're joined by a new festive tune by Tom Grennan, while songs by Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson have established themselves as returning Christmas classics.",
      "Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young.",
      "There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.",
      "And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.",
      "\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says.",
      "\"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.",
      "\"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\"",
      "Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.",
      "\"The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,\" Talbot notes.",
      "That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "\"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.",
      "\"Streaming doesn't really work.\" Instead, he says: \"It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.\"",
      "East 17, Reverend and the Makers and The Celebs are all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as are South Yorkshire Fire & Rescue.",
      "Mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020, returning to the summit in 2022.",
      "Yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every December, the unofficial queen of Christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by US authorities) has never been at the top of the UK chart in Christmas week itself.",
      "\"It was the first Christmas song I ever wrote and I was just thinking about all the things that I really did want at Christmas,\" she recently told Rylan in a BBC interview.",
      "\"I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff.\" Aww.",
      "Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists.",
      "In recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019.",
      "This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.",
      "Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a \"no-brainer\" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.",
      "Amazon has also commissioned Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter Laufey's Christmas Magic.",
      "She said being asked to come up with an original to go up against the usual suspects was \"such a fun challenge\".",
      "The classically-trained star's jazzy number features in Red One, a holiday-themed action movie starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans and Lucy Liu - and made by Amazon.",
      "Chart expert James Masterson says the Christmas number one race began as an invention of British bookmakers in 1984.",
      "While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been \"ruined\" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby.",
      "\"It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,\" he says of the LadBaby era.",
      "\"Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.\"",
      "Last Christmas \"won by default\", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing \"the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order\".",
      "'Disaster for the concept'",
      "Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.",
      "Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.",
      "But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to \"achieve enough momentum\" to \"get lucky\".",
      "\"My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,\" he concludes.",
      "So anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the late Liam Payne, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey or Yorkshire Pudding Boy - will probably require a cracking campaign.",
      "There have been upsets in the past - fans of Rage Against the Machine's Killing in the Name put a small-but-welcome dint in the X Factor monopoly in 2009.",
      "Talbot thinks that if Sheeran really \"wanted to really go for it\" with Under The Tree, his song from Richard Curtis's That Christmas movie, he could challenge Wham! and  Mariah.",
      "Alternatively, the \"Wicked phenomenon could be really powerful\", meaning Cynthia Ervivo and Grande's Defying Gravity could pull off a \"surprise\" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema.",
      "US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter has released a Christmas-centric EP, Fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown.",
      "So it's beginning to look a lot like Wham! will be Christmas number one again - just like last Christmas.",
      "This year's Christmas Number 1 will be revealed on 20 December on the Official Chart on Radio with Jack Saunders.",

Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",
      "In an analysis of 15 health-related podcast episodes, BBC World Service found each contained an average of 14 harmful health claims that went against extensive scientific evidence.",
      "Flight Studio - the podcast production company owned by Mr Bartlett - said guests were offered \"freedom of expression\" and were \"thoroughly researched\".",
      "The podcast launched in 2017 focusing on entrepreneurship and business. It soared in popularity as figures such as influencer Molly Mae and Airbnb founder Brian Chesky shared their tips for success.",
      "But in the past 18 months, Mr Bartlett has concentrated more on health, with guests presented as leading experts in their fields. Their views receive little challenge.",
      "The interviews are also posted to Mr Bartlett's YouTube channel, which has seven million subscribers. Since this content shift last year, its monthly views have increased from nine million to 15 million.",
      "Mr Bartlett told The Times in April he expected his podcast to make \u00a320m this year, mainly from advertising.",
      "We looked at the 23 health-related episodes released between April and November this year, fact checking - with four medical experts - 15 which contained potentially harmful claims.",
      "The experts we spoke to were cancer research professor David Grimes, public confidence in healthcare professor Heidi Larson, NHS diabetes adviser Dr Partha Kar and surgeon Dr Liz O'Riordan.",
      "We recorded harmful claims as advice that, if followed, could lead to negative health outcomes.",
      "In that eight-month window, some guests billed as health experts shared accurate information, but most were spreading misleading claims. These included:",

      "Podcasters may claim they are sharing information, but they are actually sharing harmful misinformation, says Dr David Grimes from Trinity College Dublin.",
      "\"That's a very different and not empowering thing. It actually imperils all our health,\" he says.",
      "Podcasts in the UK are not regulated by the media regulator Ofcom - which sets rules on accuracy and impartiality. So Mr Bartlett is not breaking any broadcasting rules.",
      "In a July episode, Mr Bartlett spoke to Aseem Malhotra, a doctor who became known during the pandemic for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines.",
      "In the episode, Dr Malhotra says the \"Covid vaccine was a net negative for society\". Analysis by the World Health Organization shows that it saved many lives during the pandemic.",
      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",
      "In many of the podcast episodes, the guests claimed to know a simple solution to health issues which they believed mainstream institutions were hiding from the public. They often also advertised their products on the podcast.",
      "Cancer researcher Dr Thomas Seyfried appeared on the podcast in October. He is a proponent of using the ketogenic diet, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat, to treat cancer.",
      "But Dr Grimes told us doctors warned patients against restricting their diet while undergoing cancer treatment.",
      "\"You could potentially and very realistically get very, very, sick and have a much worse health outcome than if you followed recommended advice from your oncologists,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast, Dr Seyfried also suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy only improved patients' lifespan by one-to-two months, comparing modern cancer treatments to \"medieval cures\".",
      "Mr Bartlett did not react to this claim.",
      "Cancer Research UK statistics show that UK cancer survival has doubled in the past 50 years. In the US, the cancer death rate has declined 33% since 1990, thanks to modern treatments.",
      "Dr Thomas Seyfried told us he \"stands by the statements that he made in the interview\".",
      "The solutions these guests are offering are appealing to listeners as they feel tangible and come without the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, says Prof Heidi Larson, an expert in public confidence in healthcare.",
      "\"But they [the guests] are way overstretching. It sends people away from evidence-based medicine. They stop doing things that might have some side effects, even though it could save their life.\"",
      "C\u00e9cile Simmons, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a think tank specialising in disinformation research, believes this type of content can help to grow audiences.",
      "\"Health-related clickbait content with scary titles does really well online with the algorithm amplifying that,\" she said.",
      "Mr Bartlett has dabbled in dubious health claims before.",
      "In January, on BBC Two's Dragons' Den - where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch business ideas to five multimillionaire investors, including Mr Bartlett - he invested in \"Ear Seeds\", acupuncture beads placed in the ear which falsely claim to cure chronic fatigue condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).",
      "After complaints, the BBC has since added a disclaimer in the episode and on iPlayer, stating the \"Ear Seeds\" are not intended as a cure, and medical guidance should be followed for ME.",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC declined to comment.",
      "He is also an investor in Huel, a meal replacement company - and Zoe, which sells a personalised nutrition programme involving the use of blood sugar monitors.",
      "\"He has financial stakes in health and wellness companies. And once you have financial interests, you have then the further interest in focusing on health and nutrition,\" says Ms Simmons.",
      "Two Facebook adverts featuring Mr Bartlett were recently banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for promoting two Huel and Zoe products without disclosing he was an investor.",
      "Founders of both companies have previously been invited as guests on The Diary of a CEO podcast.",
      "A spokesperson for Flight Studio, Mr Bartlett's production company said: \"The Diary of a CEO [DOAC] is an open-minded, long-form conversation\u2026 with individuals identified for their distinguished and eminent career and/or consequential life experience.\"",
      "They heard a range of voices, they said, \"not just those Steven and the DOAC team necessarily agree with\".",
      "The BBC investigation had reviewed a \"limited proportion of guests\" out of the nearly 400 broadcast to date, they added."

      "\"We have a real opportunity not just to fund but to story tell,\" says Spotify's global head of social impact, Lauren Wurgraft.",
      "Spotify has drawn criticism from artists over how much they get paid by the platform, and Youth Music says it had to consider that carefully when agreeing to the deal.",

      "The MOBO award winner launched his own scheme to support young people in his area over the summer with funding from Arts Council England, Mirror Mirror.",
      "\"We have huge brands taking a step that will hopefully create a catalyst where other organisations can do the same,\" he says.",

      "The money will be used to protect youth clubs across the UK that are at risk of closure in a bid to get more young people into music.",
      "It follows Youth Music's Sound of the Next Generation report, a survey the charity does every five years, with its latest one asking 2,100 young people about their lives and attitudes towards music.",
      "\"Top of the tree as their favourite thing in their lives is music,\" says Matt.",
      "\"But there was also a contrasting [finding] about access to music getting more limited, particularly access to making music and creating and composing your own music.\"",

      "Meanwhile, research from the YMCA suggests that since 2011, about half of England's youth clubs have closed - rising to 60% in Wales.",
      "The Local Government Association adds that, in that same time, government funding for youth clubs has declined by 73% in real terms.",
      "Shadey says it was \"the last phase of youth clubs\" when he was growing up, describing the centres as little more than a warm space.",
      "\"We felt this was ending, things were closing down, derelict buildings, old PlayStation games, nothing being updated.",
      "\"That's not enough to keep a young person engaged. They want to learn and grow and be a part of something.\"",
      "Lauren agrees that access is a \"huge barrier\".",
      "\"You can dream about being an artist but if you don't actually have a place where you can go and create and learn, then that really is never going to become a reality.\"",
      "The 15 youth hubs which will be receiving the money haven't yet been decided - although according to Matt the funding could be allocated as soon as Christmas.",

      "\"Feeling like they don't belong,\" he says.",
      "Spotify and monetising music",
      "Youth Music's stated mission isn't just to help marginalised young people make music, it's also to help them monetise it.",
      "And Spotify has a reputation - it says an unfair one - for not being very profitable for artists.",
      "The platform pays royalties to copyright holders and while sometimes that's the artist, it often means publishers and labels.",
      "Last year, 1,000 British artists were streamed enough to be paid \u00a3100,000 but on average they would only pocket 16% of what they earn from the app, all while Spotify reports record breaking billion dollar profits.",

      "Copyright holders are also not paid at all if their song is streamed fewer than 1,000 times in a year.",
      "Matt says squaring that with Youth Music's ethos of helping artists monetise their work was something the charity had to \"think about\".",
      "\"The debate about how artists, particularly emerging artists, make a living is very, very live,\" he says.",
      "\"You make a judgement call that in the end, this is going to make a difference for young people and their lives in music at this urgent time.\"",
      "Lauren acknowledges this scheme is more targeted at opening that initial door for artists of the future than sustaining a career in the industry.",
      "\"To basically provide opportunities for them to learn and grow and connect and be nurtured so they can actually even imagine becoming an artist and making a livelihood off it,\" she says.",
      "Spotify isn't the only private company that's announced schemes aimed at filling the gap in youth services this year.",
      "Working with BBC Children in Need and fronted by rapper AJ Tracey, McDonald's launched its Makin' It project, partnering restaurants with youth workers so they can host workshops and drop-in sessions.",
      "And in south London, Stormzy set up a youth club in partnership with Adidas earlier this year, something Lauren says inspired Spotify.",
      "\"It's great these bigger companies are coming in and investing in those communities as part of their corporate social responsibility,\" says Shadey.",
      "\"But the depth is only gonna be seen if they partner with community leaders and grassroots organisations so it's authentic.\"",
      "Stormzy's Merky FC is a state-of-the-art facility with a full-size football pitch, recording studio and gaming centre and the rapper told the BBC he'd be a regular visitor, providing songwriting masterclasses and gaming.",
      "Spotify on the other hand will be taking a more hands-off approach and won't be involved in the Youth Music scheme beyond the funding they've pledged.",
      "But Shadey thinks the power of brand alone will draw people in.",
      "His Mirror Mirror project supported 60 young people - all of whom had to apply - and provided trips to 1Xtra and Abbey Road studios and the Houses of Parliament to give them a taste of the music industry.",
      "\"I think youth clubs today need to create that same model where people know it's a privilege, they know it's an opportunity.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 17:42:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Lancaster also says she \"didn't realise\" her husband Sir Rod Stewart had posted online about Wallace.",
    "story": [
      "Model Penny Lancaster has claimed that she was both a \"witness\" and \"victim\" to \"bullying\" behaviour by former MasterChef host, Gregg Wallace.",
      "It is the first time the 53-year-old has spoken out since her husband, Sir Rod Stewart, publicly accused Wallace last month of being an \"ill-mannered bully\" who had \"humiliated\" his wife during her 2021 appearance on the show.",
      "Lancaster told ITV's Loose Women on Thursday: \"I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until it was out\".",
      "Wallace stepped down from MasterChef two weeks ago while an investigation into the allegations of historic misconduct are under way. His lawyers have strongly denied all the allegations.",
      "After the first claims emerged, Sir Rod posted on Instagram: \"Good riddance Wallace... You humiliated my wife when she was on the show, but you had that bit cut out didn't you?",
      "\"You're a tubby, bald-headed, ill-mannered bully. Karma got ya. Sir Rod Stewart\".",
      "Lancaster - who made it to the quarter-finals of Celebrity MasterChef - told Loose Women: \"Without going into details, I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until it was out and of course, you can imagine, the influx of inquiries there were.\"",
      "She said she was on jury duty at the time and didn't realise what had happened until later, saying she was \"in shock\" by Sir Rod's message.",
      "\"When I did turn my phone back on I got a message from a friend saying, 'Oh my God, how amazing was that message your husband put out!' And I was like 'What message? What has he done?'\"",
      "Speaking to the panel, Lancaster said: \"I most definitely was witness and victim to some of the bullying and harassment behaviour of Gregg Wallace, and unfortunately, a lot of those involved in the production team were also witness to that, and I really feel that he used his position of power to, I believe, intimidate and cause distress to a lot of people on set.",
      "\"And it's really unfortunate that someone like him is allowed to get away with that, and while others sort of stand by and let it happen at the same time.\"",
      "Lancaster added: \"I felt a little bit vindicated that something was put out there, going back to sort of that whole Me Too [movement], it's shocking to think how many women do suffer in the hands of... [men] in a powerful position and are too afraid to talk out.",
      "\"They don't feel at the time that they're going to be supported or listened to. So sometimes it can take a few years later for someone to mention something. It gives the other victims and people that have suffered the confidence to come forward.\"",
      "Wallace stepped aside from presenting MasterChef after a BBC News investigation last month discovered 13 people, spanning a range of ages across five different programmes, had made allegations against Wallace of inappropriate sexual comments.",
      "Other women have since come forward with further claims against the 60-year-old.",
      "Wallace's lawyers have said it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Production company Banijay UK announced an \"immediate, external review to fully and impartially investigate\" and has said that Wallace was \"committed to fully cooperating throughout the process\".",
      "Asked about Lancaster's specific allegations, Banijay says it \"takes this matter incredibly seriously but while the external investigation is ongoing, we won't be commenting on individual allegations\".",
      "\"It is important to note, that MasterChef welfare processes are regularly adapted and strengthened and there are clear protocols to support both crew and contributors.",
      "\"These include multiple ways of reporting issues, including anonymously. HR contact details are promoted, and contributors are assigned a point of contact on set available to discuss any issues or concerns.\"",
      "A BBC spokesman has described the allegations into Wallace's conduct as \"concerning\", and said the corporation would be supporting MasterChef producer Banijay UK in its investigation.",
      "It also thanked those \"who had the courage to speak out\", adding it hopes that the independent investigation \"can be concluded rigorously and as swiftly as possible\" and would \"follow due process and ensure fairness to all involved.\"",
      "Lancaster met her rock-star husband, best known for hit songs 'Do You Think I'm Sexy' and 'Maggie May', in 1999 while he was on tour. The couple married in 2007 and have two sons, Alastair, 18 and Aiden, 13.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles got into the festive spirit with an enthusiastically received visit to a Christmas market in Battersea Power Station in south-west London.",
      "A community choir was singing the carol We Three Kings as he arrived - and they had at least one real-life King there in person to listen.",
      "\"You must be frozen. You'll need a stiff drink,\" the King said to the singers, outside in the December drizzle.",
      "The King also met Apple chief Tim Cook at the computer firm's UK headquarters in the huge former power station building, before singer Raye gave them a seasonal serenade of \"Holy Night\".",
      "Much of the power station is now a glitzy mall and Christmas shoppers got more than they bargained for as the King appeared, walking past the window of Starbucks.",
      "There can be something wistful about even the most cheerful carols - and it's been a difficult year for the King, with his health problems.",
      "But he looked cheerful here, talking to some rather gobsmacked stallholders under the Christmas lights. He always seems energised by the crowds, joking and chatting.",
      "When he was being steered on to the next part of the trip, he still dived across for an impromptu meeting with shoppers, shaking hands and facing the wall of mobile phones.",
      "The trip to the power station seemed to recharge him.",
      "He was introduced to 90-year-old Rita Kelly, who had worked here in the 1950s when the turbines were pumping out power for the capital, and who said she was \"honoured\" to talk about her memories with the King.",
      "\"Working here was a very happy time,\" she said. Although she said the King seemed to know about her \"mischievous\" side, when as a youngster she'd misguidedly tried to go upside one of the huge chimneys.",
      "Not even Father Christmas would have risked that one.",
      "The King visited the Curated Makers Market and saw the stalls for small traders and craftspeople. It was founded by Megan Jones, who has been supported by the King's Trust, formerly known as the Prince's Trust.",
      "\"People tend to go to big shops, but here they can talk to people behind the brand,\" said Soophia Foroughi, who chatted to the King about her handmade jewellery, under her label Ava and Azar.",
      "Natasha Kutrovatz, who sells her own jewellery, was delighted by the King's interest in people making a living from handmade crafts. \"As a parent, it's a much more flexible way of working,\" she said.",
      "The 1930s power station once produced a fifth of London's electricity, including supplying landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.",
      "The link to Buckingham Palace had been discreetly labelled as \"Carnaby Street\" in the control room, in case anyone broke in and literally wanted to switch off the Palace lights, said a spokeswoman for the power station.",
      "With the crowds and cameras for the King's visit, it was probably louder inside the halls than when it was generating power.",
      "It's enough to shake Santa's workshop, although in a designer outlet like this, the resident Santa is living in a \"yurt\".",
      "This huge cathedral of the industrial age remains an impressive sight - and the King's mother, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, had come here in 1949 to see the power station operating.",
      "The power station, built with six million bricks, is now filled with shops and places to eat and drink and the King looked up inside this cavernous post-industrial landmark. He waved back to some rather taken-aback shoppers, looking down from the layers of walkways above.",
      "The boiler house is so big that St Paul's Cathedral could fit inside.",
      "The King is known to be interested in architecture and design - and this building, with its four chimneys looking like an upside down coffee table, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, also responsible for the classic red phone box and Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.",
      "There's a strong sense of design for another business based in the power station - the technology firm, Apple, which the King visited after the Christmas market.",
      "Some might see parallels between Apple computers and the monarchy - a bit expensive but with many dedicated fans who think it's worth it.",
      "The King went into the Apple headquarters to meet chief executive Mr Cook and was shown an example of the firm's artificial technology, which can turn a few squiggles into a fully-fledged illustration.",
      "The computer company has worked with the King's Trust to help provide young people with digital skills and the King unveiled a plaque.",
      "Cook praised the King's \"lifelong commitment to philanthropy and the betterment of humanity\".",
      "There's a message about changed times in how it's Apple that now occupies these old buildings. This power station once used a million tonnes of coal a year, dug up in coalfields in Wales and northern England. It is tech-firms like Apple and designer shops that now fill the huge halls.",
      "And given how much the King has been photographed by mobile phones, there can few people in the country who have seen as many iPhones close up.",
      "At the end of the visit, drawings by children at a nearby primary school were projected on to the giant chimneys, climbing up into the evening sky. As the King left there was more music, with a performance by singer-songwriter Raye.",
      "After all the Christmas trees and conversations, maybe it was time for his own stiff drink."

      "They say they had \"no other option\" but to take court action against the House Anxiety label, which signed the group in 2020 and released their Full Wack No Breaks mixtape that year.",
      "In response, House Anxiety said they \"totally refute these claims\" and welcomed the chance to \"clarify these inaccuracies\".",
      "Bad Boy Chiller Crew's claim says they were supposed to have been given royalty statements by the label every six months, but only received their first one in October 2024.",
      "That royalty statement had \"vast sums\" wrongly deducted, and did not include \u00a3217,000 that House Anxiety had received in a licensing deal with a subsidiary of major label Sony, the band argue.",
      "The claim says the group can't accurately calculate how much they are owed until they receive a full set of accounts. But they believe it will amount to at least \u00a3400,000.",
      "The group also argue their contract with House Anxiety has ended.",
      "They independently released a new single and an EP in June, but removed both from Spotify after House Anxiety complained it was a breach of their contract.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Bad Boy Chiller Crew said: \"Like all other bands, we don't look for litigation, but when faced with a label that won't let us put our own music out ourselves for our fans and not pay us royalties owed from our own music, we felt we had no other option.\"",
      "House Anxiety founder Jaimie Hodgson said: \"We totally refute these claims and welcome the opportunity to clarify these inaccuracies.",
      "\"As an artist-friendly independent label, we remain hugely proud of every element of Full Wack No Breaks and all the hard work that went into its campaign, then stepping aside to allow BBCC to pursue their dreams of being a major label artist. There will be no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Full Wack No Breaks included the band's breakthrough track 450.",
      "The follow-up, Disrespectful, reached number two in the UK album chart in 2022 under the licensing deal with Sony's Relentless label.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 06:13:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year.",
      "A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child.",
      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",

      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",

      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",

    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 04:03:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The psychological condition stops players from releasing a dart.",
    "story": [
      "Former professional darts champion Kevin Painter has thrown arrows almost every day for 40 years.",
      "Throughout his career he thrived under pressure, playing in the most prestigious competitions and taking home more than \u00a3900,000 in prize money.",
      "But earlier this year, he went to throw a dart and it physically would not leave his hand.",
      "\"You're in shock, I stood there for ages. I just couldn't get my arm up to let go of the dart,\" he said.",
      "Kevin was suffering from dartitis, a mental condition where the brain stops a player from being able to release a dart.",
      "Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge.",
      "\"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University.",
      "From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis.",
      "\"I used to combat it with extra practice. It was heard of back in the day, but not many people spoke about it,\" she said.",
      "Dartitis can affect all players, professional or amateur.",
      "Jack Langston, a darts referee and online content creator, was 12 when he first experienced the condition.",
      "\"There was a little pause just before I threw the dart,\" he said.",
      "It was barely noticeable at first but eventually it became so bad he would take 60 seconds to throw three darts.",
      "By the age of 13, he was forced to quit and at the time, considered his darts career to be over.",
      "\"You're turning up and getting beat by people you know you should be beating,\" he said.",
      "\"It's so demoralising. It's a real mental struggle.\"",
      "Every case is different, and there is no one single cause, but lots of players report it comes from a fear of missing.",
      "\"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said.",
      "\"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\"",
      "After he first experienced the condition, Kevin was introduced to a hypnotherapist.",
      "Chris O'Connor runs Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy, the official hypnotherapy partner of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",
      "During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are then \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said.",
      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured.",
      "He thanked Mr O'Connor and said the treatment had worked, in a video posted to social media.",
      "But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned.",
      "\"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "Dr Duffy admitted she is unconvinced by hypnotherapy.",
      "\"I don't think it'll work - ever - because throwing darts is a conscious skill. So having therapy on your unconscious movements, I don't think is going to help it,\" she said.",
      "Perhaps due to its name, players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions.",
      "But Dr Duffy emphasises \"it's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way\".",
      "She prefers to use cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), where the player reframes dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",
      "But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments.",
      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "To help aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "While reducing alcohol consumption is a welcome benefit, Dr Duffy is clear she does not think there is a link between drinking and dartitis.",
      "\"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder,\" she said.",
      "Kevin plans to continue his hypnotherapy treatment, hoping this time the dartitis stays away for good.",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 01:57:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Ministers plan to combine smaller councils across England, prompting warnings of \"turmoil\" over mergers.",
    "story": [
      "District councils could be abolished and more elected mayors introduced across England under new plans for a major redesign of local government.",
      "Ministers are set to publish a paper on Monday outlining plans for mergers in areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services.",
      "Elected metro mayors are also set to gain new powers over planning, in a bid to speed up the delivery of new housing and infrastructure.",
      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "Labour will level up better than Tories - Starmer",
      "New county-wide council comes into force",
      "Local government in England is currently marked by a complicated patchwork of arrangements that has changed a lot in recent years.",
      "In some places, responsibility for local services is shared between county councils, which manage areas including social care and education, and district councils, which cover smaller areas and are responsible for services such as bin collections.",
      "Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing.",
      "The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030.",
      "Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal.",
      "The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing.",
      "'Default position'",
      "A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals.",
      "Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment.",
      "Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two\u00a0or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport.",
      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and mark arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "The overall timetable and route to achieving this has not been confirmed - and it is not yet clear if the government will use legal powers to force councils together, or hope to encourage them to do so through funding arrangements.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "In a speech on Monday, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner will vow to make devolution the \"default position of government\", and give councils the powers they need to \"drive growth and raise living standards\".",
      "But previous attempts at reorganising local government have led to rows about geographical boundaries and where power sits.",
      "'Period of turmoil'",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network (DCN), an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that  taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",
      "She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\".",
      "A Conservative party spokesman said Rayner's announcement is part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\".",
      "He said the party recognises more homes need to be built but says that these must be \"in the right place\".",
      "\"This new announcement will do nothing to solve that - and instead open up another front on Labour's assault on the\u00a0countryside.\"",
      "The plans, however, have been welcomed by the County Councils Network (CCN), which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\".",
      "Its chairman Tim Oliver said it had become clear that in many county areas, reorganisation was needed to \"unlock\" more generous funding from central government and create \"more financially sustainable\" councils.",
      "Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".",
      "She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\".",
      "Planning powers",
      "Monday's paper is also expected to confirm plans for increased co-operation between councils in planning for transport and infrastructure projects.",
      "Upper-tier councils, including unitary authorities and current county councils, will be required to produce slimmed-down versions of the \"spatial development\" strategies used to plan for projects in big cities.",
      "Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals:  Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire.",
      "Combined authorities, including combined county authorities in more rural areas, are more advanced in the north of England compared to the south.",
      "There has been a weaker appetite for devolution deals in swathes of the south-west and East Anglia, where minimum population requirements would also necessitate the creation of larger combined councils.",
      "Speaking on Sunday, Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham welcomed the plans for his area but said they did not go \"far enough\" when it came to giving elected mayors more control over skills policy.",
      "He added this was an area driven by local needs, and the \"centralising view\" of the education department risked \"putting a brake\" on economic growth."

    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said the British government has had \"diplomatic contact\" with the Syrian rebel group that toppled the Assad regime.",
      "Lammy said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, but the UK \"can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact, as you would expect\".",
      "His US counterpart Antony Blinken said on Saturday that the US had made \"direct contact\" with the HTS rebels now in control of Syria.",

      "\"For all of those reasons, using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and of course intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.\"",
      "The diplomatic contact with HTS does not mean the foreign secretary has personally been in touch with the rebel group.",
      "Whitehall sources say the contact referred to is permitted under the terms of existing terrorism legislation, under which, for example, NGOs would be able to have contact in order to provide humanitarian assistance.",
      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",

    "summary": "The home secretary said the number of crossings - more than 20,000 since Labour took power - was \"far too high\".",
    "story": [
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has told the BBC the level of \"dangerous\" small boat Channel crossings is \"far too high\" but she refused to set out a timetable to reduce the number.",
      "More than 20,000 people have made the crossing to the UK since Labour took power, up on 17,020 during the same period last year.",
      "During a visit to Rome, Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show there had been a \"bad history\" of home secretaries giving pledges on migration they then failed to keep.",
      "But the Conservatives said Labour's decision to scrap the Tories' Rwanda deportation scheme would prove a \"huge mistake\".",
      "Also speaking to Kuenssberg, shadow home secretary Chris Philp said his party would seek to put in place a \"deterrent-style scheme\" if it returned to power.",
      "The number of migrants crossing the Channel in Labour's first five months in office is down on the same period in 2022, a record year for arrivals, but similar to the number who crossed in that period in 2021.",
      "Cooper said the number of crossings was still \"deeply damaging\" and \"dangerous\", and was undermining border security as well as putting lives at risk.",
      "\"Of course we want to continue to progress, of course we want to see the boat crossings come down as rapidly as possible.",
      "\"What we are not going to do is deal with this by slogans. Rishi Sunak said he'd stop the boats in a year.\"",
      "Asked whether the government's reluctance to set public targets on reducing the number of small boat crossings shows it was not a priority, Cooper said: \"Quite the opposite.",
      "\"We've made clear that border security is actually one of the foundational issues\".",
      "Labour has put action against people-smuggling gangs, as well as broader law enforcement efforts, at the heart of its strategy to reduce boat crossings.",
      "On Sunday, the Home Office published new figures showing a total of 13,460 foreign nationals had been returned to their home countries through both forced and voluntary departures since Labour came to office in July.",
      "The department said the number of enforced returns was up compared to the same period last year, arguing greater collaboration with other countries had made more return flights possible.",
      "Philp argued the uptick in returns was the continuation of a \"trend\" which had started before this year's election.",
      "Labour has also previously expressed an interest in studying Italy's deal with Albania, under which some migrants rescued by the Italian coastguard will be sent there to have their asylum claims processed.",
      "That five-year agreement has faced significant challenges, with transfers recently halted by a court in Rome.",
      "Asked whether Labour would also consider processing asylum claims offshore, Cooper said the government would \"look at whatever works\" but emphasised that any such scheme would need to be \"effective\".",
      "She also blamed an increase in hotel places for asylum seekers since the election on a \"collapse in decision-making\" ahead of the vote, which she argued had left Labour with a \"soaring backlog\" of cases on entering office.",
      "Speaking on Sky News, Home Office minister Angela Eagle defended the lack of an official timetable for reducing crossings, adding that the public wanted to see \"steady progress\" rather than a \"date snatched out of the air\".",

      "The Conservatives under Kemi Badenoch have also separately committed to setting a cap on annual legal migration into the UK.",
      "Asked where the cap would be set, Philp did not offer details beyond saying it would be \"far, far lower\" than the 350,000 predicted for future years by official economic forecasters.",

      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",

      "The UK has joined a trade pact with several countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan and Australia.",
      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",
      "But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.",

      "Court delays experienced by victims and defendants are unacceptable, the man leading the government's review into the backlog of criminal cases has said.",
      "Sir Brian Leveson, a retired High Court judge, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"radical\" steps would need to be taken to tackle the \"crisis\" which has seen cases added to the criminal justice system \"faster than they can be removed.\"",
      "Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show 73,105 trials were unheard at the end of September, almost double the number in 2019.",
      "Sir Brian's report, due next year, will consider the creation of intermediate courts, where cases could be heard by a judge flanked by magistrates, to reduce the backlog.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the announcement of the review, Sir Brian said the number of prosecutions waiting to be dealt with was \"unsustainable\" - with listings now running into 2027.",
      "\"This isn't so much a challenge,\" he told the BBC, \"it's a crisis in the criminal justice system which has to be addressed\".",
      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",
      "\"The extent to which we can divert people from the criminal justice system is a live one and that's one of the areas I will be looking at,\" he said, adding intermediate courts currently do not exist, \"so you're either in the magistrates' court or you're in a Crown Court.\"",
      "One suggestion is that the jury could be replaced in many middle-ranking cases by a single district judge and two community magistrates.",
      "Sir Brian would consider whether magistrates should have a broader remit to deal with more cases, potentially including increasing their sentencing powers.",
      "On Thursday, Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood described the backlog as \"unprecedented\".",
      "\"We owe it to victims to find bold, innovative approaches that will speed up justice,\" she said, adding criminals should know \"they will quickly face the consequence of their actions.\"",
      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",
      "Fuelled by a surge of online misinformation, the riots saw buildings including mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers vandalised and dozens of police officers injured.",
      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",
      "\"People were being sentenced, convicted, tried, all within a speedy time,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that's the way we deter crime best - by early detection, early prosecution and early resolution.\"",
      "Sir Brian's report will land on ministers' desks around the same time as a parallel review of sentencing of offenders.",

    "summary": "Keir Starmer has vowed to beat building \"blockers\" but can he override stiff local resistance?",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system that could see councils forced to consider building on green belt land in England.",
      "The prime minister has vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes needed to solve the housing crisis.",
      "But some locals in the areas where these houses will need to be built are steadfast in their opposition to more housing.",
      "One rural corner of Kent is rapidly becoming a test case for how determined the government is to force through planning decisions in the teeth of local objections.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner stepped in at the last minute and took the decision about whether to go ahead with an 8,400 home development out of the local council's hands.",
      "While it's not unusual for ministers to intervene in planning applications, the scale of this potential development means it's being viewed by many as an early test of the government's approach.",
      "You can't avoid building new housing, minister tells councils",
      "Plans for huge garden village facing rejection",
      "Backlash from councils over Rayner housing targets",
      "If you have the stomach for it, you can climb the narrow crumbling stone spiral staircase to reach the roof of St Nicholas' Church in Rodmersham.",
      "From the top of the Norman church you get a panoramic view of north Kent. Directly below there is an apple orchard, beyond that fields of arable farmland with the occasional house, and in the distance the town of Sittingbourne, silhouettes of Thames Estuary heavy industry visible against the sky.",
      "This is the land where Quinn Estates developers want to build 8,400 homes, new schools and a new road.",
      "\"It's an absolutely colossal development, it will have a devastating impact on this area,\" says Monique Bonney.",
      "She grew up in Rodmersham and after living and working across the world returned to the village. She got married in St Nicholas' Church and has been an independent councillor for the area for 18 years.",
      "She is not just concerned about the size of the new development - Rodmersham is currently made up of 275 homes - but how much will be affordable.",
      "Only 760 homes, she says - about 9% of the proposed development. The developers say the level of affordable housing will be decided at a future inquiry.",
      "But others say the proposals are desperately needed, both for the local area and nationally. The UK has one of the worst housing shortages in the rich world.",
      "Sittingbourne Football Club chairman Maurice Dunk thinks the development is exactly what the area needs.",
      "His club is flying high at the moment - second in the South East Division of the Isthmian league and on an FA trophy run.",
      "It is sponsored by Quinn Estates and would get a new stadium if the plans go ahead.",
      "\"The town is in a bit of a state. We need the roads. Between Sittingbourne and Sheppey there's over 100,000 people trying to use one motorway junction.",
      "\"I appreciate the local people don't want the houses, nobody does, but the business community definitely wants this to retain jobs in the area and hopefully expand jobs in the area.\"",
      "Monique Bonney says the area has the worst GP-to-patient ratio in the country. New medical facilities are included in the development proposal, but she is sceptical this will happen.",
      "\"I think my experience of 18 years of being an independent parish councillor and a district councillor has demonstrated that the system has utterly failed and government is absolutely incompetent for trying to deliver infrastructure services to local people.\"",
      "Chris Mitchell, landlord of the local Fruiterers Arms pub, is similarly opposed: \"It will no longer be a village, it will just be another part of a commute to London.\"",
      "Bonney is not the only councillor opposing the proposals - the local Labour-led council was on the verge of voting to reject them.",
      "But at the eleventh hour it was \"called in\" by Housing Secretary Angela Rayner. This means the government will take over the planning application rather than let the local authority decide.",
      "\"It seemed very undemocratic,\" said local Green Party councillor Rich Lehmann.",
      "\"They [councillors] should have been able to make their decision, even if it went to appeal after that decision was made.\"",
      "Labour MP Kevin McKenna was one of around 70 others who asked Rayner to intervene in the decision.",
      "He said: \"I definitely wanted it called in. This [decision] has been running round the houses. I wanted it properly assessed.\"",
      "\"Both the major parties pledged to cut through these blockages to building, and Labour made it really clear we were going to look at planning from the get-go.\"",
      "This is the kind of battle the Labour government faces if it wants to meet the target it has set itself.",
      "After a two-month consultation, ministers have published the final version of changes to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The government says it will:",
      "Give councils mandatory targets to deliver 370,000 homes a year in EnglandPrioritise brownfield sites \u2013 disused areas that have been developed in the past \u2013 for new buildingsProvide \u00a3100m for councils and 300 additional planning officers to speed up the planning processOrder councils to identify lower quality green belt land \u2013 or \"grey belt\"  land which could be built on.",

      "Order councils to identify lower quality green belt land \u2013 or \"grey belt\"  land which could be built on.",
      "The housing secretary said the government would \"deliver the housing and infrastructure in a more co-ordinated way\".",
      "\"In the past we haven't seen that. We've seen years of dither and delay, legal challenges.\"",
      "Adam Hug from the Local Government Association said: \"People cannot and do not live in planning permissions\".",
      "He said local authorities should be given greater powers to force developers to build once they had secured planning permissions, rather than sitting on the land.",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Labour will bulldoze through the concerns of local communities.\"",
      "During the consultation phase, local councils told the government its housebuilding plan was \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Sittingbourne FC chairman Dunk is confident that the proposal will deliver \"desperately needed\" schools and GPs.",
      "He is happy the development proposal got called in: \"I really don't want to be disrespectful to our local council, but it might be too big for them to decide on.\"",

      "Protesters drove tractors through Westminster on Wednesday, staging another protest against October's Budget, while in the Commons Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on the PM to \"change course and recognise the vital role that British family farms play\".",
      "But Sir Keir Starmer insisted the \"vast majority\" of farmers would not be affected by the tax changes.",
      "As a result of the Budget, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to inheritance tax (IHT) at 20% - half the normal rate.",
      "Other allowances could allow a couple to pass on a farm worth up to \u00a33m.",

      "Mr Bradshaw called for tax changes to focus on personal wealth, not business wealth, which he said would lead to a \"very different proposal than the one that's on the table\".",
      "\"Our position is: let's work with you to get to an outcome that works for all rather than the blunt instrument that we have today,\" he told MPs.",
      "He was moved to tears when he spoke about farmers taking their lives.",

      "Robert Martin, national chairman at the Tenant Farmers Association, said the plan to close the tax loophole - involving wealthy people avoiding inheritance tax by buying up farmland - would not work because capital gains tax rollover relief for agricultural businesses had been left in place.",
      "Tax expert Dr Arun Advani, director of think tank CenTax, told the committee the Budget measures would probably only \"slightly\" slow land price inflation, because the 20% IHT rate was \"still much more attractive than other sorts of assets\".",

      "\"It simply means this is going to be unaffordable and so farms are going to have to sell land or sell up. And it's going to happen a lot.\"",
      "He added it would be the \"unfortunate\" who were most caught out by the changes, such as farmers who died early or were too old to have enough time to plan.",
      "During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Ed called for a rethink of the policy, saying family farms had been badly let down by the previous Conservative government and now felt the recent Budget would be \"the final blow\".",
      "Sir Keir replied that the government had put \"a record\" \u00a35bn into farming over the  next two years.",
      "On IHT, he added, \"in a typical family case the threshold is \u00a33m and therefore the vast majority of farmers will be unaffected despite the fearmongering of the party opposite [the Conservatives]\".",
      "The prime minister's spokesman later said there would not be a rethink on inheritance tax, adding \"we understand the strength of feeling about the changes, but we are clear this will only affect a small number of estates\".",

      "\"We're very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly,\" she added.",

    "summary": "At least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten in a Bronze Age massacre in Somerset.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have uncovered the aftermath of an \"exceptionally violent\" attack about 4,000 years ago in Somerset when at least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten.",
      "It is the largest case of violence between humans identified in early Bronze Age England, which had been considered a peaceful time.",
      "The victims' bones were found by cavers in the 1970s. Experts believe they were thrown into a 15m shaft by the prehistoric attackers.",
      "The massacre was probably driven by a furious \"desire for revenge\" and its effects likely \"echoed through generations\", says Professor Rick Schulting at Oxford university.",
      "He says the victims may have been eaten as a ritual to \"dehumanise\" them and to send a message by \"insulting the remains\".",
      "Around 3,000 fragments of bones found at a cave system called Charterhouse Warren in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, were analysed by a team of archaeologists.",
      "They believe that at least 37 people died, including men, woman and children. Teenagers and older children made up about half of the victims.",
      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",
      "The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity."

    "summary": "A new DNA analysis has shown that the arrival of modern humans from Africa was far from smooth.",
    "story": [
      "Far from triumphantly breezing out of Africa, modern humans went extinct many times before going on to populate the world, new studies have revealed.",
      "The new DNA research has also shed new light on the role our Neanderthal cousins played in our success.",
      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

      "Friendly fungi help forests fight climate change",
      "The insulin pump is a small device - around the size of a deck of cards - which supplies a continuous flow of longer-acting insulin through a cannula underneath the skin. This device comes in two forms, tubed and tubeless. Tubed pumps last for multiple years, with the insulin supply getting replaced every two to three days.",
      "Tubeless pumps are worn once and a new pump is applied every two to three days. They are changed often to stop the insulin supply running out and to prevent infection.",
      "An advantage of the insulin pump is that it allows increased flexibility for people with unpredictable schedules or who require smaller doses of insulin. This means that people with changing work shifts, who don\u2019t necessarily eat and exercise at set times each day can still have set doses of insulin.",
      "A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2011 says that 86% of survey respondents cited that the insulin pump fits in with their lifestyle much better than injections.",
      "It is also more convenient to change an insulin supply or pump every two or three days, than it is to inject, on average, four times a day.",
      "However, there are disadvantages with pumps, as they are not for everyone. It may be difficult for people with eyesight or mobility problems to change their pump, but this issue is also related to insulin injections. Cannulas can also bend, restricting the flow of insulin, and the pump can sometimes become disconnected from the tubing without the user noticing.",
      "The NHS only offers insulin pumps to those who experience frequent episodes of dangerously low or high blood sugar without warning. These are known as \u201chypos\u201d or \u201chypers\u201d. This means that many people choose to self-fund an insulin pump, which typically costs \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000. On top of that, the cost of the equipment needed costs just over \u00a31,000 per year. That is not affordable for many diabetics.",
      "Dr Iain MacLeod., who works as a GP at Prestonpans Group Practice in Scotland told me that insulin pumps had been \u201clife-changing for many patients\u201d.",
      "\u201cI think [they] have been an excellent addition to the range of options available for managing diabetes,\u201d he said.",
      "Dr MacLeod also expressed that pumps  \u201callow more flexibility\u201d, but that they \u201dare a lot more expensive than standard insulin therapy so, in these times of huge financial pressures within the NHS, it is probably not realistic for all diabetic patients to get the more expensive treatment options.",
      "\u201cIf the pump is the best option for a patient, then I would gladly recommend it,\u201d he added.",
      "Insulin pumps are becoming more accessible - and even more fashionable -  with companies selling accessories and pouches to protect pumps. I think this is making it easier to live with and accept the reality of the device, which is often life-changing.",

      "It says safety will now be \"infused\" in all it does through new features which will tell parents how their child is using the platform - including how much time they're spending talking to chatbots and the ones they speak to the most.",
      "The platform - which allows users to create digital personalities they can interact with - will get its \"first iteration\" of parental controls by the end of March 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:08:26 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

      "In his first media interview since his 2019 ordeal, the man - whom we are calling James to protect his identity - said his first day at the camp was terrifying as a huge number of Islamist fighters returned from an operation, firing shots in the air.",
      "\"I thought that was the end. I was just sweating,\" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns - and laughed.",
      "James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.",
      "\"The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles]. So he asked me which of them I could operate, and I said I had never operated one before. He said: 'We have bigger weapons, so if I give you a battalion to handle, no-one can harm you',\" James added.",
      "He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana - a promise he says he never kept.",
      "Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.",

      "In Burkina Faso, they are strongest in the north, where they control large areas, but they have also expanded to the south, along the porous 550km-long (340 mile) border with Ghana.",
      "More than 15,000 people from Burkina Faso have fled into northern Ghana to escape the conflict, aid agencies say.",
      "Apart from Burkina Faso, the jihadists have also gained territory in Niger and Mali, and have carried out attacks in Ivory Coast,  Benin and Togo - all former French colonies - raising fears that the insurgency was spreading south towards the coast.",

      "In a report released in July, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank said the \"absence of real attacks on Ghanaian soil seems to result from JNIM's calculus of not disturbing supply lines and places of rest as well as not provoking a relatively strong army\".",
      "\"Examples of people who are spared by JNIM by showing their Ghanaian identity cards fits this reading,\" it added.",
      "Most Ghanaians are Christians, but the population near the border with Burkina Faso is mainly Muslim - and parts of the region have also been riven with ethnic tensions, raising fears that the jihadists could exploit them to their advantage.",
      "The think-tank said that JNIM had attempted in a \"very small number\" of instances to recruit or incite Ghana's small, largely Muslim Fulani community to carry out attacks.",
      "JNIM claimed that they were marginalised, but its recruitment efforts had \"minimal success\" as the Fulani were \"aware of the chaos that has enveloped the Sahel due to familial networks\" and did not want it to occur in Ghana, the think-tank added.",
      "A Fulani Muslim preacher in Burkina Faso, Amadou Koufa, is the co-founder of JNIM and is its second-in-command. He recruits most of his fighters from the Fulani community in Burkina Faso.",

      "A handful of jihadists, also on motorbikes, stopped him and took him to their camp where he was interrogated until their commander was convinced that he was not a spy, James said.",
      "He added that his blindfold - the trademark black jihadist flag - was then removed.",
      "James said he found about 500 insurgents - mostly young men, including one who identified himself as a doctor - living in the camp.",
      "Located in desert-like terrain, it was made up of thatch-roofed huts, with small electricity-generating solar panels, he said.",
      "He added that the camp was divided into three sections - for commanders and their families, lower-ranking jihadists and captured villagers and soldiers.",
      "James said he was detained in the latter section, but got \"closer\" to the jihadists in the second week as he increasingly acted as though he had become a sympathiser of their cause.",
      "They sat around in groups of five or 10, and listened to the songs of Salif Ke\u00efta, the Malian musician known as the Golden Voice of Africa, James said.",
      "Other jihadist groups have banned music, saying it is un-Islamic.",
      "James said that while the atmosphere at the camp was generally relaxed, groups of jihadists regularly went to fight, firing celebratory shots when they returned, claiming to have achieved battlefield success.",
      "James said he realised that this was the gunfire he had heard on the first day, and got used to it.",
      "He added that the insurgents parked their tanks and pick-up trucks in two inter-connected tunnels to ensure they were not destroyed if there was an air strike, while only a few vehicles remained outside \"on stand-by, for an emergency\".",
      "He said the jihadists also revealed their darkest sides - telling him they captured women during raids on villages and sold them to each other.",
      "\"They trade the women they\u2019ve captured. Others sell wives that they are fed up with. Those who resist are gang-raped into submission by two or three fighters,\" James added, though he did not see them do this.",
      "James said the women at the camp included the wives of jihadists who performed domestic chores like cooking and cleaning, while those who were captured were either sex-slaves or were forced to become fighters.",
      "He explained that he saw fully veiled women, with AK-47 rifles hidden under their clothes, leave the camp to raid villages for livestock to feed people at the camp - or to sell at markets in nearby towns.",
      "James said he also saw dozens of children, including those of jihadists, being trained in the use of weapons and explosives.",
      "\"You'll see a small kid holding a gun and telling you that if he goes to meet some people, this is how he is going to kill them,\" James added.",
      "He said he twice saw four children being taken to another location, before returning to the camp with suicide vests.",
      "They wore long, loose outfits over them, and left the camp with begging bowls, James said.",
      "Jihadists told him that when they anticipate a tough battle in a town or military camp, they send children disguised as beggars who then blow themselves up, so the fighters can enter amid the chaos, James said.",
      "He added that three jihadists had told him that they \"sacrifice their children as suicide bombers and they get paid after every mission\", though they did not disclose the amount.",
      "He said the jihadists tried to indoctrinate him, preaching that \"anything Western is evil\" and showing him propaganda videos every night, including one of the US invasion of Iraq and the killing of Palestinians in the current conflict with Israel.",
      "According to James, as the insurgency was being waged in French-speaking countries, all the jihadists were Francophone, but one spoke English with a Ghanaian accent, and always kept his face covered so that he could not see him.",
      "In a sign that the jihadists were also influenced by pan-Africanism, James said some of them invoked the names of revolutionaries like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and told him that people should \"rise up\" against \"bad leaders\" and free themselves from \"bondage\".",
      "James said the jihadists also expressed the view that if Sankara and Nkrumah had \"lived long\",  then \"the whole of Africa would have been a better place - nobody would have travelled from Africa to the West. People would have been travelling from the West to Africa\".",
      "James, unemployed at the time, said their rhetoric was powerful, and only \"strength of heart\" prevented him from joining their ranks.",
      "On how exactly he was captured, James said that two Muslim friends were travelling with him at the time, promising to introduce him to a Muslim spiritual leader in Senegal who could pray for him and improve his fortunes.",
      "All three of them were intercepted by the jihadists as they were coming to the end of the first leg of their trip, he said.",
      "James added one of his friends was shot dead as he attempted to flee, while his other friend was taken with him to the camp.",
      "James said the commander did not release his friend, making him fear that he had been forced to join the jihadists - or was dead.",
      "\"The commander told me that: 'I will let you go if you assure me you will get me more fighters',\" James said.",
      "He added that before driving him to a bus rank and giving him the fare for the trip back home, the insurgents gave him a contact number to keep in touch, but, James said, he never did and changed his number.",
      "According to James, the jihadists also gave him charms, which supposedly had supernatural powers.",
      "Again, many other jihadists reject the use of amulets, believing them to be contrary to the teachings of Islam.",
      "James showed the BBC the amulets, which were made of fowl feathers, animal skins and herbs, covered in leather and cloth.",
      "They included one which the jihadists falsely told him offered protection from bullets.",
      "James said he never got the impression that the insurgents wanted to destabilise Ghana, seeing it as the \"safest place\" to hide when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military.",
      "Their focus was on waging an insurgency in countries where France and the US \"exists\", believing that these two countries exploit Africa's resources, to the detriment of its people, James said. This is denied by both countries.",
      "Ghana-based security analyst Adib Saani expressed concern about the growing insurgency in West Africa, and said he did not see a military solution to it.",
      "\u201cWe need to go beyond the militarised posture. We must address the socio-economic and geopolitical deficits that are creating the environment for terrorism to strive,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Ghana's National Commission for Civic Education has been carrying out a public awareness campaign dubbed \"see something, say something\" to encourage residents in the north to report suspicious activity.",
      "The campaign has also been extended to Accra, to educate young people about the dangers of jihadism.",
      "The commission's Mr Agbanu told the BBC that the campaign was vital as Ghanaians were vulnerable to recruitment.",
      "\"There\u2019s a high rate of corruption, unequal development across the country, and huge youth unemployment,\" he said.",
      "James, who is now a subsistence farmer, said that he was just relieved to be alive as the jihadist commander had told him that he was making an exception by releasing him because normally it was \"either your dead body that will go home or nobody will ever hear of you again\".",

      "Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.",
      "Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced.",
      "The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:14:31 GMT",
    "summary": "In the years before the mass rape trial that has shocked France, Gis\u00e8le almost caught Dominique Pelicot.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse",
      "It was November 2011, and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was sleeping too much.",
      "She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.",
      "Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed.",
      "Despite this, Gis\u00e8le, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lanc\u00f4me, their French bulldog, on long walks.",
      "She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gis\u00e8le would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s \u2013 but they had made it through.",
      "Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\"",
      "By that point, Gis\u00e8le and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box.",
      "He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as \u2013 in his own daughter's words \u2013 \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\".",
      "But in 2011, when Gis\u00e8le felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out.",
      "She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material \u2013 often extreme or illegal \u2013 was freely available.",
      "In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\"",
      "Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gis\u00e8le.",
      "At first he hesitated \u2013 but not for long.",
      "Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles.",
      "He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake.",
      "Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation.",
      "He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later.",
      "On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife.",
      "He would film them too.",
      "He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat.",
      "As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death.",
      "Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them.",
      "\"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gis\u00e8le was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\"",
      "Police station visit changed everything",
      "Sometimes, Gis\u00e8le came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\"",
      "Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts.",
      "Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gis\u00e8le was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission \u2013 drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied.",
      "Gis\u00e8le only felt better when she was away from Mazan \u2013 an oddity she barely noticed.",
      "It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.",
      "She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\".",
      "She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help.",
      "He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said.",
      "But Dominique must have known the end was near.",
      "Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others.",
      "\"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Bosse Plati\u00e8re, the director of the investigation, told the court.",
      "\"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague St\u00e9phane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\"",
      "His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology.",
      "They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless.",
      "Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Plati\u00e8re said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\"",
      "On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" \u2013  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes.",
      "\"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.",
      "At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.",
      "When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\".",
      "She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened.",
      "Recalling that moment, Gis\u00e8le said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her.",
      "'You cannot imagine the unimaginable'",
      "David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gis\u00e8le's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\".",
      "He and Gis\u00e8le wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024.",
      "By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gis\u00e8le's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "\"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\"",
      "Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" \u2013 pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gis\u00e8le as they didn't realise she was unconscious.",
      "\"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gis\u00e8le turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\"",
      "Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gis\u00e8le was clearly traumatised but calm and distant \u2013 a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks.",
      "Gis\u00e8le herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.",
      "Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gis\u00e8le \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\"",
      "Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised.",
      "Gis\u00e8le has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique.",
      "She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired.",
      "In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand.",
      "A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gis\u00e8le was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening?",
      "Pierre shook his head.",

      "In a post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said DST had \"a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't\" and that his Republican party would work to end it.",
      "DST is the practice of moving the clock ahead by one hour in the spring and back an hour in the autumn to make better use of natural daylight.",
      "It is observed in a third of the world's countries, according to Pew Research Center, including most of Europe. Some in the US, however, have long advocated to end the timeworn tradition.",
      "Those who want to stick with standard time say it benefits our health, as it is better to have more light in the morning, paving the way for improved sleep cycles on darker evenings. They say DST can be disorienting to sleep schedules.",
      "But others want to make DST permanent instead, arguing that brighter evenings, especially for those commuting from work or school, would reduce crime, conserve energy and even save lives in terms of reduced road accidents.",
      "Both sides say their preferred option would be better for the economy.",

      "Rubio has since been picked by Trump for the role of secretary of state under his incoming administration.",
      "The US first began changing its clocks seasonally in 1918 during World War One in an effort to conserve fuel. It was unpopular with farmers, and was repealed after the war.",
      "But DST returned again during World War Two, and was made permanent in 1966, though states could opt out.",
      "Hawaii and most of Arizona currently do not follow time changes under DST.",
      "Research by Joan Costa-i-Font, a professor at the London School of Economics, found that DST has had \"detrimental effects on sleep and physical health, and on feelings of fatigue, stress, time stress and mental health\".",
      "Prof Costa-i-Font's study found that, in monetary terms, an end to DST would lead to an increase in economic output of \u20ac754 ($792; \u00a3627) per person per year.",
      "Countries that have ended the practice include Mexico in 2022, though DST is still maintained in regions near the US border for economic and logistical reasons. Jordan also ended the practice that year.",
      "Others, like Turkey and Russia, have implemented a permanent DST instead in the past decade.",
      "In a Monmouth University Poll, researchers found that about two-thirds of people in the US want make DST permanent.",

    "story": [
      "When Bashar al-Assad was toppled on Sunday, it turned the page on not only his 24-year presidency but on more than 50 years of his family ruling Syria.",
      "Before Assad took office in 2000, his late father Hafez was president for three decades.",
      "Now, with rebels led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir-al Sham (HTS) forming a transitional government, the future of the deposed president, his wife and their three children is uncertain.",
      "They are now in Russia, where they have been offered asylum, but what lies ahead for them?",
      "Why did Assad flee to Russia?",
      "Russia was a staunch ally of Assad during Syria's civil war and has two key military bases in the Middle Eastern country.",
      "In 2015, Russia launched an air campaign in support of Assad that turned the tide of the war in the government's favour.",
      "A UK-based monitoring group reported that more than more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed in Russian military operations over the following nine years.",
      "However, distracted by its war in Ukraine, Russia was either unwilling or unable to help Assad's government stop the rebel's lightning offensive after it began in late November.",
      "Hours after rebel forces seized control of Damascus, it was reported by Russian state media that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow and that they would be granted asylum on \"humanitarian grounds\".",
      "But when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about Assad's whereabouts and asylum claim by reporters on Monday, he said: \"I have nothing to tell you... right now. Of course, such a decision [on granting asylum] cannot be made without the head of state. It is his decision.\"",
      "The Assads' ties to Russia, specifically Moscow, are well-documented.",
      "A 2019 investigation by the Financial Times found that Assad's extended family had purchased at least 18 luxury apartments in the Russian capital, in a bid to keep tens of millions of dollars out of Syria during the civil war.",
      "Meanwhile, Assad's eldest son, Hafez, is a PhD student in the city - with a local newspaper reporting just last week about the 22-year-old's doctoral dissertation.",
      "Amid the chaos at the weekend, Russian state TV reported that officials in Moscow were in talks with \"the Syrian armed opposition\" to secure Russia's bases and diplomatic missions.",

      "\"However, the USA [has] imposed sanctions on her father, Dr Fawaz al-Akhras, who is also reported to be in Russia,\" she said - suggesting Asma may want to stay put in Moscow for now.",
      "In a report by the Mail Online, neighbours were quoted as saying Asma's father, a cardiologist, and mother Sahar, a retired diplomat, wanted to be in Moscow to \"console\" their daughter and son-in-law.",
      "Assad and his wife have three children: Hafez, the PhD student, Zein and Karim.",
      "A 2022 US State Department report to Congress said the extended Assad family's net worth was between $1bn (\u00a3790m) and $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) - though it noted that it was difficult to estimate because their assets are \"believed to be spread out and concealed in numerous accounts, real estate portfolios, corporations, and offshore tax havens\".",
      "According to the report, Bashar and Asma maintained \"close patronage relationships with Syria's largest economic players, using their companies to launder money from illicit activities and funnel funds to the regime\".",
      "It also said that Asma had \"influence over the economic committee that manages Syria's ongoing economic crisis\" - and had made key decisions on Syria's \"food and fuel subsidies, trade and currency issues\".",
      "She also exerted influence over the Syria Trust for Development, through which most foreign aid for reconstruction in regime-held areas was channelled.",
      "In 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that Asma had \"become one of Syria's most notorious war profiteers\" with the help of her husband and her family.",
      "Another senior Trump administration official described her as the \"business head of the family\" and an \"oligarch\" who had been competing with Bashar's cousin Rami Makhlouf.",
      "He is one of Syria's richest men and the family rift became public knowledge after he posted videos on social media complaining about his treatment.",
      "Could Assad face prosecution?",
      "Following the fall of the Assad dynasty, Amnesty International's secretary general Agn\u00e8s Callamard said Syrians had been subjected to what she called \"a horrifying catalogue of human rights violations that caused untold human suffering on a vast scale\".",
      "This includes \"attacks with chemical weapons, barrel bombs, and other war crimes, as well as murder, torture, enforced disappearance and extermination that amount to crimes against humanity\".",
      "She called on the international community to ensure that people suspected of breaking international law and other serious human rights violations must be investigated and prosecuted for their crimes.",
      "On Tuesday, the Islamist rebel leader in Syria said any of the ousted regime's senior officials found to have been involved in torturing political prisoners would be named.",
      "Abu Mohammed al-Jolani also said his so-called Syrian Salvation Government would seek to repatriate officials it identified who fled to another country.",
      "In France, investigative judges have sought an arrest warrant for Assad for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity and war crimes, in connection with a deadly chemical attack in Syria in 2013 under the legal concept of universal jurisdiction.",

      "He is the fifth medic to kill themselves in Kenya in the last two months because of \"work-stress hardships and lack of responsive insurance cover\", according to Dr Davji Atellah, the secretary of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) - adding it was not something the union had ever recorded before.",

      "Njuki was among hundreds of interns who were posted to health facilities in August to do their mandatory one-year training to qualify.",

      "Trainees make up about 30% of doctors in the state health sector.",

      "Trainee doctors told the BBC that most medical schools do not adequately address the topic of suicide, leaving new and fatigued physicians poorly equipped to deal with traumatic ordeals - and this is compounded by poor pay.",
      "\"A healthy doctor builds a healthy nation. When I am stressed or depressed as a doctor, I might even forget how to perform resuscitation on a patient, which could lead to loss of life,\" said one intern doctor.",

    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates.",
      "With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up.",
      "Leaders of two southern states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu \u2013 have recently advocated more children.",
      "Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises.",
      "India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.",
      "Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.)",
      "The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s.",
      "Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries.",
      "But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.",
      "\"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC.",
      "Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976.",
      "This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom.",
      "Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation.",
      "Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.",
      "\"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\"",
      "The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli.",
      "This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves.",
      "But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.",
      "The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?",
      "Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report.",
      "In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\".",
      "Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift.",
      "Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.",
      "While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli.",
      "As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting.",
      "While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\".",
      "A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".",
      "\"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "This is already happening in some countries.",
      "In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.",
      "But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations.",
      "Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\".",
      "India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t want my last act on this planet to be a polluting act, if I can help that,\u201d Rachel Hawthorn explains.",
      "She  is getting ready to make her own burial shroud because she is concerned about the environmental impact of traditional burials and cremations.",
      "\u201cI try so hard in my life to recycle and to use less, and to live in an environmentally friendly way, so I want my death to be that as well,\" she adds.",
      "A gas cremation produces the estimated equivalent carbon dioxide emissions of a return flight from London to Paris and around 80% of those who die in the UK are cremated each year, according to a report from carbon consultancy firm, Planet Mark.",
      "But traditional burials can pollute too. Non-biodegradable coffins are often made with harmful chemicals and bodies are embalmed using formaldehyde: a toxic substance which can leach into soil.",
      "In a recent survey from Co-op Funeralcare, conducted by YouGov, one person in 10 said they would want a more 'eco-friendly' funeral.",
      "Rachel, from Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, made a burial shroud for a friend from locally-sourced wool, willow, bramble and ivy, as part of her work as an artist.",
      "For years she has explored the themes of death, dying, grief and nature through crafts and functional objects.",
      "But the 50-year-old sees the shroud, which can also remove the need for a coffin, as more than just artwork - and has since decided to make her own.",
      "A common reaction from those who have seen the creation is to ask if they can touch it, to feel how soft it is.",
      "For Rachel, it is the perfect way of helping people address the taboo topic of death.",
      "She also works as a death doula, which involves supporting people who are dying, as well as their loved ones, to make informed funeral care choices.",
      "\"I find that when we talk about death, everybody I've met finds it a helpful and healthy thing, and something that is life-enriching,\" she says.",
      "\u201cWhen somebody dies it is often so shocking. We just get on a treadmill of \u2018this is what happens\u2019, so I want to open up those conversations.",
      "\"I want more people to know there are options and that we don\u2019t have to end up in a box.\u201d",
      "The practice of digging graves to a depth of 6ft (1.82m) dates back at least to the 16th Century and is believed to have been a precaution against plague.",
      "When Rachel's time comes, she wants a natural burial, which means using a biodegradable coffin or shroud in a shallower grave. The upper layers of soil contain more active microbes, so bodies can decompose in about 20 to 30 years, rather than up to 100 in a traditional grave.",
      "Natural burial grounds are dotted across the UK and bear little resemblance to normal cemeteries \u2013 trees and wildflowers replace man-made grave markings, and no pesticides are used.",
      "Embalming, headstones, ornaments, and plastic flowers are not allowed.",
      "Louise McManus\u2019 mother was buried last year at Tarn Moor Memorial Woodland, a natural site near Skipton. The funeral included an electric hearse, locally made wool coffin and flowers from her garden.",
      "\u201cShe loved nature and being outside. She was concerned about what is happening to the environment and asked for her funeral to be as sustainable as possible,\u201d Louise says.",
      "Sarah Jones, the Leeds-based funeral director who organised the send-off, says demand for sustainability is growing.",
      "Her business has expanded to four premises since opening in 2016 with a rise in sustainable funerals helping to drive that expansion.",
      "She said from a \"handful\" of eco burials, such requests now make up about 20% of her business.",
      "\u201cMore and more people are asking about it and want to make choices that are better for the planet. They often feel it reflects the life of the person who has died because it was important to them,\" she says.",
      "As with many eco-friendly industries, natural burials can cost more. Many grounds, including Tarn Moor, offer cheaper plots to locals. One in Speeton, North Yorkshire, is community-run and puts profits back into the village playground.",
      "At Tarn Moor, a plot plus maintenance for Skipton residents costs \u00a31,177. Non-locals are charged \u00a31,818. The nearest council cemetery charges \u00a31,200 for a grave while cremation costs here start at \u00a3896.",
      "Often away from urban areas and transport links, travelling to  natural grounds for funerals, or to visit a grave, can involve a higher carbon footprint than more traditional sites, Planet Mark's report points out.",
      "Shroud-maker Rachel recognises these challenges but hopes for long-term change. She wants to see more local natural grounds and to normalise eco-friendly deathcare, while being respectful of others\u2019 choices.",
      "\u201cIn times gone by, women would arrive in their marital home with their shrouds as part of their dowry and they would be kept in the bottom drawer until they were needed,\" she says.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see why people can\u2019t have their burial shroud just ready and waiting for them.",
      "\u201cI think it could be that normal, but everybody does need to have their own choices around it. It doesn\u2019t have to be a certain way.\"",

      "Adnan found the hunger even harder than the beatings. \"I would go to sleep and wake up hungry,\" he says.",
      "\"There was a punishment that we received one month where one day they would pass us a slice of bread, the next day half a slice, until it was a tiny crumb. Then it was nothing. We got no bread.\"",

      "Two of the men we spoke to who were released on Sunday say they had contracted tuberculosis in Saydnaya - one said medication was frequently withheld as a form of punishment.",
      "But Adnan says the \"diseases from fear\" were even worse than the physical ones.",
      "At a hospital in Damascus this week, an official said brief medical checks of the detainees that were sent there had found \"mainly psychological problems\".",
      "These accounts paint a picture of a place with no hope, only pain.",

      "Qasem said they could hear what sounded like a helicopter taking off from the prison grounds before the men's shouts in the corridors. But in the windowless cell they couldn't be sure.",
      "Then the doors opened, and the freed inmates began running as fast as they could.",
      "\"We ran out of the prison. We ran from fear too,\" Rakan says, his thoughts on his young children and wife.",

      "\"I just kept going. I can't describe it. I just headed for Damascus. People were taking us from the road in their cars.\"",
      "He now fears each night when he goes to sleep that he will wake in the prison, and find it was all a dream.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "Once out of hospital, she was almost immediately being bombarded with unsolicited advice.",
      "There was \u201ctoo much talk, too much control around how I should raise the child. In a way that also affected my mind. It made me feel like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I wasn\u2019t given the chance to be a mother.\u201d",

      "In TikTok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a New York City sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.",
      "This fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.",
      "\"We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,\" said Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's.",
      "\"In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice.\"",

      "Once Mr Mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.",
      "The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.",

      "The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.",
      "Much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the \"hot assassin\".",
      "Indeed, Mr Mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton.",
      "Americans are effectively \"programmed\" to trust and empathise with men who look like Mr Mangione, he said.",
      "\"That's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.\"",

      "The internet has caused \"a blurring of the lines between celebrity and criminality\", she told the BBC, adding that when people see a good-looking person pop into their feeds, their first thought is lust, not moral criticism.",
      "\"The mood around Luigi Mangione is 'thirst',\" she said.",
      "Beyond his appearance, a large part of Mr Mangione's online appeal is clearly his apparent ire against the private healthcare industry and corporate elites in general. US media has reported that Mr Mangione was arrested carrying a handwritten document that said \"these parasites had it coming\".",
      "The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit extremism research group based in New Jersey, said that after the shooting the hashtag #EatTheRich went viral.",
      "Since Mr Mangione's arrest, variations of \"#FreeLuigi\" were posted on X over 50,000 times, likely getting tens of millions of impressions. And by some measures, the NCRI said, engagement with posts about Mr Thompson's killing across platforms like X, Reddit, and others surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July.",
      "An analysis of a sample of comments carried out by market research firm OneCliq found the vast majority - four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.",
      "Mr Mangione's X account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.",
      "The shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - \"wanted\" posters of other CEOs appeared around New York City, and a woman in Florida was arrested after telling an insurance agent on the phone \"Delay, Deny, Depose. You people are next,\" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.",
      "Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the NCRI, called the online reaction a \"turning point\" and \"a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes\".",
      "He compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.",
      "\"The dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, Discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,\" he said.",
      "Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at Notre Dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.",
      "\"People are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,\" he said. \"They're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect.\"",

      "\"I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,\" Pfizer's chief sustainability officer Caroline Roan told a conference in New York on Wednesday, according to Reuters.",
      "Some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about UHC took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.",
      "\"It's a horrific act of violence, and I absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,\" Jenn Coffey, who has been fighting to get UHC to cover her medical bills, said of Mr Thompson's killing. \"But I'm not shocked by the reaction.\"",

When a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her UHC insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. She has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group People's Action.",
      "Ms Coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. She said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.",
      "\"I get to have some normality. I can sit up and paint, or I can enjoy a meal with my family\" because of the treatment, she said. \"I can have a life that's worth living.\"",
      "UnitedHealth Group told the BBC they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.",
      "At the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, Brian Thompson, who was 50.",
      "\"It's incredibly bleak that [Thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,\" Blakely Thornton said.",
      "\"The collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy.\"",
      "In his last post on LinkedIn, Mr Thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, obtained a message that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty sent to staff this week, memorialising Mr Thompson and calling his murdered colleague \"one of the good guys\".",
      "\"He was certainly one of the smartest guys. I think he was one of the best guys. I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend,\" he wrote.",
      "In the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.",
      "\"I'm thankful to UHC and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,\" they wrote, according to the company.",
      "Another message said: \"So very sad that this world is so hateful. I have always had great experiences with UHC.\"",
      "Ms Coffey, the UHC policyholder and patient, said: \"My heart goes out to the family and I can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. It's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 11:55:18 GMT",
    "summary": "It is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor, writes Hugh Schofield.",
    "story": [
      "President Macron has turned to a fellow centrist, and one of France's most experienced politicians, to extricate the country from its crisis of government.",
      "But if Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou commands plenty of respect across the political spectrum, it is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor Michel Barnier.",
      "Appointed by the president as the constitution dictates, the prime minister can nonetheless only function with the support of parliament.",
      "And as the National Assembly is crippled by the same three-bloc impasse as it has been since July - with no possible change before July 2025 - it would be a rash punter who predicted for Bayrou any degree of success.",
      "Since the fall of Barnier a week ago - after a vote of no confidence supported by left and populist right - Macron has consulted with a range of leaders in the hope of forming a new informal coalition to run the country.",
      "Barnier having been a man of the traditional right, Macron's first instinct was to turn to the traditional left - and efforts initially focused on prising the Socialist Party (PS) from its alliance with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).",
      "However as the PS's condition was the adoption of leftwing policies that Macron was unwilling to sanction,  he was forced to limit his search to his own inner circle.",
      "Bayrou has been a close ally of the president since before Macron's first stunning election win in 2017. Indeed Bayrou's decision to stand aside as a candidate that year - and rally behind the younger man - created a vital dynamic behind Macron's campaign.",
      "A well-known figure on the political stage for more than 40 years,  Bayrou - who is 73 - has run the Modem party, which now has 36 deputies, since its formation in 2007. Before that he was the leader of other centrist incarnations.",
      "His beginnings were in the Chistian Democrat tradition of post-war politics, which in general supported but kept a distance from the larger Gaullist component of the French right, led from the late 1970s by Jacques Chirac.",
      "Bayrou, who was a teacher of classical languages in his 20s, served as education minister from 1993 to 1997. But that was his last meaningful experience of government.",
      "Very briefly in 2017 he was Macron's justice minister, but stepped down after being accused in a party funding scandal.",
      "He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but many of his colleagues were convicted. And prosecutors have appealed against his acquittal, meaning he could yet be brought back to court.",
      "An observant Catholic with six children, Bayrou's political base is in the Pyrenean city of Pau where he has been mayor since 2014. He speaks the local Bearnese language and is a strong believer in decentralisation.",
      "Bayrou has run for the presidency three times, as standard-bearer of the centre. He was closest to victory in 2007, when he came third with nearly 19% of the vote. He then angered the future winner Nicolas Sarkozy by coming out in support of the Socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal.",
      "When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides.",
      "His backing for Royal and then Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012 has established a certain trust among the Socialists. But his views on debt - and the need to bring it down - help him on the right.",
      "Interestingly his relationship with Marine Le Pen of the populist right is also respectful. In the past he has helped her collect the sponsorships needed to run for the presidency, arguing that it would be an affront to democracy if the leader of the most popular party could not stand.",
      "Similar sentiments led to support for Le Pen, when the prosecutor in her own party funding trial (a similar case to his own) recently demanded she be declared ineligible for public office.",
      "This may mean that Bayrou can avoid an automatic censure from the populist right.",
      "But Le Pen's National Rally has also warned that if the new prime minister is \"Barnier with another face\" it will not hesitate to bring him down.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 06:07:31 GMT",
    "summary": "India's top court is hearing petitions against a1991 law that protects the character of religious places.",
    "story": [
      "India's top court is hearing a number of petitions challenging a decades-old law that preserves the character and identity of religious places as they existed at the time of the country's independence in 1947.",
      "The law, introduced in 1991, prohibits converting or altering the character of any place of worship and prevents courts from entertaining disputes over its status, with the exception of the Babri Masjid case, which was explicitly exempted.",
      "The Babri Masjid, a 16th-Century mosque, was at the heart of a long-standing dispute, culminating in its demolition by a Hindu mob in 1992. A court verdict in 2019 awarded the site to Hindus for the construction of a temple, reigniting debates over India's religious and secular fault lines.",
      "The current petitions, including one from a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), argue that the 1991 law infringes on religious freedom and constitutional secularism.",
      "The hearing comes against the backdrop of Hindu groups filing cases to challenge the status of many mosques, claiming they were built over demolished Hindu temples.",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "Many, including opposition leaders and Muslim groups, have defended the law, saying it is crucial to safeguard the places of worship of religious minorities in a Hindu-majority India. They also question the nature of historical evidence presented by the petitioners in support of their claims.",
      "They say that if the law is struck down or diluted, it could open the floodgates for a slew of similar challenges and inflame religious tensions, especially between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court barred courts from registering fresh cases challenging the ownership of places of worship or ordering surveys to establish their character and identity until further notice. It is next set to hear the issue in February.",
      "Why was the law introduced?",
      "The law says that the religious character of any place of worship - temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras - must be maintained as it was on 15 August 1947, when Indian became independent.",
      "The Place of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 was brought in by the then-Congress party government while a movement - led by members of the Hindu nationalist BJP - to build a temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in the northern town of Ayodhya was getting stronger. The aggressive campaign triggered riots in several parts of the country and, according to some estimates, left hundreds dead.",
      "The violence was a painful reminder of the religious strife India had witnessed during partition in 1947.",
      "While introducing the bill in parliament, then home minister SB Chavan expressed anxiety about \"an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests\".",
      "These groups, he said, were resorting to \"forcible conversion\" of places of worship in an attempt to create new disputes.",
      "The BJP, then in the opposition, strongly opposed the bill, with some lawmakers walking out of parliament. An MP from the party said he believed the bill was brought in to appease the minorities and would only increase the rift between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "Apart from archaeological sites - whether religious or not - the only exception to the law was the Babri Masjid, as a legal challenge against the structure existed even before independence.",
      "Hindu mobs, however, demolished the mosque within months of the enactment of the law. In 2019, while awarding the disputed land to Hindu groups, India's Supreme Court said that the demolition of the mosque was an illegal act.",
      "Why does it keep making news?",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling on the law will be crucial to the fate of dozens of religious structures, especially those of Muslims, that are contested by Hindu groups. These include Gyanvapi and Shahi Eidgah, two disputed mosques in the holy cities of Varanasi and Mathura.",
      "Critics also point out that the historical nature of the sites will make it hard to conclusively establish divergent claims, leaving scope for bitter inter-religious battles and violence.",
      "While the hearing is being closely watched, the law also makes news whenever there is a fresh development in cases challenging mosques.",
      "Two weeks ago, a court in Rajasthan issued notices to the government after admitting a petition claiming that the revered Ajmer Sharif dargah - a 13th-Century Sufi shrine that attracts thousands of visitors every day - stood over a Hindu temple.",
      "And last month, four people were killed in Sambhal town in Uttar Pradesh state when violence broke out during a court-ordered survey of a 16th-Century mosque. Muslim groups have contested the survey in the Supreme Court.",
      "There have been tensions over other court-ordered surveys earlier, including in the case of the Gyanvapi mosque. Hindu groups said the 17th-Century mosque was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the partial ruins of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Muslim groups opposed the survey ordered by a local court, saying it violated the 1991 law.",
      "But in 2022, a Supreme Court bench headed by then chief justice DY Chandrachud did not stop the survey from going ahead. He also observed that the 1991 law did not prevent investigations into the status of a place of worship as of 15 August 1947, as long as it did not seek to alter it.",
      "Many have criticised this since then, with former civil servant Harsh Mander saying that it \"opened the floodgates for this series of orders by courts that run contrary to the 1991 law\".",
      "\"If you allow the survey of a mosque to determine if a temple lay below it, but then prohibit actions to restore a temple at that site, this is a surefire recipe for fostering resentment, hate and fear that could detonate for years in bitter feuds between people of diverse faiths,\" Mr Mander wrote.",
      "Thursday's Supreme Court order means that these surveys and ongoing court cases remain on hold for now.",

      "In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.",
      "The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called \"Pacific family\". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.",
      "If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.",

      "\"For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,\" he told reporters.",

      "Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.",

      "Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a \"thinning\" relationship between the two countries.",

      "\"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,\" he said. \"But in security, closer to home\u2026 our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed\u2026 together.\"",
      "Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as \"an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty\".",
      "Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging \"transactional\" dynamic in Pacific relations.",
      "\"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,\" Dr Murray said. \"For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.\"",
      "Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.",
      "\"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure\u2026 which is sort of what China is good at\u2026 [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,\" Mr Nobetau said.",

      "Ghana's former President John Mahama will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters following his landslide victory in Saturday's election.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",

    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.",

Now, we are getting \"An Evening with Dua Lipa,\" a special concert that reimagines all of her hit songs performed with a 53-piece orchestra at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall. The performance will air Sunday night on CBS and Paramount+.",
      "\"It was always on the top of my list of places that I've been dreaming to perform in. And I just love, you know, the theater element of the venue and how grand it is, but also very intimate,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",

      "Performing with the orchestra was a transformative experience for her.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",

      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",

If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",

    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

      "\"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX, has become a regular presence by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago, and spent $277 million to help get Trump elected.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Reddit, as well as major corporations who have donated to inaugural funds in the past, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, for information about their plans.",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

    "story": [
      "A House-passed bill that would expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans just got a lifeline in the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Chuck Schumer said Thursday he would start the process for a final vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, which would eliminate two federal policies that keep a portion of Americans from getting their full Social Security benefits, including cops, fire fighters and teachers.",
      "One living-and-breathing example is Terry Hoover, a firefighter in Louisville, Kentucky, for more than 20 years. Now retired, he says these two provisions cost his family more than $1,000 a month.",
      "\"My Social Security is reduced due to my pension,\" Hoover, told fellow first responders at a rally earlier in the week, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by a local CBS affiliate. \"And then my wife, she was a nurse for 41 years and paid into the Social Security system, you know, and I cannot draw one penny off of her because of my pension.\"",
      "Schumer, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the legislation,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the bill would \"ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.\" As majority leader, he can invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "That's important, as the clock is ticking as to its fate, with only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Decades in the making, the bill would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said of the proposal, which the league supports. \"We're guardedly optimistic,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch earlier in the month.",
      "The bill had 62 cosponsors when the Senate version was introduced last year, and would now need at least 60 votes to pass Congress and then head to President Biden.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy took to the Senate floor to call for a vote in the chamber. \"If Schumer brings it up, it'll pass,\" said Cassidy, among its Republican sponsors.",
      "Will the Senate pass the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill next week. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Opposition includes the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact. In a statement responding to Schumer's announcement, the group's president, Maya MacGuineas, said it was \"truly astonishing\" that lawmakers would consider speeding up the trust fund's demise.",
      "The measure would increase the burden on Social Security's trust funds, which are already estimated to not be able to pay the full amount of scheduled benefits starting in 2035. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "\"The Senate should reject WEP and GPO repeal. Instead, they should come together to try to fix the issues with WEP and GPO as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen Social Security, prevent insolvency and make the program's finances sustainable over the long term,\" MacGuineas urged.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a vote of 327-75 last month.",

The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, last month said it discovered the accounting issue on one of its accrual accounts while preparing its quarterly financial statements.",
      "The company revealed new details on the incident Wednesday, saying that an independent investigation found that \"a single employee with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries and falsified underlying documentation,\" according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.",
      "Adrian Mitchel, chief operating officer and chief financial officer at Macy's, said the error \"was not theft\" and that \"there was no impact to revenues, and there was no impact to cash or inventories as all vendors were fully paid.\"",
      "The company said is overhauling its controls over financial reporting.",
      "Department stores struggling",
      "Macy's isn't alone in shuttering brick-and-mortar locations. The retailer's\u00a0acceleration of store closures comes as department stores struggle, with fewer shoppers visiting malls and more Americans making purchases online.",
      "U.S. retailers have announced more than 7,100 store closures through the end of November 2024. That represents a 69% jump from the same time last year, according to recent data from research firm CoreSight. Forty-five retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection so far this year, compared with 25 retail bankruptcies in all of 2023, the report found.",
      "Macy's, meanwhile, is betting on the success of its other brands, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. It plans to open 15 Bloomingdale's stores and 30 Bluemercury locations over the next three years, while also remodeling about 30 existing Bluemercury stores, the company said.",

    "title": "Here's what Trump's plans to extend his tax cuts could mean for you",
    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 13:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the law firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",

But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",

      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",

      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",

      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

Yet Family Dollar, which has had widespread closures this year, has failed to attract price-sensitive shoppers while its stores offer \"a poor selling environment,\" Saunders said in a Dec. 4 research note.",
      "The retail landscape might stabilize next year, although there are likely to be additional closures in 2025, he added.",
      "\"Retailers are trying to get their finances and operations in order. This has been a year of change after several years of disruption,\" he noted. \"I think these things tend to go in cycles and we are currently in a bit of a down cycle for store closings.\"",

      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",

The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said.

If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them.

    "story": [
      "The premier of Canada's most populous province on Wednesday threatened to cut off energy supplies to the U.S. if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposed tariffs on Canadian goods. This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",

      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",

Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",

      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",

      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

      "The Federal Reserve has been battling high inflation since 2022, when it began ratcheting up its benchmark rate in order to dampen demand from consumers and businesses. That's helped lower the inflation rate to its current level from a recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022, yet the last leg of the Fed's journey to push inflation down to a 2% annual rate is proving elusive.",
      "\"This is the second month in a row that the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index has increased. Prices rose by 0.3% between October and November,\" noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email after the report was released.",
      "She added, \"Since May 2023, wages have been rising faster than inflation, which is the main reason why persistently higher inflation has not slowed overall consumer spending.\"",
      "But the impact of high consumer prices is pinching many families, she added. \"Recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that moderate-income families are experiencing the strain of inflation much more than higher-income households,\" Sturtevant added.",
      "Problem areas: Shelter and grocery prices",
      "Pinch points for consumers last month were shelter prices \u2014 rent and housing costs \u2014 as well as food, according to the CPI data. Housing prices have proved particularly sticky since the pandemic, with home prices, rents and mortgage rates all rising significantly in recent years.",
      "The increase in shelter costs contributed about 40% of the CPI increase last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.",
      "Food prices also rose last month, with groceries increasing 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, the BLS said.",
      "\"Shelter costs continue to be the number one source for higher prices, and that the rate of increase has slowed is no comfort,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"Many food prices rose, including the proxy for that category, eggs, up about 8% for the month.\"",
      "He added, \"This report may show a mild increase in the grand scheme, and should guarantee another rate cut when the Fed meets next week, but especially for lower-income Americans it's adding to the harsh burden of high costs.\"",
      "Fed's December rate meeting",
      "That stalling may complicate the Fed's current rate-cutting path. In September, the central bank issued its first cut in four years, followed by a second reduction in November, citing progress on inflation and weakness in the job market.",
      "While a majority of economists still forecast the Fed will again cut rates at its next meeting, set for Dec. 18, some forecasters are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",

    "summary": "Andrew Ferguson, who is already one of the FTC's five commissioners, will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod\u200b for Wall Street and Silicon Valley.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump made another flurry of job announcements on Tuesday, selecting Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Ronald Johnson was nominated to be ambassador to Mexico and\u00a0Kimberly Guilfoyle to be ambassador to Greece.",
      "Trump was also expected to select Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta as ambassador to Italy, CBS News learned.",
      "Ferguson, who is already one of the FTC's five commissioners, will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior.",
      "\"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History.\"",
      "Fertitta, meanwhile, the billionaire CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc., is Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Italy, people familiar with the decision told CBS News Tuesday. Trump transition officials declined to comment.",
      "Fertitta is a friend of Trump's and longtime GOP donor who leads Landry's Inc., a Texas-based corporation with hotels, restaurants and casinos. He starred in a reality TV show on CNBC called \"Billion Dollar Buyer\" and owns more than 600 properties in 36 states and in over 15 countries, according the company's website, including the iconic Golden Nugget Casino, Morton's The Steakhouse, the Palm Restaurant and Joe's Crab Shack.",
      "Fertitta joined Trump and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u00a0for a Starship rocket launch\u00a0in Texas in November.",
      "Tom Barrack was chosen as the nominee for ambassador to Turkey. Barrack, a wealthy financier, met Trump in the 1980s while helping negotiate Trump's purchase of the renowned Plaza Hotel. He was charged with using his personal access to the former president to secretly promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates, but was acquitted of all counts at a federal trial in 2022.",
      "Trump called him a \"well-respected and experienced voice of reason.\"",
      "Johnson \u2014 not the Republican senator \u2014 served as ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration. His nomination comes as the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign and became engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her \"a close friend and ally\" and praised her \"sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.\" Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.",
      "\"I am so proud of Kimberly. She loves America and she always has wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador. She will be an amazing leader for America First,\" Don Jr. posted.",
      "The ambassador positions must be approved by the U.S. Senate.",
      "Guilfoyle said in a social media post that she was \"honored to accept President Trump's nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "Trump also announced Tuesday that he had selected Jacob Helberg as the next undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, and Dan Bishop as deputy director for budget at the Office of Budget and Management.",
      "The replacement of Khan at the FTC likely means that the commission will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection divisions.",
      "\"These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,\" wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland & Knight, in a recent analysis.",
      "Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command.",
      "For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.",
      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",

    "summary": "The 93-year-old media mogul has argued family trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent.",
    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper that his client and his client's son were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James Murdoch said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that they welcome the ruling and hope that their family can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \"The effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch's favor after Rupert Murdoch's passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",

      "\"Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump,\" Waltz said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine.\"",
      "Orb\u00e1n, an authoritarian leader with ties to Russia, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week, along with Waltz and Elon Musk. Days after the meeting, Orb\u00e1n announced that he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that \"we are taking every possible diplomatic step to argue in favor of a ceasefire\" and peace talks. He later appeared to float a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Waltz wouldn't say whether Orb\u00e1n's message to Putin came out of the meeting with Trump. But he noted that \"we're going to continue to talk,\" and that \"President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.\"",
      "\"We need to stop the fighting,\" Waltz said. \"If that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll take a hard look at what that means.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged that he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine immediately upon returning to the White House while claiming that Putin would never have invaded the country if he were president. Waltz said that since Trump's victory in the election, the framework of discussion with world leaders surrounding the war between Russia and Ukraine has shifted to talk of how the conflict comes to an end.",
      "\"How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just a pause?\" Waltz said. \"Those are all things that we're thinking through.\"",
      "The meeting with Orb\u00e1n came after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Dec. 7 in Paris after which Trump called for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to begin.",
      "Zelenskyy said following the president's statement that the war \"cannot simply end with a piece of paper and a few signatures.\" And though he said he had a \"good meeting\" with Trump, he warned that a ceasefire \"without guarantees can be reignited at any moment.\"",
      "The Biden administration announced last week it would be sending another package of weapons to Ukraine, valued at $500 million, according to Reuters. Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova, also appearing on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said that her country's ability to fight off Russian forces is \"still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.\"",
      "But Markarova noted \"we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.\"",

      "\"We should have some kind of an outside board that governors have,\" she said. \"Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night.\"",

And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and \u2013 and it's \u2013 it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here.",
      "And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is \u2013 is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced.",
      "We need to know who's behind it. But, right now, I think law enforcement seems to be \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So, when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low-level, long-loitering, could-be-dangerous drones?",
      "And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following prepositioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore.",
      "And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to have an all-of-the-above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Let \u2013 let me ask you about China. The president-elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been talking and discussing, as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping.",
      "CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back-and-forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing.",
      "I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So, the outreach has been tremendous.",
      "President Trump is taking all calls. As you know, he believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head-of-state level. And those conversations \u2013 those conversations are ongoing, but they are really nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties.",
      "We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but, as I have said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans.",
      "Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated.",
      "You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are \u2013 we have been over the years trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber.",
      "We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation-state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that, even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.",
      "That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And then, finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is this sanctions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one.",
      "But taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar-a-Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself.",
      "He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orban seems to be floating a Christmas cease-fire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orban has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump.",
      "And I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in Eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 this is World War I-style \u2013 this is World War I-style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings.",
      "President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of cease-fire as a first step, again, we'll \u2013 we'll take a hard look at what that means.",
      "But, until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so no message was sent through Orban to Putin by Trump? Is that \u2013 that's what I understand you saying there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to \u2013 yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of back-and-forths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: But one is talking. Of course, we're going to continue to talk. And President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check \u2013 in his interview with \"TIME\" magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't \u2013 you know, just isn't a strategy, this just kind of forever war that we seem to be backing into.",
      "What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table? And what's the framework for \u2013 for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45-minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know, what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to \u2013 that framework I just talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just \u2013 not just a pause?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Those are all things that we're thinking through.",
      "And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO secretary-general came here to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: He's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in \u2013 whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East.",
      "During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014.",
      "President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. Thousands of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're, importantly, taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And, you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained.",
      "So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And we'll see moving forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Mike Waltz, thank you for joining us today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Great to be back on, Margaret. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",
      "I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A man who committed tax fraud\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: It reminded me, isolation prison in Denesk, which still is operational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: So, look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it at any time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",

In the main suuk (ph), shoppers walked on Assad's face. While at Saydnaya Prison, where his critics were tortured and killed, crowds poured in to what Syrians used to call the slaughterhouse.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme): Well, our deliveries so far have been very - very smooth. But we need more delivery options open, which is what this was eluding to.",
      "More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this - this month so far, but we need more. And - and, more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking.",
      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game. And you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide.",
      "Have you seen any change to that?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of need you're looking for. Seventeen billion is the number you are asking for.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and first Trump administration economic adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary, and we're back now with the Vice Chairman of IBM Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House Economic Advisor in President Trump's first term. Gary, welcome back. It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the President's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN: \u00a0 Margaret, thanks for having me. You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7% on consumer prices. Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2%, so we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2% where the Fed would like to get to. That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly- it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points. Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 So the President's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth, we have real wage growth. And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year. Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation. So the economy the President's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive. Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that will actually happen?",
      "COHN: I do think it's going to happen. So net, net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark. It's a- it's an index, it's a benchmark. And remember, the stock market is an index. There's a- there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end that are performing very, very well, and there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn. Gary, before the break, you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So you helped put together the tax plan that's expiring in 20- or part of it expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21%. He really wanted to get it back down to 15 and \"we will be able to do that.\" Will he be able to do that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it. When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time in 2025, you are given instructions by the- by the Budget Committee, They instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you could take in. This time, it will be how much money you can spend. We did not have additional money to spend, so the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21%. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation in 2017 expires the end of 2025, to score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025. So we do know that taxes will be taken up by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation, because if not, the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code. That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants, on either side of the aisle, wants to go back to the prior tax code. You know, when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side, because the vast majority of companies in the United States are small businesses that file on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate, and you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of out of- out of line with each other, so people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter S corporation versus a corporation, so they can take advantage of the tax code. So there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I think you've said in the past, though you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, the business community as a whole, when we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the Business Roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21% tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23% or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN::: Other developed economies.",
      "COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically, we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domiciled companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The pick for Treasury Secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, social security, overtime pay. Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look, Scott is quite an accomplished individual. So look, I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies. There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these promises--",
      "COHN: I agree with that, but we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy, continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you heard the House Speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote. They're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, and do it in kind of an arcane way. When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and I don't know, this could change anyway, there's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy on this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority, budget-related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill, which is border related, where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration, and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes?",
      "COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there, as there were in the Biden administration, use that to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's a big fight to have in the year ahead. Gary, we will be talking to you again, then. We've got to take a break. Thank you."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be back on Margaret, thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record and you actually co-sponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them. Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this, and why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency and three, I appreciated some of the Congressman's words, because what he is talking about is we need to have a new regulatory rules in place here. Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities, and then we've got to figure out, do we really want all these drones, because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future, and they have to be within 400 feet, so these things are going to be what? Flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these. So I think I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be. No one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Republican controlled Senate?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on. You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration, and you'll get to question his selectee to run the FBI Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution. I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI: The approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line-up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record, as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees. Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice. She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So we have to do our due diligence and make decisions. I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency, and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here. And so when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied- he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity. And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission when we should be on a national security safety mission here, when we look at cyber security attacks that you just talked to the congressman about and various other things. He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them, but in the end, it's their decision to demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own. I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1500 Americans more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so called \"Cash for kids\" scheme\u2013",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I did not like that one. Nope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013that sent thousands to jail for millions of dollars, a man who committed tax fraud at a cost of more than $1.6 billion described as \"the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepented tax cheat in U.S. history,\" a woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare. Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles was also commuted. So the way I look at is this- I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son. I also have not agreed with a number of pardons that President Trump gave. So I believe, and I've long advocated for this, that while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that right? Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the army, things like that. That's been going on a long time, but we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House. This makes no sense to me\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category and not the specifics of the case. Was that prudent?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so, I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group. Okay, let's say that. Now I believe that there were, but there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So instead of doing a whole category, why don't in a coming year before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these, that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them based on the facts, instead of just in a large group. So large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just, I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because otherwise you undermine the justice system. And again, I emphasize, this also happened in a big way under President Trump, and you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more face than nation. Stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, Trump's pick for national security adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, who is the incoming White House National Security Adviser. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Morning. Margaret. Tough day for Army, but great day for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well as a Green Beret, I know you had a reason to be cheering there for Army, Sir. I want to ask you a number of topics, but before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department. And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and- and it's- it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is- is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced. We need to know who's behind it. But right now, I think law enforcement seems to be- the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low level, long loitering, could-be-dangerous drones? And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following pre-positioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore. And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles. We need to have an all of the above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Let- let me ask you about China. The President Elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been \"talking and discussing,\" as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping. CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back and forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing. I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So the outreach has been tremendous. President Trump is taking all calls, as you know. He believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head of state level. And those conversations- those conversations are ongoing, but they are, really, nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties. We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but as I've said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans. Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated. You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ\u00a0 I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are- we have been, over the years, trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber. We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense. The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point. And then finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is this sanctions?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: \u2014us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one, but taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off, is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar a Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself. He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n seems to be floating a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump, and I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style-",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings. President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll- we'll take a hard look at what that means. But until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no message was sent through Orb\u00e1n to Putin by Trump. Is that- that's what I understand you saying there.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to- yeah, I'm not going to get into specifics of back and forths. But, one is talking, of course, we're going to continue to talk, and the- President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check, in his interview with Time magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't- you know, just isn't a strategy. This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into. What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what's the framework for- for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45 minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to- that framework I just talked about. How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just- not just a pause? Those are all things that we're thinking through. And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO Secretary General came here to Mar a Lago, he's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in- whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East. During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014. President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. 1000s of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're importantly taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody. And you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term, and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained. So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration, and we'll see moving forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Executive Director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme Cindy McCain. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, you are looking at a globe very much in crisis, but I want to start on the hot spot of Syria. USAID said the World Food Programme was able to reach 70,000 people in Syria over the last week, but you need supply lines to remain open. Is there a threat right now to your deliveries? And if so, where is that coming from?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, our deliveries so far have been very- very smooth, but we need more delivery options open, which is what this was alluding to. More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this- this month so far, but we need more. And- and more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking. We had- there's a lot of people, a lot of hunger at stake, a lot of malnutrition that was already pre-existing, that now- that now we need to handle as well. You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there, but now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get, not just more trucks, but more people in, so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you need Turkey to open up supply lines or surrounding countries? Is that right?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, correct. We need everybody around us, Turkey, all the countries surrounding us, to make sure that we can get in and get in smoothly, again, unfettered and, of course, in a safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you're trying to scale up to reach nearly 3 million people who need some help right now. The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "MCCAIN: Not really. We've- we've been able to, as- as you said, we've been able to move our goods, through, our food items, etc, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But- but I don't- I will never understate- underestimate the process with things that it could infringe us later on. So I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods again in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed. And that's the most important part that we need too, we need access, and we need the ability to feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now, if you want to know the truth. There's so much, there's so many- many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings. No one's paying any attention to it. Syria being one of them. And we need- we need, obviously, a great deal of funds in- in particular within Syria, but in other countries too. You're talking about Sudan, we're talking about Yemen, we're talking about Ethiopia and other places where- where people are desperate right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah. Countries are- are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing- choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. We- you know, we- I always send out the oral plea to be able to- to encourage people and encourage countries to be- to get involved and to stay involved. And I'm asking now, I'm asking on your show, worldwide, to please consider, once again, giving to Syria, because people in Syria will starve to death without it, and- and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations, and you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game, and you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide. Have you seen any change to that?",
      "MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now, and hunger- hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide, and it does affect national security. So it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S., as- as we just said, the most generous here, the president-elect has selected a rising star in the Republican Party, Elise Stefanik, to be the representative at the United Nations, and also a cabinet member. That indicates an important voice at the table. Congressman Stefanik- Congresswoman Stefanik called for a complete reassessment of U.S. funding for the United Nations. Are you concerned that you will see a negative impact on funding?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm not concerned, because when I came into this job, I knew that funding was not going to be at the level that it had been. So we've gone through a complete- complete reboot on not only scaling down our operations and making sure that we're more efficient, more effective, and- and making sure that our people in- we push everything to this- to the- to the field now, so that our people in the field can get the job done. We- this was something I came in knowing I was going to have to do, is scale down, make sure that- that we work better, more efficiently, more effectively, and make sure that we get food to the people that need it the most in a quick and safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We- right now, we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly, Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where- where famine does exist, as you know, it's been declared there. And we need- we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can- can access from that direction as well. It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in, but we need more. People are starving to death, and once again, it's- it's- I sound like a broken record, but we need to be able to get in in a safe and unfettered- unfettered manner, so that we can get the job done. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that because if people are insecure from a food- from- from a food reality, they're not going to behave well, and things- they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this. The countries that are affected right now, and the big ones that we- that we look to, are all affected because of conflict. It's- the food security issue is- is very directly caused by conflict within the arena that they're in. So it's very important that we pay attention to that particular issue as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Given the- the scale of the famine and the malnutrition in Sudan, is it food that you're trying to bring in, or is it more, you know, specialized medical assistance? How do you deal with the children, for example, who are being so hurt in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, yes, part of that is making sure that- that our folks from UNICEF, our folks from W.H.O. can get in because there are specialized and- specialized products that are needed for, especially the infants, that are so severely- severely malnourished. And it's our job to help not just get our stuff in, but get their stuff in as well, in any way that we can. We're a team player in all this, and we make sure that we- we access and talk to all of our partners within the field so that we can work together. Yes. I mean, these are these- these people, and these children especially, have been so deprived of nourishment for so long that they need highly-specialized items to be able- to be able to beat malnutrition and at least have some chance at life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's- what's going on. Listen- this- we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know- and of course, now we're into December. But so- the- the- the inability for us to not only to- to move our trucks and get it to where it needs to go, but the insecurity that's caused from it, the- the- the targeting of- of humanitarian aid workers and making sure that we can't move or that- or that they feel insecure. This whole- this whole issue of not being able to get in, is- is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire, and we need it now. We can't- there's- we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of- of crowds just crushing people, amassing at bakeries in Gaza. 90% of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is man-made.",
      "MCCAIN: It is man-made, you're- you're absolutely right. It is man-made and and- and more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just- not just do they need food, but we need access. And the targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job, and- and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. Children, especially, are starving to death. I mean, the height of malnutrition, the height of- of hunger within- within that region, is- is unbelievably horrible, and so we've seen it firsthand. And I- I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are- I'm calling for a cease-fire, and I want my aid, my fellow partners within this arena, to call for the same thing. We need a cease-fire. We need access, and we need it now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You used the word--",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 -- Again, remember, food security is national security, and that's what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running, if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the- the lawlessness. There is absolutely no- no law- law to be held, you know, to be even talked about there, because it doesn't exist. And so we need all of those kinds of things to be put into place so that we can work in a safe manner and get- get the food to where it's go- where it needs to go. Again, we've gotten two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of needs. You're looking for 17 billion is the number you are asking for. We wish you good luck feeding the world.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "\"We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now,\" McCain said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that \"hunger is at the forefront of all of this.\"",
      "McCain outlined that with food insecurity, people don't \"behave well, and things \u2014 they start to migrate.\"",
      "\"Wars begin that way,\" she said. \"Conflict is a part of all of this.\"",
      "Among the areas where the World Food Programme is at work is Syria, which has been thrown into a period of uncertainty after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad\u00a0last week.

But she said the organization is seeing \"evidence of great hunger\" in the country, while noting that without funding, people will \"starve to death.\"",
      "McCain said the effort could use $17 billion worldwide, saying there are \"so many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings.\"",
      "\"No one's paying any attention to it,\" she added.",
      "McCain outlined the \"complicated situation\" in Sudan, with a slow process to access parts of the country, including places where famine has been declared.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good to have you back with us.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No Western Power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelensky said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, so and we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support. Yesterday, we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the word about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already, and we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look we we see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions. So it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this axis of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kursk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in Modern Warfare, and they're learning in Ukraine- I mean, right there.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this and Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raised the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military Recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up this fight?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have, first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine, and they are volunteering, and women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces. With the recruitment, the last changes to the law on mobilization already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on, so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Korean to unprepared Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us, because every person matters for Ukrainians. Of course there are challenges, and we have the plan and we know how to do it, because again, this is our home we are defending. So when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country, but weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3000 Glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us.",
      "There's missiles for both Russian and North Korean missiles. I mean, it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone. But Donald Trump gave an interview to Time Magazine, and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons- missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, let me say, start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually, to provide us with lethal aid in the first place\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013back in 2017.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes. So right now, we have to do everything in order to stop Russia. And we know it's- it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50% that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea, just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could, they- we can stop them the more equipment we have, especially including the longer range equipment in order to be able to degrade the attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table, because, again, Ukraine wants peace. Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict, and we negotiated at the first sign- remember, in 2022 when Russians started negotiations, they, of course, did not negotiate peace. They negotiated the pause. As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be but we do know that Viktor Orban was at Mar-a-Lago this past week, and he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter, after Russia destroyed our- a lot of our energy infrastructure. And after you know, we are going through this difficult fights, both on the front line, but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Just this past week.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, at the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying, and we see they were not able to defend their body- terrorist body Assad, and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Sednaya Prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere. It reminded me isolation prison in Donetsk\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Which still is operational. So look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it anytime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment."

      "Washington \u2014 Tech leaders and companies are shelling out big bucks to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, as they prepare for the next four years of a Trump White House.",
      "Amazon, run by billionaire Jeff Bezos, intends to donate $1 million to the president-elect's inaugural fund and will stream the ceremony on Prime, amounting to another $1 million in-kind donation, according to a source familiar with the donations. The Wall Street Journal first reported Amazon's plans.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also plans to send $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump's inaugural fund, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. Fox News Digital first reported Altman's intended donation.",
      "\"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX, has become a regular presence by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago, and spent $277 million to help get Trump elected.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Reddit, as well as major corporations who have donated to inaugural funds in the past, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, for information about their plans.",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",

      "Chesebro pleaded guilty in October 2023 to a conspiracy to file false documents charge. He was sentenced under Georgia's First Offender Act, which allows the charge to drop off his record if he successfully completes probation with no violations.",
      "Earlier this month, Chesebro's attorney asked Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to throw out the plea after he dismissed the charge Chesebro pleaded guilty to. His attorneys argued the plea should be thrown out because it violates his rights to due process.",
      "But McAfee dismissed the motion calling it, \"procedurally defective in more ways than one.\" He noted that Chesebro \"has already submitted a plea in response to this indictment \u2014 one of guilt.\"",
      "He also said that Chesebro's motion was not a \"valid motion in arrest of judgment\" \u2014 Chesebro was calling on McAfee to stop the judgment because of a defect. McAfee pointed out that under the First Offender Act, Chesebro had pleaded guilty before \"an adjudication of guilt\" and \"without entering a judgment of guilt.\" So, McAfee reasoned in the ruling, \"No final judgment occurs \u2026.Therefore, there can be no arrest of judgment here.\"",
      "The indictment accused Chesbro of proposing, in a memo to Trump allies, \"a bold, controversial strategy\" to overturn the election: appoint alternate electors loyal to Trump in several states.",
      "This proposal and at least one other memo he penned were included in the Georgia indictment as overt acts \"in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The seven original counts against him stemmed from the plan to submit a slate of fake electors from Georgia.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court said it will wade into a case over whether California can set its own vehicle emissions standards under a scheme laid out in the Clean Air Act.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will wade into a case over whether California can set its own vehicle emissions standards under a scheme laid out in the Clean Air Act.",
      "The case involves a section of the law that preempts states from setting their own emissions standards for new vehicles. But the act exempts any state that had rules in place before March 1966, just after the law was amended to regulate automobile emissions, that are \"at least as protective of public health and welfare\" as the federal requirements.",
      "California was the only state that regulated vehicle emissions before 1966, and therefore is the only state eligible for a waiver. In order to obtain a waiver, California must show that it needs its own emission standards \"to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" The Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt California's vehicle emissions standards.",
      "Since the Clean Air Act was enacted, the EPA has granted California more than 75 waivers for its vehicle emissions program. In 1993, the agency granted a waiver for the state's zero emission vehicle standards. It did so again in 2019 for California's first set of greenhouse-gas emissions standards.",
      "In 2012, California put in place the Advanced Clean Car standards, which aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and other pollutants by increasing requirements for zero- and low-emission vehicle sales in the state for model years 2015 through 2025. The standards govern all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles.",
      "The EPA issued a waiver to California for those regulations in 2013, and car manufacturers started working to comply with the new emissions standards. But the agency revoked the waiver as to the zero-emissions and greenhouse gas requirements during the Trump administration in 2019. In 2022, under President Biden, it was reinstated again.",
      "The EPA said at the time that California is \"particularly impacted\" by climate change, citing\u00a0 wildfires, heat waves, floods and droughts. These climate change impacts are \"compelling and extraordinary conditions,\" the standard for a waiver under the Clean Air Act, the agency said.",
      "Several big automakers, including Volvo, Stellantis, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda, have all agreed to comply with California's more stringent vehicle standards.",
      "A group of 17 states, led by Ohio, and fuel companies asked the federal appeals court in Washington to review the EPA's reinstatement of the 2013 waiver. The states argued the waiver provision in the Clean Air Act violates the Constitution by treating California differently from the other states, while the fuel producers said they are harmed by California's requirements because they depress the demand for their product by requiring vehicle manufacturers to sell automobiles that use less or no liquid gas.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the EPA in April. As to the states, the court found that Congress has been granted the authority to regulate interstate commerce, including vehicle emissions, and it was the legislative body that laid out the Clean Air Act's preemption and waiver scheme. The three-judge panel also said the fuel producers did not have the legal right to sue.",
      "\"The nature and extent of equality between the states has been a central debate throughout our country's history, from the founding to the admission of new states and beyond,\" D.C. Circuit said in an unsigned opinion. \"But state petitioners point us to no meaningful support for their novel request to apply the equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\"",
      "Both the companies and the states appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the D.C. Circuit's decision is incompatible with the Constitution because Congress doesn't have the power to elevate a single state above the other 49.",
      "The Supreme Court said Friday it would review only whether fuel producers can point to the waiver's effect on automakers to show they have standing to sue. The justices declined to review whether the EPA's waiver for California is unlawful.",
      "California and the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to turn down the case and uphold the Clean Air Act's waiver provision.",
      "The dispute is one of several to land before the Supreme Court in recent years involving the Clean Air Act and efforts to tackle air pollution.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court blocked the agency's so-called \"good neighbor\" plan, which aims to curb air pollution and address harmful smog. Two years earlier, in the summer of 2022, the high court found Congress didn't grant the EPA the authority under the Clean Air Act to set emissions caps based on the generation-shifting approach taken through the Clean Power Plan rule.",
      "But in cases that have arrived before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, the justices have declined to intervene. In a trio of disputes, the high court temporarily allowed the EPA to continue enforcing more stringent standards on emissions from coal-fired power plants and new and existing oil and gas facilities.",

      "Get ready for the final full moon of 2024: the Cold Moon.",
      "Skywatchers who want to see it at its fullest should be prepared to head out this weekend \u2014 the December full moon will reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. EST on Sunday, Dec. 15.",
      "But if being out in the predawn hours seems unlikely for you Sunday, you don't necessarily need to catch it exactly at the peak. The moon will appear full for several days. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",
      "Other names for December's moon include the Drift Clearing Moon, the Frost Exploding Trees Moon, the Moon of the Popping Trees, Hoar Frost Moon, Snow Moon and Winter Maker Moon, according to the almanac.",
      "How long will December's moon be full?",
      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14. The agency said 100% will be illuminated on Dec. 15. On Dec. 16, 98% of the moon will still be illuminated.",
      "This month, NASA also suggests keeping an eye out for Jupiter, sitting between the nearly full moon and Aldebaran, the brightest star in the Taurus constellation, on Dec. 14.",
      "NASA says you won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the view of the Cold Moon. Local forecasts have detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in different locations where people are keeping an eye out for the moon.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the best meteor showers of the year is about to peak. Here's how to watch and where you can catch the Geminids.",
    "story": [
      "The Geminids, considered one of the best and most reliable meteor showers of the year, is underway and is set to peak Friday night into early Saturday.",
      "The shower will peak under a nearly full moon, which could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge. The light from the moon will wash out the fainter meteors during the peak, according to NASA.",
      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",
      "With the bright moon on peak night, an observer in the U.S. may see around 15 Geminids an hour, Cooke said.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "The Geminid meteor shower is visible around the world and throughout the night sky. For optimal viewing conditions, head somewhere far away from city and street lights, then lie down flat on your back with your feet pointed south. Give your eyes half an hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "NASA advises bringing a sleeping bag or blanket to help with the cold while waiting for the Geminids.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m., with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",
      "Most meteors burn up in space. The few that survive the trip and reach the ground and considered meteorites.",
      "What makes the Geminids different from other meteor showers?",
      "The Geminids are one of the strongest meteor showers of the year, with a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, according to NASA.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids actually come from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. NASA researchers say the asteroid acts like a \"weird\" comet.",
      "And while NASA says most meteors appear to be colorless or white, the Geminids are usually yellow in color.",
      "The annual Geminids meteor shower first appeared in the mid-1800s.",

    "title": "Learning from the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",

      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them.

      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order. Last month, Cruise agreed to an additional $500,000 fine after admitting to filing a false report following the San Francisco pedestrian crash.",

      "\"We should have some kind of an outside board that governors have,\" she said. \"Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of cease-fire as a first step, again, we'll \u2013 we'll take a hard look at what that means.",
      "But, until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so no message was sent through Orban to Putin by Trump? Is that \u2013 that's what I understand you saying there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to \u2013 yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of back-and-forths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: But one is talking. Of course, we're going to continue to talk. And President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check \u2013 in his interview with \"TIME\" magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't \u2013 you know, just isn't a strategy, this just kind of forever war that we seem to be backing into.",
      "What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table? And what's the framework for \u2013 for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45-minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know, what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to \u2013 that framework I just talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just \u2013 not just a pause?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Those are all things that we're thinking through.",
      "And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO secretary-general came here to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: He's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in \u2013 whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East.",
      "During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014.",
      "President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. Thousands of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're, importantly, taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And, you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained.",
      "So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And we'll see moving forward.",

      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Great to be back on, Margaret. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",

      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",

      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",

      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",

Thick fog spread across much of the state, reducing visibility to 1/4 of a mile or less in some places, the weather service said.

The Washington County Sheriff's Office said a 57-year-old woman was killed in a crash after losing control of her pickup truck on Highway 30, near Arlington, and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor injuries in the accident. Washington County is located close to the eastern Nebraska border with Iowa, near Omaha.",

    "story": [
      "Some of you may have already completed your holiday shopping, but most of us are normal.\u00a0 If you are like me, over the next couple weeks you'll have the following thought: \"Oh, I should probably get that person a present.\"",
      "Maybe it will be for a friend, a neighbor, or a business associate. If you don't get them a present, it could be awkward. Better to err on the generous side. Now what you get them is obviously up to you, but here is what you should not give anyone this holiday season.",
      "Don't give them food. You are giving someone a gift, not arriving at a potluck. \u00a0I understand cookies, candy and fruit may seem like a thoughtful, delicious idea, but nobody wants anything perishable.",
      "Instead of food, a great gift would be alcohol. \u00a0Booze never goes bad, and based on the world we live in today, everyone needs it. It's not even noon, and just thinking about some of the conversations I'll be having this December makes me want a drink.",
      "Another thing nobody wants is clothing. Unless you are a personal shopper, you are not qualified to buy clothing for someone else.\u00a0 I don't care if there is a gift receipt. That's just like giving someone an errand.",
      "Instead of clothing, a great gift would be \u2026 alcohol! Now you may think, \"But Jim, what if they don't want alcohol?\" That's fine. Then they'll regift it. No gift receipt necessary!",
      "Here's another no: Don't give gift cards. They're unimaginative and lazy. The gift card is just going to be lost. In five years when the gift card is finally found, it will be expired and just provide stress and guilt. Instead, a great gift would be \u2026 alcohol! The alcohol can be used to numb the pain from misplacing all those gift cards.",
      "You may think, \"But Jim, alcohol is never the answer.\"\u00a0 Well, sometimes alcohol gets pretty close!",
      "Finally, don't give someone socks this holiday season.\u00a0 Yes, socks are practical but wildly impersonal.\u00a0 You may think, \"But Jim, socks will keep them warm during the winter.\" If you really want to keep someone warm this winter, a great gift would be \u2026",
      "You thought I was going to say alcohol, didn't you?",
      "Well, I am! Because alcohol could warm your heart during a winter which we all know is going to be filled with a lot of awkwardness.",
      "You may also think, \"But Jim, alcohol is poison!\"\u00a0 Yes, it is, and like most parents of teenagers I'm going to need some of that poison.",

    "title": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on the strength of a diverse military",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:51:37 -0500",
    "summary": "The nation's first African American Secretary of Defense talks about the responsibilities of the job, and the importance of a diverse fighting force.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this month, Lloyd Austin, the nation's first African American secretary of defense, returned to West Point, the institution that forever changed his life. \"When I first came to West Point,\" he told the corps of cadets, \"I had never been north of Georgia.\"",
      "He spoke to the nation's next generation of Army officers about what it means to lead in combat: \"Artillery was exploding all around us. The troops in the TOC [Tactical Operations Center] were watching me intently, waiting to hear what I had to say. And at that moment, I realized that they would follow me through fire if they trusted that I knew the way forward.\"",
      "When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, Austin was giving the orders for the lead Army division. \"I was calling the shots in terms of where brigades were moving, and so I needed to be right up at the front of the formation,\" he said.",
      "He ordered what became known as the \"Thunder Run\" into the heart of Baghdad. He would return to Iraq for two more tours. That's how he met then-Vice President Joe Biden, who was the Obama administration's point man for Iraq. \"I would be with him as he visited our troops, but he'd also ask for my thoughts, my opinion,\" Austin said.",
      "I asked, \"When Joe Biden was elected president, did you expect to become secretary of defense?\"",
      "\"I did not,\" Austin replied. \"And matter of fact, that was the furthest thing from my mind.\"",
      "But he admits he loves his job.",
      "That job consists of non-stop closed-door meetings with senior officials, both in the Pentagon and around the world by teleconference. At one such meeting focused on Ukraine, Austin said, \"It's been very helpful in terms of making sure that everyone is kind of rowing in the same direction.\"",
      "There is also constant travel, circling the globe visiting allies and troops.",
      "Despite his high-profile job, he is a reluctant public figure. \"It's my personality,\" he said. \"I don't make excuses for that. But I don't think being a private person is necessarily a bad thing.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think it had anything to do with being a Black officer in a white-dominated institution?\"",
      "\"It does,\" he said.",
      "It got him in trouble when he tried to keep his prostate cancer secret even from the president. At a February 1, 2024 press conference, Austin said, \"I should have informed my boss; I did not. That was a mistake.\"",
      "This private person nonetheless had to stand up in the Pentagon's briefing room and talk for an hour about his prostate. He says he is now cancer-free. \"I thank God for that,\" he said.",
      "His knees have seen a few too many parachute jumps. But back at West Point nearly 50 years after he graduated, he seemed to be basking in the limelight, although he was sharing it with the Army football team having one of its best seasons ever.",
      "At West Point, football is not just a sport; it's preparation for battle. \"They're just tough and rugged and play together, and that's what we gotta be,\" said coach Jeff Monken, who has turned Army football around. \"It's gotta be teamwork. That's the lesson they take from this place into the Army.\"",
      "\"That's how you're going to fight,\" said Austin. \"You're not going to win a war by yourself.\"",
      "Army was undefeated until they ran into Notre Dame, and lost by five touchdowns. Ironically, Notre Dame had been Austin's first choice to attend: \"I'd applied there first, got accepted, got a scholarship, and then I got accepted at West Point,\" he recalled. \"My father brought me in and said, 'Hey, you go to Notre Dame, it's still gonna cost me money. If you go to this school, it's a great education, and they pay you to go there!'\"",
      "\"His logic persuaded you,\" said Monken.",
      "In high school, Austin's nickname was \"Blade,\" courtesy of his school's football coach. \"I was a very thin, kind of wiry young man,\" Austin recalled. \"I said, 'Coach, put me in,' and he said, 'Son, they're going to mow you down like a blade of grass.'\"",
      "Austin ended up as captain of his high school basketball team in Georgia. He was also one of the people that helped to integrate his school. \"I was one of the first students there,\" he said, describing the experience as tough.",
      "Over and over, Austin has broken through as the first African American, and has said that he was in situations where he \"can't\" fail. \"I've been in that 'can't fail' position a lot,\" he said. \"The first African American to be the vice chief of the Army; the first African American to command a division in combat; the first African American to command an entire theater of war.\"",
      "He is Exhibit A for anyone who believes the military is a true meritocracy, where you are judged by what you do, not what you look like. But he has been depicted by right-wing firebrands as the leader of a \"woke\" military which promotes minorities at the expense of war fighting.",
      "In an April 5, 2022 exchange on Capitol Hill, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, Republican from Florida, made accusations to Austin about leaders being \"woke\":",
      "Gaetz: \"So while everyone else in the world seems to be developing capabilities and being more strategic, we got time to embrace 'critical race theory' at West Point.\"Austin: \"The fact that you're embarrassed by your country, by your military? I'm sorry for that.\"Gaetz: \"No, no, no. I'm embarrassed by your leadership. I am not embarrassed for my country. The Biden administration is trying to destroy our military by force-feeding it 'woke-ism.'\"",
      "I asked Austin, \"Why is it that that presses your button and all the other criticism just rolls off?\"",
      "\"I've fought alongside these troops,\" he replied. \"This is a lethal, professional war-fighting machine.\"",
      "A machine Austin drove to Baghdad with battlefield daring that critics say has been lost as America became mired in never-ending wars, culminating in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Appearing on Fox News in June, Pete Gegseth, Donald Trump's pick to be the next secretary of defense, said, \"Ramming stuff into the Pentagon that has nothing you do with winning wars \u2013 what is your gender? What is your race? \u2026 The Pentagon likes to say our diversity is our strength. What a bunch of garbage!\"",
      "But Austin said he absolutely disagrees with criticism that the drive to include women in all the combat arms has led to a weaker military. \"You know, I've seen women in combat. I don't have to guess at this,\" he said.",
      "Women were part of his command team during the Iraqi invasion. \"I said, 'If any of you feel that you don't want to be there at the front of the fight, say so now and I won't think any less of you.' One of the women piped up and said, 'Sir, what are you talking about?' And what they were telling me was, 'Quit talking.\u00a0 Let's get to the fight.'\"",
      "One woman eager to get to the fight is First Captain Caroline Robinson, the top cadet in West Point's Class of 2025. Fifty years ago, when Austin graduated, there were no women here. \"And I think because of that, we probably missed a pretty significant part of the population,\" he said.",
      "As the top cadet, Robinson can have her pick of any branch in the Army. \"So right now, field artillery is my number one branch choice,\" she said.",
      "On December 4, \"Branch Night,\" the cadets of 2025 \u2013 one-quarter of them women, and 10 percent African American \u2013 found out where they will serve, when they opened envelopes containing their branch assignments.",
      "Fifty years ago, there was no such thing as a female artillery officer, or a Black secretary of defense. In response to critics who rail against diversity in the armed forces, Austin told the cadets, \"Any military that turns away tough, talented patriots, women or men, is just making itself weaker and smaller. So, enough already!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:19:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Go inside the New York prison theater program (inspiration for the acclaimed film \"Sing Sing\") that is credited with dramatically reducing the recidivism rates of inmates who engaged in the performing and visual arts.",
    "story": [
      "Sing Sing Correctional Facility is 40 miles and a world away from New York City. For almost 200 years, a grim monument to the theory that harsh discipline discourages former inmates from returning to a life of crime.",
      "It's a flawed theory. A national study by the Department of Justice found that 60% of former inmates are back behind bars within three years.",
      "Which is what gives the movie \"Sing Sing\" such resonance.",
      "Before he got a taste for acting, Clarence Maclin, who came to be known as Divine Eye, was a violent, knife-wielding, drug dealing inmate at Sing Sing. Now he's appearing as a version of himself in the critically-acclaimed movie about a prison theater program. The movie stars Hollywood veteran Colman Domingo. in fact, 85% of the cast members in the film are what's referred to these days as formerly incarcerated.",
      "\"I'm lovin' the movie,\" said Maclin. \"I'm lovin' the reaction, the acceptance, the way that people get it.\"",
      "\"Well, it's gotta be a big change for you,\" I said. \"You were always the outlaw, and now you're the star.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's a big change. It's a beautiful thing.\"",
      "On a recent evening in November, we visited Sing Sing prison with Maclin and John Whitfield, the man he credits for his transformation. Whitfield, known as Divine G, was an award-winning author in prison and a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program. Maclin said, \"I'd probably still be in and out of prison, never would've changed my life, had it not been for this brother and his tenacity about getting me into the program.\"",
      "According to Whitfield, getting Maclin into the RTA program (that is, Rehabilitation Through the Arts) took some doing: \"But he eventually came around. And he came around and he experimented, and the minute he got on that stage and got bitten by the bug, I couldn't shut him up!\"",
      "The two Divines, both out of Sing Sing for a dozen years now, returned as guests to meet with members of the current RTA class and a couple of civilian volunteers.",
      "Perhaps nowhere in the world are the actual Divines better known and more widely admired than here.",
      "The actors stood in a circle for a warmup exercise, and the Divines jumped right in. \"It's definitely about communication, about keeping eye contact,\" Maclin said. \"And we use that particular exercise so that when we're on stage, we try not to step over everybody's lines, so you gotta pay attention.\"",
      "The chant \"chicken ... fried ... rice,\" picked up by each of the participants ricocheted around the circle, faster and faster, until they break up in laughter. One man offered, \"It helps you remember where you came from, 'cause all we had was chicken fried rice!\"",
      "The laughter may be especially jarring to the victims of their crimes, or to the families of those victims.\u00a0 What (to put it more bluntly) does society get out of these RTA programs?",
      "Here's one answer: The staggering number of former inmates back in prison three years or less after their release \u2013 that 60% recidivism rate \u2013 is just 3% for those who stayed with the Rehabilitation Through the Arts program.",
      "Divine G was involved with RTA back when success was still very much in question: \"Some people's looking at us like we had four heads. Are you crazy? Going on stage? Talking about 'To be or not to be'? We didn't force feed it that fast. You know we had to do it incrementally.\"",
      "None of it would have been possible without volunteers from the outside. Almost 20 years ago, Brent Buell volunteered long days at Sing Sing to direct the play that's at the heart of the film. \"Little by little, that getting into the character, [that] first step in empathy, and I'd see the guys eventually saying to one another, 'What do you think your character feels?'\"",
      "Buell recalls what his actors wanted to play: \"The guys said they wanted to do something with Robin Hood. They wanted something with Egyptians. They wanted something with the Old West. They wanted something with Freddy Krueger. They wanted something with gladiators.\"",
      "They wanted a comedy that didn't exist. So, Buell wrote it for them over one long weekend, and called it \"Breakin' the Mummy's Code.\"",
      "Buell recalls one particular breakthrough moment: \"In the play, it takes place in the black plague, and the men have been dying. And Alotin Common, the Egyptian priest, says the bodies began to rot. And one of the men inadvertently let out a very \u2026 loud sound.\"",
      "In other words, he farted. \"And the guys started to laugh. Well, then everybody was making, you know rotting noises and things. And they all had permission to be funny. And that was really a turning point in how the whole cast began to see that this is a comedy, and we can really have fun.\"",
      "I said, \"Somehow, I don't think this is going to convince America that we have a solution to our penal problems.\"",
      "\"What'll convince them is when they meet and are able to talk to the men, that developing of the trust, the respect, the empathy \u2013 those men are different people than they were,\" Buell said.",
      "He taped the original production, so that the men could share it with their families.",
      "This was back in 2005, and Brian Fischer, who was Sing Sing's superintendent back then, recalls that some of his staff were a little skeptical: \"All those guys up there carrying on? But as time goes by, the staff accepts them. And more importantly, the other offenders in the prison accept them. They become leaders. They become people that other people want to follow. And it changes the atmosphere and reduces the tension in a prison.\"",
      "Now retired, Fischer went on to become New York State's Commissioner of Prisons. \"I think over time, the fact that we were able to put it in other prisons, the fact that it was now acceptable \u2013 theater, arts, music [are] now acceptable in prisons that up 'til now didn't want it.\"",
      "Prison life doesn't normally encourage displays of emotion. RTA made that permissable. Demetrius Sampson told us, \"I've been gone so long that I forgot what freedom felt like. But when I come to RTA, I felt free again. I left all the regrets and anxiety and mess-ups at the door. And I was able to come in and portray a character with freed-man problems.\"",
      "Tim Walker, a lifer, cites the role he played as Macbeth 13 years ago as a life-changing experience. \"'Come fate and champion me unto the utterance.' That's Macbeth. That's the impact that RTA has had on me. That was the first time I ever touched a stage \u2013 someone convicted of murder, multiple felonies. I changed my life.\"",
      "Michael said, \"The public sees us as the problem, and the RTA sees us as the solution.\"",
      "Clarence Maclin said, \"I came here as an inspiration, to be inspiring to you, and I got inspired by you. Your humanity is monumental. You boys are giants in here.\"",
      "Nothing more or less than the promise that they can be something other than they were.",

      "Unfortunately, their newly wedded bliss would be short-lived. Eight months after the wedding, Rod's younger brother Kevin, who wished the couple \"endless years of love, health and happiness,\" at their wedding, lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 19.",
      "Kathy Metzer: It really hit Rod hard. I mean, it \u2014 I don't think he was ever the same after that. \u2026 He depended on Morgan at that point, more than he did anybody. I don't think he left her side for more than an hour or two.",
      "But the next year would bring some good news to celebrate.",
      "Morgan Metzer: We got pregnant with our son.",
      "Morgan says picking his name was easy.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Kevin always wanted to be an uncle. He always talked about it, how much fun he would have.",
      "Kathy Metzer: They named him Kevin after my Kevin, Rod's brother. (cries)",
      "But the family would suffer a second, and devastating, loss. Baby Kevin was born early, with a congenital heart defect. He lived just 18 days.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He actually died on his due date.",
      "Nikki Battiste: The loss of a child is unthinkable and I would imagine tough for you and Rod.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Very tough. \u2026 Don't really remember a lot of it. It's a big blur with all the emotions.",
      "So it seemed like a miracle when, just three months later, Morgan discovered she was pregnant again. Kathy remembers the moment Rod showed her the ultrasound picture.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He says, \"what do you see?\" I said, \"a baby.\" He said, \"No. Look, what do you see?\" And I just screamed at the top of my lungs, \"two babies,\" you know. (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Twins.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Twins. They were gonna have twins.",
      "Morgan gave birth to a healthy boy and girl in 2012. It should have been a happy time but not long after, the marriage began to change.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Probably about a year after they were born, which is right around the time that Rod lost his job, is when it started going down south from there.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did Rod do for work?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He, he had so many jobs. His main one, when he lost all of his money, was he was being a day trader for himself.",
      "Rod's job loss happened to come at the same time Morgan's career was starting to flourish.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I started my own interior design business and it took off. \u2026 I just didn't expect it to boom and blow up.",
      "Morgan's company, Shiplap and Sugar, became so successful she asked Stabasefski to join her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: She was saying, you know, like \"I need help, I'm overwhelmed.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you became business partners?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: Yeah. \u2026 Making money. \u2026 Working our tails off, doing what we love.",
      "Morgan says her professional success, and Rod's lack of it, made for a dangerous combination. She says he began to abuse her \u2014 both physically and mentally. She recalls one Labor Day weekend. She and Rod were celebrating on a boat with friends and had just returned to their cabin.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I guess we had gotten into an argument about something, \u2026 that's the first night he beat the \u2014 he beat me.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you think, he hit me. I've gotta get out of here?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. I had my dad come and get me.",
      "Shockingly, Morgan says Rod tried to convince her, and the people closest to her, that she was to blame for her injuries.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He convinced my parents that I was the one that did it.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You were just out of control. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn't keep your temper. You were just whaling all over the place.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod claimed she got hurt because he was forced to physically restrain her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I'm like, OK, well, maybe that's my fault. \u2026 And my friends stopped talking to me then because he had no marks on him. It was all me.",
      "Morgan says that's when a new phase in the marriage began, one in which she started to doubt her own reality because, she says, Rod was gaslighting her \u2014 making her think every conflict Rod instigated actually began with her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I think she thought she was crazy. You know, you get programmed to think that you're crazy, like it's all in your head.",
      "Morgan says Rod even involved their children in his deception.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He pretended I pushed him down the stairs and he literally rolled down the stairs. You know, he actually got hurt and said to the kids, \"Look, Mommy pushed me downstairs. Can you believe that?\"",
      "Morgan says Rod sexually abused her as well, although she says it took a while for her to recognize what it was.",
      "Morgan Metzer: A lot of times he's very aggressive and wouldn't take the word no. And so now looking back on it, I guess he did sexually abuse me.",
      "Morgan filed for divorce in 2020.",
      "Nikki Battiste: When Morgan decided to \u2026 go through with the divorce, how was she handling it?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: You know, it was the first time I think I saw her have peace.",
      "The divorce was final in December and Morgan was ready to move on. But now, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, it appeared Rod had come back into her life as her hero.",
      "CRITICAL CLUES IN THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Sergeant Lyvers and Sergeant Robert Haugh recall that when they first arrived at Morgan's house at 3 a.m. Rod's behavior had struck them as unusual.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: So, as we were walking up \u2026 Rodney was, um, seated in his car right here \u2026 with another deputy.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he say anything?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah, he did. \u2026 He asked, \"Hey man, are you the guy that we've been waiting on? And I said, \"uh, yes, sir, I am.\" And then he replied, \"do your f****** job.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I was taken aback. I really was.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: This guy just had found his wife bound, um, and beaten on the back porch. And you would think that my arrival to help find a resolution to this, uh, would be welcoming.",
      "Immediately, Morgan's appearance startled the investigators.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Her eye was swollen shut, black and blue. \u2026 She still had the, uh, zip tie around her one wrist. And I was shocked, and I had seen a lot in my career. And, uh, I was surprised that somebody would \u2014 would be so harsh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did it make you think?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Somebody was mad.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Absolutely. It was an emotional attack.",
      "Morgan was not only physically injured; investigators could tell she had suffered psychologically after the attacker left her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: She was in fear that she was \u2014 someone was still back here watching her and that they were gonna kill her if she moved. And so she laid here and waited.",
      "Morgan was outside for 40 minutes before Rod arrived, but initially she thought it was just half that.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Morgan believed it to be somewhere around 15 to 20 minutes, max. Um, that was her perception of time.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Interesting. I would've thought the opposite, that would've felt longer for her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I agree. \u2026 When their adrenaline's going, you know, people perceive things differently.",
      "The first thing Lyvers and Haugh did was separate Morgan, Rod and Morgan's father and brother \u2014 who came over after she called them. Then Lyvers recorded his conversation with Morgan inside the house.",
      "Safely out of earshot of her ex-husband, who was standing just outside, Morgan told investigators that she suspected her attacker was the man pretending to be her hero.",
      "MORGAN METZER: I just thought it was him.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: When you say \"him,\" you're talking about your ex-husband?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "Morgan said she had no idea who her assailant was when the attack began, but then came one critical moment.",
      "Morgan Metzer: When he said \u2026 \"you're going to miss your husband,\" I said, \"no, don't hurt my husband. I love him very much.\" And I don't know what made me do that. But at that exact moment is when \u2026 the mood of the room changed. I knew I was going to live.",
      "And then there was another, even bigger clue, when her attacker lifted Morgan off the bed to place her outside.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's when I really knew it was him.",
      "Morgan remembered something from years earlier.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was pregnant with my kids, my twins. And sometimes you have to get help out of the bed. \u2026 The way he gently held me and got me out of bed, it was so familiar that I was like, this is him. I know it's 100% percent him.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't going to let him know that I knew it was him. Because if he did then he \u2014 I didn't know what he was going to do.",
      "She told them the attack had followed a chaotic week which began with very troubling news.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He thinks he's got pancreatic cancer.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He just called me \u2026 \u00a0and said, \"I've got pancreatic cancer.\" And so I rushed to go see him. \u2026 I said, \"you're the father of my children. \u2026 I'm here for you.\"",
      "Morgan Metzer: He showed me doctor's notes and whatnot.",
      "Rod had told no one else and Morgan explained that she'd been letting him stay at her house.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He'd been sleeping on my sofa because he had been really freaked out and upset obviously.",
      "Morgan told the investigators that Rod had spent the week trying to reconcile with her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He kept begging me to get back together with me. \u2026 Just constantly haggling me.",
      "But Morgan says she had no interest. By the morning of Dec. 31, she'd had enough. Feeling the pressure of being his sole emotional support, Morgan insisted Rod share his health news with his parents.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"no, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.\" And that's when I was like, \"OK, get out.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod spent the day texting her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You need to get back with me. I'll make enough money. You can quit your job right now.\"",
      "Fed up with it all, Morgan lied and told Rod she'd be sleeping elsewhere that New Year's Eve night.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Staying at my parents' house tonight. I'm turning my phone off.\" Like, give me some space.",
      "As Morgan shared her suspicions with investigators, she didn't know if they would accept what she was telling them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I've been mentally, emotionally, physically abused.",
      "Because Rod made her feel like she was to blame for years.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's what he's built in my brain.",
      "But that all changed when Lyvers told her he believed her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I just melted. \u2026 He heard me. I have not been heard in years. Nobody listened. Nobody heard me and he heard me.",
      "Rachel Ashe: That started the investigation into Rodney Metzer.",
      "Rachel Ashe is the Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney for Cherokee County. She works exclusively on domestic violence cases. Parker, an emotional support dog, is often with her to comfort victims. Ashe says investigators were perplexed that Rod had come to Morgan's house that night after she'd told him she'd be at her parents' home.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Why did you even come here? Why didn't you go to her parents' house? Why didn't \u2014 why didn't you check with her parents?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He claimed it was just habit, normal.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"It's what I would do.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you scratching your heads?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: A little bit.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: We questioned him on it.",
      "Rod said that after hearing that knocking on his window, and someone saying Morgan's name, he tried phoning Morgan to warn her. Haugh wanted to check.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think that's what prompted, \"hey, where's your phone?\"",
      "Rod handed his cellphone to the investigators.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Gave them permission to look through his phone.",
      "And what they found came as a surprise.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was an Apple iPhone, and it had a hidden folder. \u2026 And in the hidden folder were images of Morgan \u2014 um, partially dressed.",
      "Rachel Ashe: A lot of photos of Morgan nude and those photos of Morgan nude, it was pretty apparent that she didn't know he was taking those photos of her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was quite alarmed.",
      "Investigators also discovered Rod had snapped pictures of Morgan's cellphone showing text messages between her and another man. They considered these and the photos of Morgan to be an invasion of privacy.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: You didn't have that permission. Y'all don't have that relationship. She's f****** baffled that you have that. That's stalkerish.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We knew we had to \u2026 get him in custody \u2026 while we started doing search warrants and started investigating \u2026 to prevent him from destroying evidence.",
      "ROD METZER: People make mistakes, man.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I think you made a lot of mistakes.",
      "SGT. ROBERT HAUGH: Big, big mistakes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you arrested him for having taken those photos secretly?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Stand up.",
      "ROD METZER: You're kidding me?",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Nope, we're not kidding you. Stand up. This is not a joke. C'mon.",
      "But could investigators prove that Rod had attacked Morgan that night?",
      "ZIP TIES AND ALARMING INTERNET SEARCHES",
      "Morgan Metzer: Watched him get, uh, arrested, walk to the car, and be put in. It was kind of like, is this really happening?",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was any part of you sad?",
      "Morgan Metzer: No, not at the time. It was angry and just sore.",
      "Even as they booked Rod for taking those pictures of Morgan and her texts, Haugh and Lyvers had already developed a theory about why Rod might have attacked her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I believe, he thought he was going to come in and \u2014 and rescue her and be the savior and, uh \u2014 and win her back.",
      "Investigators hoped home security cameras would support their theory. But they quickly learned that all the video from the time of the attack had been erased through the app on Morgan's phone that the assailant had used to unlock her back porch door when he left. Morgan's attacker took her phone with him. It was never recovered.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you ever able to retrieve those missing videos from the security company?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: No. \u2026 Once videos are deleted, they're deleted from their cloud.",
      "But since Morgan had a home security system, how did the attacker get in without setting off the alarm? It did not take long to figure out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: This is the window the attacker entered?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct. Right here is the, uh \u2014 the window that we found the screen was actually removed.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That basement window \u2026 had an alarm sensor that was removed from the window and put together on the windowsill. So, if the window was to open, it would appear, you know, to the alarm system that the sensor is still making contact.",
      "Investigators believed Rod had disabled the sensor while he was staying at Morgan's house that week.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night.",
      "Although the home security videos had been erased, there was other video from prior to the attack. The camera on Morgan's front porch caught Rod earlier that evening.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He had sent me a picture of a check\u2026. And he's like, \"it's underneath your front porch.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was for $56,000 and change.",
      "Morgan says the message Rod sent with the picture of the check made it seem like he was trying to make a grand gesture.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You should have all the money. You deserve everything,\" pretty much in a nutshell.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think it was to get her to come back to the house that evening because \u2026 she told Rodney she was gonna be at her parents' house for New Year's.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Morgan returned to the house, retrieved it, and kind of made some sort of a \u2014 uh \u2014 of a gesture and she walked back into the house and put it on the kitchen countertop.",
      "Morgan's attacker took that check with him. It was never found.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you find out about Rod's finances?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:: That check would've bounced.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yeah, he was broke.",
      "The day after his arrest, investigators executed search warrants on Rod's car and his apartment. As soon as they walked through the door, they found a key piece of evidence.",
      "Rachel Ashe: They located this bag of zip ties in his apartment. And \u2026 a portion of a zip tie.",
      "Before arriving at her house, Morgan's attacker had pre-looped the zip ties he'd put on her wrists.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was working in the dark. He was handcuffing somebody. You never know how much fight that person's going to put up.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: One of the zip ties actually, um, was pretty unique because it had two, um \u2014 other zip ties that had been, uh, ratcheted onto it and then cut. And so basically what we were looking at was a \u2014 a zip tie that had two extra heads.",
      "Haugh and Lyvers needed to find out if that portion of a zip tie, essentially a tail, found in Rod's apartment, lined up with one of the extra heads on Morgan's restraints. They headed to their crime lab.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So these are the zip ties that were actually found on Morgan?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yes, they are.",
      "Melanie Thrasher is a crime scene technician.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was able to match the \u2014 this tail to one of the heads on the zip tie for Morgan's wrist.",
      "The striations on the tail found in Rod's apartment lined up exactly with those on Morgan's zip tie. A \"perfect match\" said Haugh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think when you saw this?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That we were going to be adding charges to his, uh, existing booking. \u2026 And we had our guy. \u2026 I would've never, you know, imagined, uh, having a piece of evidence like this.",
      "But the search warrant of Rod's apartment yielded even more. There was a book \u2014",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \"7 Ways to \u2014",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"To Be Her Hero.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \u2014 \"Be Her Hero,\" to \u2014 to win somebody back.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That gave us the motive. \u2026 It added to that motive.",
      "Investigators examined Rod's browser history.",
      "Rachel Ashe:\u00a0 The searches \u2026 were very disturbing.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He was researching \"how to change your voice.\"",
      "Rachel Ashe: \"How long to choke somebody unconscious.\"",
      "The searches also included \"How to crack an iPhone password,\" \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and one that was especially appalling.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He Google searched \u2026 \"cancer diagnosis letters.\"",
      "Investigators searched Rod's outgoing emails. There they found Rod had set up a fake email account to create the pancreatic cancer diagnosis letter he'd shown Morgan. And there was more.",
      "Rachel Ashe: He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. \u2026 All of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He wasn't sick at all?",
      "Rachel Ashe: No. \u2026 He did not have cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you think that he faked the cancer diagnosis as a way to try to get you back or as a way to get access to your house 'cause he had this plan?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I think it was to get me back. It might have been both.",
      "On Jan. 3, two days after the attack, Lyvers and Sergeant Tom Harris interviewed Rod. They talked to him about his health.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You said you're diabetic",
      "ROD METZER: Yes.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What other kind of health issues do you have?",
      "ROD METZER: Nothing as far as I know of yet.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I thought you had cancer.",
      "Lyvers confronted Rod about the cancer diagnosis he'd faked to Morgan.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: How did you tell her that \u2026 this \u2014 this cancer thing?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know if I should talk to you guys anymore. I'm starting to get a really bad feeling. What angle you guys are coming from.",
      "Then Rod tried to turn the tables \u2014 by attempting to take the upper hand in the interview.",
      "ROD METZER: I've already learned something about you, that your facial expressions.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Tell me.",
      "ROD METZER: And you keep scratching yourself, and you get agitated by what I say.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I'm a 100% not agitated.",
      "ROD METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "The investigators also questioned Rod about his internet searches.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Has there been a time recently where you were interested in how you can change the sound of your voice?",
      "ROD METZER: Maybe.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Tell me about that.",
      "ROD METZER: I felt like I wasn't \u2014 my voice wasn't manly enough.",
      "Then Harris lowered the boom.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: The, uh, most significant thing that we found in your apartment was a collection of zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: Zip ties?",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Black zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: I don't have zip ties.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I know you don't. We have 'em now.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: These are identical to the ones that were, uh, binding Morgan's wrists.",
      "ROD METZER: This is just starting to get squirrelly.",
      "Harris told Rod about that zip tie tail they'd recovered.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: We compared that microscopically to the zip ties that were on Morgan's wrists when the deputies found her. And wouldn't you know it? It is a perfect cut.",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Did somebody break in and put 'em there?",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Like what?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What do you think's going on?",
      "ROD METZER: I didn't have some big-ass f****** zip ties in my apartment.",
      "But new evidence was about to say otherwise.",
      "ROD METZER PLEADS GUILTY",
      "Hours after the interview with Rod Metzer concluded, he was charged with 10 counts related to the attack on Morgan Metzer \u2014 including home invasion, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual battery.",
      "MORGAN METZER: As soon as I felt that gun right here in my head, I was like \u2014",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: So, you thought \u2014",
      "MORGAN METZER: \"All right, Jesus, I'm coming.\"",
      "The next day Morgan, with her friend Nichole by her side, talked to investigators again.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You thought you were gonna die?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yep. I thought I was dead. But then also part of me was like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let myself die. \u2026 I have gotta fight for my kids.",
      "Harris told Morgan they'd watched the home security video of Rod arriving at her house after her attack. He rang the front doorbell but when there was no response, headed around to the back.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I thought it was kind of interesting that he called out your name as he's walking around the side of your house.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yes. \u2026 Like, why would you think I was outside.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was your reaction when you learned Rod had been arrested for violently attacking Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, that \u2014 that absolutely threw me under the ground. \u2026 There had to be a mistake. Rod wasn't capable of that.",
      "Two days after Rod was charged he talked to his mom Kathy on the phone.",
      "ROD METZER (jail phone call): Why is she doing this to me? She knows it wasn't me.",
      "But the evidence kept mounting. When investigators recovered those zip ties from Rod's apartment, the bag they came in was found as well.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I brought up a \u2014 a, uh, my Lowe's app on my phone and scanned the UPC code and the UPC code came back that they were in fact sold at Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: The sheriff's office then went to the two Lowe's that we have here in Cherokee County. \u2026 And they started searching for transactions.",
      "It didn't take long. Rod Metzer had purchased those zip ties on Dec. 30 \u2014 about 36 hours before the attack; easy to find because he paid with his debit card. Investigators obtained the security video from Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This was during COVID and this was during a period where everybody was wearing a mask, except for Rodney Metzer. So the surveillance images and the videos that were recovered from Lowe's of him purchasing those zip ties \u2026 his face is right there in the camera.",

      "Just four minutes later, Rod is caught on camera again, leaving the building, wearing completely different clothes and sneakers, and carrying a plastic bag. The time stamp was 1:24 a.m.",

      "Rachel Ashe: We just don't know where that went.",
      "Investigators can't know for sure what was in that bag but believe it had evidence Rod discarded on his drive back to Morgan's house. The attacker's mask was never found. But Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney Rachel Ashe says they had more than enough to prove Rod was guilty.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This is a prosecutor's dream to put up because the evidence in this case was overwhelming, overwhelming.",
      "But Ashe says she wanted to offer Morgan an opportunity for quicker closure than a trial would bring in the form of a plea deal for Rod.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We went through the pros and cons of letting him plead guilty, letting him accept responsibility. \u2026 We agreed, um, we should try. He took it quickly.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2021, Rod pleaded guilty to a total of 14 counts related to Morgan's attack and the photos found on his phone.",

      "Morgan Metzer (reading her victim impact statement): Rod, not only will this statement be to my attacker, but it'll also be my last words to whom I thought was the love of my life. \u2026 The last four years being married to you was like living with a monster that constantly tried to break me down and fence me in. \u2026 It was a blessing in disguise. \u2026 I can now walk with the confidence knowing the pain you have given me is turned into power.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I walked off that stand with a thousand pounds off of my shoulders. It felt so good. It felt empowering. And I got the last word.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How was it to listen to your best friend read this incredibly powerful statement?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: It was awesome because she did not cry. \u2026 Her voice did not shake \u2026 and she said everything she needed to say, and when she was done, she was done.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 20:40:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands.",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands, the island's top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday.",
      "France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction.",
      "\"I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we'll get close to a thousand. Even thousands ... given the violence of this event,\" Mayotte Prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere.",
      "He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years.",
      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte, in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, is France's poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \"this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\" he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone's path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \"thoughts\" were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \"will be high,\" while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \"help the population and prevent potential looting.\"",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\"Mayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\" he said.",
      "Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding.",
      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

    "summary": "The Syrian government has been under strict sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years.",
    "story": [
      "A U.N. envoy on Sunday called for a quick end to Western sanctions against Syria as the country's new leaders and regional and global powers begin to chart a path forward following the fall of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The Syrian government has been under strict sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad's brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and later spiraled into a civil war.",
      "The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and broke his iron grip on the country just days ago faces a nation wracked and deeply isolated by tough international sanctions, which compounded Syria's previous economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate Syria's rebuilding: the new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive is saddled with a terrorist designation by the U.S.",
      "The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that setting Syria back on track after the past few tumultuous weeks will be helped by a speedy relief of sanctions.",
      "\"We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around building of Syria,\" he said.",
      "Parts of Syria's biggest cities remain damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding of damaged infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution.",
      "Pedersen traveled to Damascus to meet with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that officials have been in direct contact with the group.",
      "Over the weekend, Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan where he said he secured the backing of the 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after decades of Assad family rule.",
      "They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need, and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Blinken has promised that the United States would recognize and support a new government that met those principles.",
      "A readout from President Biden's virtual call with the G7 leaders said they discussed \"the need for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition process\" amid other issues in the Middle East.",
      "With the clock on the Biden administration running out, it isn't clear what approach President-elect Donald Trump will take on Syria.",
      "Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not yet made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it.",
      "\"We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,\" Pedersen said. \"That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.\"",
      "He called for \"justice and accountability for crimes\" committed during the war and for the international community to step up humanitarian aid.",
      "In a sign of Syrians' yearning for a return to normalcy, even after the whirlwind rebel offensive of the past weeks, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital.",
      "At Nahla Zaidan school in the capital's Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government's two-starred Syrian flag.",
      "\"Syria is trying to build up this country with these children who came. Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,\" said Maysoun Al-Ali, director of the school.",
      "\"God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.\"",

      "South Korea's parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon's fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country's resilient democracy.",
      "The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon's presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.",
      "It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon's impeachment after ruling party lawmakers\u00a0boycotted the first floor vote last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon's impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, told reporters Sunday that a swift ruling is the only way to minimize national chaos. Lee also said that the Democratic Party would not seek to impeach of Han, despite some calls to do so over his alleged inaction to prevent Yoon's martial law enforcement. Lee said there was no need to introduce further political uncertainty.",
      "Lee also proposed the creation of a national council where the government and the National Assembly would work together to stabilize state affairs. He said bipartisan cooperation is essential to navigating the political paralysis that has halted high-level diplomacy and spooked financial markets since Yoon's martial law decree.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon's impeachment was an outcome driven by \"the people's ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.\"",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful\u00a0K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, \"We have preserved the constitutional order!\"",
      "\"The impeachment has been done in line with the people's demand and I hope a decision to dismiss Yoon Suk Yeol will come as soon as possible,\" said Kim Su-bong, a protester. \"I'm very happy and moved. I view it as a victory of the people.\"",
      "In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.",
      "The acting leader bolsters the country's security posture",
      "Yoon issued a statement saying he would \"never give up\" and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a \"temporary\" pause of his presidency.",
      "\"I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,\" Yoon said.",
      "Yoon's Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.",
      "Han, the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea's major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han's office.",

I ask you to carry out your duties without any neglect to ensure that the government is operated without being shaken,\" Han said in a televised statement.",
      "South Korea's executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade minister and finance minister. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.",

      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon's decree. No major violence occurred.",

They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament's operations even under martial law.",
      "The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon \"committed rebellion that hurt peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.\" It said Yoon's mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.",
      "Yoon remains defiant",
      "In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon rejected the rebellion charges, calling his martial law introduction an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach many top officials and undermine the government's budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.",
      "Lee called Yoon's speech a \"mad declaration of war\" against his own people.",
      "Observers say Yoon's speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon's approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.",
      "Some of Yoon's claims don't align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.",

      "Speaking at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period.",
      "\"Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\" Blinken said. He added that \"our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we're prepared to help them do so.\"",
      "Blinken also said that officials are \"also communicating directly with those in positions of authority in Syria.\"",
      "HTS, which was once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department since 2018. That designation carries with it severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any \"material support\" to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups.",
      "In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group's leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus, the capital, are in touch with Western embassies.",
      "HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad's fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past.",

    "story": [
      "Isak Andic, the founder of Spanish clothing retailer Mango, one of Europe's largest fashion groups with nearly 2,800 stores worldwide, died Saturday in an accident, the company said.",
      "\"It is with deep regret that we announce the unexpected death of Isak Andic, our non-executive chairman and founder of Mango,\" the Barcelona-based company's CEO, Toni Ruiz, said in a statement.",
      "\"Isak has been an example for all of us. He dedicated his life to Mango, leaving an indelible mark thanks to his strategic vision, his inspiring leadership and his unwavering commitment to values that he himself imbued in our company,\" he added.",
      "The company did not provide further details about the accident. Spanish media said the 71-year-old died after falling while hiking with several members of his family near Barcelona.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a post on social media, \"My condolences to the family of Isak Andic, founder of Mango, on his tragic death in an accident in the Salnitre de Collbat\u00f3 caves.\" He added, \"All my love and recognition for your great work and business vision, which has turned this Spanish firm into a world leader in fashion.\"",
      "Mango traces its origins to 1984, when Andic, who is of Turkish origin, opened his first shop on the Paseo de Gracia, Barcelona's famous shopping street, with the help of his older brother Nahman.",
      "It was hugely successful. Spain had just emerged from a decades-long dictatorship that ended with the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, and consumers were hungry for more modern clothes.",
      "\"His departure leaves a huge void, but we are all, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements. It is up to us, and this is the best tribute we can make to Isak and which we will fulfill, to ensure that Mango continues to be the project that Isak aspired to and of which he would be proud,\" Ruiz said.",
      "Mango has consolidated its position as one of the leading international fashion groups, with a major presence in more than 120 markets and 15,500 employees worldwide, according to its website.",

      "\"Parties need more time to agree on what's the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,\" said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks.",
      "Thiaw said the conference was \"like no other\" in the talks' 30-year history. \"We have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.\"",
      "Longer-lasting solutions to drought \u2014 such as the curbing of climate change \u2014 were not a talking point.",
      "Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world's largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves.",
      "Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions.",
      "But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will cost $125 billion worldwide.",
      "Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues.",
      "\"We have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,\" Gomez said. \"Until the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,\" said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks.",

    "story": [
      "Eastern Syria \u2014 CBS News was among the first news outlets to speak on Thursday with Travis Timmerman, an American who was feared dead by family and friends, days after he was freed from a notorious prison in Syria. He said he had spent seven months jailed by the regime of now-ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad before rebels broke down his cell door.",
      "But he was just one of the many thousands of people locked up over half a century of iron-fisted rule by Assad, and his father before him. Many remain missing, and the rebel forces, along with the families of those who've disappeared without a trace, have mounted a herculean effort since Assad fled to Russia on Sunday to find those who vanished.",
      "But there's one group of prisoners that Syria's still-evolving, rebel-led leadership wants to keep behind bars. Five years ago, as U.S.-backed forces wrested control of land held for years by ISIS, CBS News visited a prison where the members of the terrorist group were being held. This week, CBS News returned to the prison in eastern Syria. Guards said it was still holding thousands of ISIS militants, but they wouldn't say exactly how many.",

      "He said his message for the Canadian government would be: \"Why haven't they come? Why haven't they asked about me?\"",
      "The prison is located in part of eastern Syria that's been held by U.S.-backed forces for years. Those largely Kurdish forces currently control around a quarter of Syria, and the warden told CBS News the inmates haven't been told about the collapse of the Assad regime, which was based further south in the capital Damascus, because it could be dangerous.",
      "\"There would be disobedience,\" he said. \"ISIS has been on the move recently, and this prison is important for them.\"",

      "But ISIS is still lurking in the Syrian desert. It's still a threat. In 2022, ISIS fighters attacked the prison, sparking a jailbreak and a bloody 10-day battle to regain control.",

The guards said that had given the women hope they could be rescued.",

      "London - A Chinese businessman with ties to disgraced British royal Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has lost an appeal against a 2023 decision to bar him from the United Kingdom over national security concerns.",
      "The man, who is not named in published judicial documents, had links to the Chinese government and was close enough to Andrew to be invited to his birthday party in 2020, according to a U.K. Special Immigration Appeals Commission judgement.",
      "\"I also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,\" a letter sent to the man by Andrew's top aid, Dominic Hampshire, said, according to the court's judgement, which was published online. \"You should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.\"",
      "The letter from the duke's aid also said: \"We have wisely navigated our way around former Private Secretaries and we have found a way to carefully remove those people who we don't completely trust. Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\"",

      "\"It was assessed that this demonstrated that the Applicant was in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent UK figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,\" the U.K. judgement said Thursday, adding that the man had not given a full accounting of his relationship with Andrew to authorities, which it said had a \"covert and clandestine\" element to it.",
      "The judgement also said the unnamed businessman had concealed ties to bodies connected with the Chinese Communist Party's United Front system, which seeks to gain influence and information to benefit the Chinese government.",

      "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species.",
      "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 660 pounds, or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are only found in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 3,044 mile-long river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province.",
      "The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades due to rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions.\u00a0 According to the World Wildlife Fund, some experts believe there may only be a few hundred Mekong giant catfish surviving.",
      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 6.5 feet that weighed 264 pounds and 288 pounds, respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It's a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\" said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\"This information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\" said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region's cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",
      "\"Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,\" Heng Kong, director of Cambodia's Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement.",
      "Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray.",
      "That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the \"big fish story of the century for the Mekong\", said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong.",
      "\"Hopefully what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong's mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,\" he said.",
      "Threats to endangered aquatic species",
      "Besides overfishing and plastic pollution, the Mekong River Basin has been degraded by upstream dams and climate change, which have had a major impact on water levels in the critically endangered catfish's aquatic home.",
      "According to WWF, threats to the Mekong giant catfish include\u00a0infrastructure development\u00a0such as dams that block migration routes.",
      "\"Without the ability to move up and down rivers, the fish have fewer opportunities to breed,\" WWF says.",
      "Cambodia has placed tough restrictions on fishing in the vast river to try and reduce the number of endangered aquatic species killed in nets.",
      "Numbers of Irrawaddy dolphins -- which once swam through much of the mighty Mekong -- have dwindled despite efforts to preserve them.",
      "In 2022, Cambodian fishermen got a shock when they inadvertently hooked an endangered giant freshwater stingray four metres (13 feet) long and weighing 180 kilos.",
      "Over the past 25 years, the CFA and researchers tagged and released around 100 giant catfish as part of a conservation program that encourages fishermen to report catches of rare species.",
      "Conservationists said the recent giant catfish catches mark \"a new era of conservation\" and \"new hope for the survival of a species that has become increasingly rare in much of its native habitat\".",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke to Rep.-elect Brad Knott, R-N.C., about why he quit his longtime job as a federal prosecutor to run for Congress and what his priorities will be in office.",
      "Republican Brad Knott, who flipped North Carolina\u2019s 13th District red in November, explained to Fox News Digital why he resigned as a federal prosecutor to run for Congress \u2013 and what his priorities will be once he\u2019s sworn into the House next month.",
      "A lifelong North Carolinian and former longtime Assistant U.S. Attorney, Knott said that he considered it a \"high honor\" to spend most of his career working alongside law enforcement, including through organized crime investigations spanning across the country. It was the effects of President Biden and Vice President Harris taking office on local law enforcement in particular that drove Knott to run for Congress.",
      "Observing the impact of the border crisis on communities, Knott said that he couldn't sit by and watch the sheer \"availability of drugs, the presence of violence, the inability to combat it effectively because of just the deluge of people and contraband and criminality that was coming across the border and really the refusal of Washington to do what it could do.\"",
      "\"I had a very, very extensive career in law enforcement, saw a lot in that role and was very much troubled by what I saw on a policy level once Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took the reins in January of 2021,\" Knott said. \"And the deliberate policies and the actions that they took upon taking the oath had a trickle-down effect that was just undeniable. And it was undeniably harmful not only for us as prosecutors, but federal law enforcement, local law enforcement, and then obviously the communities that we are all tasked to protect.\"",

      "Noting executive policies alone, Knott said \"there was an absolute refusal to tackle this problem,\" which he found \"baffling\" given the numbers of drug overdoses, attrition rates of law enforcement agencies and crime.",
      "\"There was just not an appetite at all to tackle this issue. And after a number of years of that, I ultimately followed my heart. We had prayed about this and given the unique posture I had before I decided to run,\" Knott said. \"Seeing crimes all over the country and the effects of it, I thought that it'd be worth trying to run for office in an effort ultimately to fix those issues that I had a firsthand account of seeing and seeing how to combat it effectively.\"",
      "Knott\u2019s endorsement by President-elect Trump in April resulted in his overwhelming May run-off primary win, staving off the prior GOP front-runner Kelly Daughtry. He went on to defeat Democrat Frank Pierce on Election Day last month, winning the redrawn district now covering all or parts of the eight counties in or near the state capital of Raleigh.",
      "THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL",
      "The highlight of campaigning for office, Knott said, was door knocking and hosting town halls for the opportunities to speak and interact with voters firsthand.",
      "\"It's essential to do that because it gives you a window, a front row seat and to what people are actually focused on,\" Knott said. \"It cuts through the noise. It cuts through the media. And in my old job, it's like getting to talk to the jury. It just goes right to the relevant party.\"",
      "Through those conversations, Knott said the people of the 13th district expressed \"a fairly consistent basket of issues\" involving the border crisis' strain of resources on local police and first responders, and in schools and hospitals.",
      "\"But beyond that, there was an overwhelming sense that the country was just headed in the wrong direction,\" Knott told Fox News Digital. \"And from a priority standpoint, I think many people realize that the last administration, the current administration, but soon to be the last administration, were prioritizing things that most Americans just did not agree with. There's real suffering in the United States right now, and there's a very real misconception that the economy is doing well, that the economy is robust. It is not robust. And most people in the 13th District had a real understanding of just how limited the economy is.\"",
      "Knott stressed that the United States is $36 trillion in debt \u2013 and regardless of their background, he said voters overwhelmingly felt their taxpayer dollars were funneled to illegal immigrants and conflicts abroad, rather than Americans at home.",
      "\"Most people are struggling and struggling mightily. And whether it's sending tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars abroad, tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars to illegal immigrants, the promulgation of thousands of regulations that strangle small businesses, essentially enabling only the connected and the big businesses to thrive,\" Knott said. \"And again, the overall sentiment was the country is just headed in the wrong direction. And the path we're on, it needs to change. And so getting out into the community, our belief about getting into the race was certainly affirmed that the people, regardless of race, regardless of class, regardless of of politics, really, they wanted they wanted meaningful changes to obvious problems.\"",
      "\"We are $36 trillion in debt. What have you received for all of that spending?\" Knott asked, stating that \"we are going to have to pay that back for no services rendered.\"",
      "As for the border crisis, Knott condemned how the U.S. government \"literally borrowed money from other countries, from the taxpayers, their future earnings to subsidize the illegal immigration invasion,\" as \"we were spending tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars a year over the last couple of years paying for illegal immigrants to be here, to be educated here, to eat here, to sleep here. And incentivizing more of it.\"",
      "\"That's just one example of the gross incompetence, but the unbelievable power of Washington,\" Knott said.",
      "UKRAINE AID",
      "The Biden administration is rushing to dispense billions more in U.S. aid to Ukraine before Trump takes office. Additional assistance amid what is nearly a three-year-long conflict will be deliberated by the new Congress, controlled by the GOP in both chambers, as Trump is expected to pressure Ukraine and Russia to come to a cease-fire agreement.",
      "Trump with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at The Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris on Dec. 7, 2024.\u00a0 (SARAH MEYSSONNIER/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Knott decried how those in the political class and media simplify the Ukraine debate, arguing that objectives can be \"more complicated than just one line.\" Yet, he says, his focus remains on the American people.",
      "\"Obviously, I think what Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine is, it's horrible. It should not be happening. I believe that Ukraine is certainly entitled to its border, to its sovereignty,\" Knott said. \"And as I agree with President Trump, it needs to stop before tens of thousands of more people are killed. And, at the same time, recklessly dispensing of American dollars to a foreign country with what seems to be very little oversight when we have tremendous problems at home to deal with, that's a very legitimate concern. And there comes a point where we have to question whether or not our involvement is worth it to the American people.\"",
      "\"And we have suffering at home to the degree that we are currently seeing. I prefer to send those dollars and to keep those dollars here. And flatly speaking, we have a $36 trillion debt,\" Knott added. \"And the idea that the United States can just dump tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars into what seem to be very righteous endeavors around the world, we simply can't do that with no end in sight. And so my main focus is guarding the dollar, guarding the hard earnings of Americans, and really focusing as a government on the American citizenry that seems to be so downtrodden and taken advantage of and rebuilding that first.\"",
      "Knott said that Trump has \"made it very clear to the Republican Congress that he expects us to deliver solutions, and he also expects us to work with the other side,\" recognizing the GOP holds control by just a slim margin in the House.",
      "\"I mean, the open border, overregulation, overtaxation, overspending, inflation, the debt, these are not Republican problems to tackle. These are American problems that we must all tackle,\" Knott said. \"And if we don't fix these things quickly, whether it is, you know, tens of millions of people coming across our border and requiring an increased percentage of support from the American taxpayers, whether it's the $36 trillion debt, these issues will ultimately gravely weaken the country. And so without saying my expectations, my hope is that the 119th Congress will find a way to meaningfully address these very serious problems, not for Republican benefit, but for the country's benefit.\"",
      "'UNIFIED GOVERNMENT': INCOMING HOUSE REPUBLICAN REVEALS AGENDA FOR NEW CONGRESS AFTER OUSTING DEM INCUMBENT",
      "NORTH CAROLINA'S 13TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT",
      "Knott will replace Democrat Rep. Wiley Nickel, who did not seek re-election after citing the congressional remapping by Republican state legislators that reconfigured the district to strongly lean red. Nickel, who has signaled interest in running for Senate in 2026, will serve just one term in the House after flipping the seat blue by a razor-thin margin in 2022. Republican Ted Budd, another Trump-backed candidate, represented the district for three terms and that year successfully ran for the U.S. Senate.",
      "Across his district's \"robust and diverse\" set of industries, ranging from agriculture, heavy equipment and infrastructure projects, Knott said he observed a \"common thread\" of business owners expressing frustration with D.C. bureaucracy.",
      "From a conversation with a large scale sweet potato farmer in the district, as North Carolina is one of the largest producers of the crop in the country, Knott said he was told, \"I can deal with the weather, I can deal with storms, I can deal with droughts, but I cannot deal with the regulations that are coming out of Washington, D.C.\" And the incoming congressman heard a similar story from infrastructure companies, which he says relayed how \"the cost of regulatory overreach is becoming so great that they're having to just reallocate resources from building bridges to hiring basically paperwork pushers to deal with the regulations and the bureaucracy maze that is levied upon them.\"",
      "\"In terms of taking that power back, Washington has no business in telling our farmers how to farm, our builders how to build, our teachers how to teach,\" Knott said. \"Kind of reestablishing the priorities in Washington and cutting the reach, sort of removing the tentacles as it is, I think will enable a much greater degree of flourishing for big businesses, small businesses, and really everyone in the 13th District.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s TRUTH Social post endorsing Knott called him a \"Strong Patriot\" who would support law enforcement and the military, secure the border and protect the Second Amendment. As for Daughtry, the daughter of a former longtime Republican legislative leader, Trump described her as a \"RINO\" \u2013 Republican in Name Only \u2013 \"who has given money to Far Left Democrats, pledged to vote for Obama, and is no friend to MAGA.\"",
      "\"President Trump was undeniably effective as he weathered perhaps more resistance that was thrown at him than any candidate, certainly in my lifetime, and maybe the history of the country,\" Knott said. \"And all of that resistance was designed and promulgated from Washington, D.C. And it's a very interesting metaphor that Washington, D.C. was fighting so hard against President Trump, both in his first term as president and when he was running again in the last couple of years. And my entire hope as a soon-to-be congressman is to equal out the balance of power again, to really leverage whatever ability we have as the 119th Congress, to dispense resources and power back to the people of this great country.\"",

      "Trump is expected to bring a major shake-up to federal law enforcement, and while Knott said he does not know Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, or Attorney General pick Pam Bondi personally, he appreciates how Patel has supported \"this decentralizing thrust of putting officers back into communities for safer collaboration, more in-depth collaboration with local law enforcement, and hopefully communities will be made safer.\"",
      "\"There does need to be a rigorous review of how the FBI is being managed and how it's being used and what percentage of the tax dollars that we allocate for the FBI are being used for Washington, D.C., bureaucracy versus putting police on the streets to make American communities safer,\" Knott said, adding that he's confident Patel and Bondi will face \"rigorous review,\" will stand for questioning in the Senate and \"then the right decision will hopefully be made following that review.\"",
      "Recognizing that most first-term members do not get their first committee assignment picks, Knott said his background would make him a good candidate for the Judiciary.",
      "\"That's one of my passions, is to retool the criminal code in such a way that when President Trump leaves office, law enforcement still has the tools to protect the American people rather than relying solely on executive policy and executive power which can be undone with the stroke of a pen like we saw with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"I think we need to rebuild the criminal code in some respects to be a more durable solution for the American people.\"",
      "TRANSGENDER\u00a0BATHROOM CONTROVERSY",

      "Knott, who was on the Hill for orientation while the controversy unfolded, praised the response of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who enacted a policy preserving single-sex facilities on Capitol grounds. While Johnson said everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, the speaker stressed, \"A man cannot become a woman.\"",

      "\"It was one of the unfortunate instances of our orientation insofar as we talked about very serious issues that affect all Americans, not just a very small percentage of society.

But that does not mean that anybody who claims to be a woman should be able to go into a bathroom where women are, where little girls are.\"",
      "\"As the father of two little girls, I stand behind the speaker's sentiment that men should stay in men's locker rooms, women should be and women's locker rooms. And you're born a man. You're born a woman. And we should adhere to that,\" Knott added. \"It's not uniform across the board. There are some people who would abuse that liberty to satisfy their own perversions. And of course, there are some who would not. And the speaker's policy, I think, is the one that's most respectful, it\u2019s most clear, and it's the easiest for us to follow.\"",

      "White House national security spokesman John Kirby addressed the sightings of \u2018drones\u2019 over New Jersey's skies, denying that any evidence suggests a foreign adversary is responsible.",
      "An uptick in alleged drone sightings along the East Coast touched off a flurry of panicked calls for investigation on Friday from residents and state lawmakers, even as public officials stress the aircraft in question are, in fact, being flown lawfully, and a retired port authority aviation expert tells Fox News Digital that fears are overblown.",

      "More recently, lawmakers in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland have reported new alleged drone sightings in their home states, with some witnesses alleging the aircraft in question have been the \"size of cars\" or seen flying above sensitive infrastructure or in restricted airspace.",

      "These remarks have added to a growing collective sense of panic \u2014 but a panic that many in the law enforcement community say is both unfounded and unnecessary.",
      "White House national security communications adviser John Kirby sought to assuage these fears, stressing during a press briefing Thursday that there is \"no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.\"",
      "Others in the law enforcement community also echoed this sentiment. Retired Port Authority Police Detective Lt. John Ryan told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday that the uptick in activity is likely due to two things.",

      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is seen next to a photo of reported drones in Connecticut. Blumenthal is among the lawmakers who have pushed for action on the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).",
      "The first, he said, is that drones are a fast-evolving technology that has seen a boom in both recreational and commercial use in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Federal data on drone registration reflects this sharp uptick in use, most if not all of which is legal. As of October of this year, there were more than 790,000 drones registered with the Federal Aviation Association (FAA), and nearly 400,000 registered commercial drones.",
      "That's \"just to give you an idea\" of the magnitude of the number of legal drones in the U.S., said Ryan, whose extensive police career included serving for a decade as the emergency\u00a0service special operations commander at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, and then later, the chief officer of the Port Authority, whose role includes oversight of all transportation facilities, including Kennedy, LaGuardia and all other airports and ports in the area.",

      "The Pentagon also reiterated this view, noting that an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country, and were not shot down because they were not deemed a threat to national security.",
      "Kirby echoed this sentiment on Thursday. Asked whether the U.S. would consider banning drone use in U.S. airspace, he told reporters, \"I don't know that we're at a stage right now where we're considering that\" as a policy option.",

      "Holiday decoration theft has become an increasingly frustrating issue for many homeowners. Karen from Los Angeles shared her experience with us in an email, stating,",
      "\"We have criminals who visit our neighborhood to not only steal mail and packages but also holiday decorations. I made a Christmas decoration for our mailbox, which was promptly stolen.\"",
      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Smart solutions for festive security",
      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",

      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Key elements of winter testing",
      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",
      "A man holding cryptocurrency coins (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "The solution is end-to-end encryption",
      "To protect private conversations and phone calls, cybersecurity experts recommend using end-to-end encrypted platforms. Jeff Greene, executive assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA, urged Americans to prioritize encrypted communication tools.",
      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "10 ways to protect your personal information against cybersecurity threats",
      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public. The government and the affected companies must prioritize addressing this threat and patching the back doors these cybercriminals are using. We\u2019re witnessing one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history.",

      "When Betsy gave birth in U.S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, to Elizabeth Tait, the firstborn of four children, she mailed a photo to her wounded husband in Vietnam, showing another wounded U.S. Marine holding their day-old daughter. On the back of the picture Betsy wrote: \"Our daughter is beautiful. Praying you live to hold her. Love, Betsy.\"",

      "Over the next thirteen years, she delivered Stuart, Sarah, and Dornin, all in Naval hospitals. As a \"military migrant family,\" Betsy packed and unpacked our household effects and dried our tears at leaving friends as we moved eight times, in and out of military housing and four homes she found, arranged mortgages to buy, and sold, always for a profit.",
      "At every \"duty station\" she found \"a church for us to worship together,\" and the best educational opportunity for each of us from home school to public, Christian and private schools throughout our childhoods. She tutored us in every subject from math to manners and coached us through college applications.",

      "An accomplished equestrienne, Betsy inspired her girls to succeed aboard increasingly challenging mounts from ponies to horses competing in international events. Somehow, she made time to watch and encourage Stuart in Tee-ball, baseball, wrestling, lacrosse, soccer, and football. She loved to introduce Stuart as her \"favorite son.\"",
      "Betsy knew the rules of every sport in which we were engaged and could accurately protest what she deemed a \"bad call\" by a judge, umpire or referee. When the outcome of an event, match, or game was less than we hoped for, she would inspire us with: \"Today was a learning experience, so you can do better next time.\"",

For better than five years none of us, Betsy included, knew much about what Dad was doing, though it seemed he was gone more than he was home. All that changed in November 1986. Suddenly, our house in Great Falls, VA was surrounded 24/7 for months by scores of reporters and cameras.",
      "From 1986-1991, Betsy was a rock of stability and affection for our family during Congressional hearings and the longest, most expensive \"Special Counsel\" prosecution in U.S. History. Throughout, her consistent admonition to us all was: \"Stop reading the headlines of the \u2018Washington Compost!\u2019 Read your Bible instead. This is all going to end well!\" Eventually, it did.",

To protect us, the Naval Intelligence Service secretly transported us to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina \u2013 making Betsy the first military wife and mother since the Civil War to be forced to flee her home because of her husband\u2019s service.",
      "We moved to Narnia Farm in Clarke County, Virginia in 1990, the same year Dad founded Freedom Alliance. Betsy loved being surrounded by cattle, horses, and hosting family and friends from around the world in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains, above the Shenandoah River. All three daughters celebrated our marriages here. When Betsy\u2019s sister Sally retired from a lifetime of teaching, Mom designed, financed, and built a lovely log cabin for her on the west slope of the mountain.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Day 2021, Betsy fell and broke her hip at Cair Paravel, the beautiful South Carolina beach house she designed, financed and built. In April 2021, Dad took her to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN where she was diagnosed with a rare, deadly, degenerative malady: Corticobasal Syndrome.",

      "Dad objected, \"We don\u2019t need hospice! We\u2019re caring for her very well at home!\" Dr. McCabe\u2019s calm response: \"Betsy may not need it quite yet, but you need hospice now!\" He finally relented and she made the call.",

For nearly two years, Dr. Brendan Flynn, DO, and his phenomenal team, especially, Laura J., Lucy, Laura F., Lauren, Maria, and Leigh, et al, provided essential medical equipment, oxygen, hundreds of prescriptions, and guided us on every possible aspect of care for a dying loved one. Debra, Shannon, Tammy, Jennifer, and Princess, our five privately retained, gentle, loving, experienced, and certified caregivers were simply indispensable.",
      "Betsy left us on November 16th, 2024, just three days after Mom and Dad\u2019s 56th Anniversary. She is now in the loving embrace of our Lord and Savior, and we celebrate her extraordinary life. Yet, we will all miss doing with her that which she loved to do with us and so many of you.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 16:19:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is one of the longest-serving senators in Pennsylvania\u2019s history.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is one of the longest-serving senators in Pennsylvania\u2019s history. But his run of electoral success ended last month when he narrowly lost to Republican challenger Dave McCormick.",
      "Now, with just weeks remaining in his 18-year Senate career, Casey is reflecting on what went wrong for him and his party in what was the most consequential battleground state on the map. Casey was the only Democratic Senate candidate running in a presidential battleground who lost his race, falling to McCormick by roughly 15,200 votes as President-elect Donald Trump built a far more substantial victory in the Keystone State than he did in 2016.",
      "Although Democrats were wrecked up and down the ballot in Pennsylvania, Casey doesn\u2019t think the party needs to rip up its playbook. In fact, he thinks the factor that will help them the most is not having to face Trump on the ballot again.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s about as strong a Republican candidate as they\u2019ve had for president in my lifetime,\u201d said Casey, who has served in statewide office for three decades and whose father served as a two-term governor of the state.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Casey discussed this year\u2019s campaign, what\u2019s next for him and his party, and the highlights of his Senate career.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.",
      "NBC NEWS: What went wrong in Pennsylvania this year?",
      "CASEY: Well, I think we\u2019ll know a lot more over time, but obviously, when President Trump was running as strong as he ran, that was going to, and it did, affect the results all across the ticket. So that\u2019s certainly one, what I would call a substantial factor. \u2026",
      "Just in our race, I think the combined impact of the Trump wave, plus the $150 million spent against me by three super PACs, that had an impact, as well as the presidential race. It\u2019s harder for me to analyze that because I just wasn\u2019t paying as close attention to the data there. But obviously, for probably a variety of reasons, President Trump had his strongest performance ever in Pennsylvania of the three races and got about 50%.",
      "NBC NEWS: And why do you think he did run as strong as he did in Pennsylvania? I mean, you have served there in elected office for many, many years, and have seen the state go through a number of political cycles. What do you think this time around made it so fertile for the former president?",
      "CASEY: Well, I do think that the economy \u2014 and principally the driver of that was inflation, even though it had come down substantially, way down well before the election \u2014\u00a0there was a sense among folks that the economy was better under his administration. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate, but that\u2019s the perception that people had, and that if he was able to achieve that once, he could do it again. So that drove it.",
      "And I think there\u2019s no question about the fact that border security was a major issue, and we heard about that all the time. But I think if you had to boil it down to one or two words, it\u2019d be \u201ccosts\u201d or \u201ccost of living.\u201d And that\u2019s why when I was making the argument on greedflation and shrinkflation, confronting the fact, the reality that large multinational corporations were jacking up their prices, people understood that I was fighting for them, and they understood that that was the reality in their lives, and they knew that corporate greed is one of the drivers of inflation.",
      "So I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why our race ended up as close as it did, because we were, I was, connecting on the economic issues, and that certainly made our prospects maybe a little better.",
      "NBC NEWS: I know you and President Biden have a relationship that dates back many years. When you look at your race and just how close it was, do you think it would have made a difference if the president had either gotten out of the race earlier, had stepped aside to allow for a primary, or would it have been potentially decisive in your direction if he had stayed in and campaigned through the election with himself at the top of the ticket?",
      "CASEY: I guess the short answer is I don\u2019t know and nobody knows. It\u2019s just all speculation. But look, I\u2019ve had a great privilege to serve the people of our state for 28 years \u2026 and I was also fortunate to be in the Senate at moments where legislation not only passed, but legislation that I worked on was passing that will shape the lives of Americans, not just for years, but for generations.",
      "NBC NEWS: Have you spoken with President Biden since the election? What thoughts did he share with you? And then is there anything that you\u2019re really looking for him to accomplish before leaving office, as well as is there anything else that you would really like to accomplish before leaving office?",
      "CASEY: Yes, I\u2019ve spoken to [the president] but not at any length where we were analyzing the election. And I do think that it\u2019ll take longer to fully analyze the election.",
      "But number one, I hope he\u2019ll continue as he has to get more and more resources to Ukraine, to fight against a murderous dictator, Vladimir Putin, and to fortify the Ukrainian military so they can continue to confront that enemy. And by the way, an enemy of the United States as well. I don\u2019t know what the next administration will do, but I hope they don\u2019t abandon the people of Ukraine and allow Vladimir Putin to take over a free people.",
      "Obviously, on the domestic front, anything the president and his administration can do to get dollars out the door, whether it\u2019s infrastructure dollars or other dollars for Pennsylvania, we\u2019ll continue to work with them on that.",
      "I\u2019m still trying to get legislation passed too as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, potentially, but it\u2019s an uphill climb to make some progress on so-called \u201coutbound investment,\u201d to be able to limit the investment that American corporations make in China that could under undermine our national security, is legislation that Sen. Cornyn from Texas and I worked on for years. We got 91 votes in the Senate a couple of years ago. \u2026 We want to actually pass it and have it enacted into law.",
      "I\u2019m also working to finally get into law \u2014 I mean, I may not get there \u2014 but we\u2019re pushing very hard to pass legislation that would finally prevent companies from paying subminimum wages to people with disabilities. \u2026 I\u2019ve had bipartisan legislation in the Senate to get that done. We\u2019re hoping we can complete that by the end of the year.",
      "NBC NEWS: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen some folks that pay a lot attention to elections have been speculating whether Pennsylvania might be going the way of Ohio, where it was once a very competitive state, Democrats routinely won there, and now they\u2019re essentially locked out, especially after Sen. Sherrod Brown was defeated last month. Do you see this year\u2019s election as an aberration, a speed bump amid a long line of Democratic wins that have happened [in Pennsylvania] in recent years? Or are you concerned that this might be a harbinger of more Republican wins to come?",
      "CASEY: I think it\u2019s probably premature to make an assessment as to whether we\u2019re going in one direction decidedly or the other. But I will say there were factors in this election that won\u2019t be at play, or won\u2019t be relevant in 2028. And one of them [is] Donald Trump will not be a candidate for president. \u2026 I think he\u2019s about as strong a Republican candidate as they\u2019ve had for president in my lifetime.",
      "Nixon won by a landslide in 1972, Reagan had a landslide as well, but since those days, since at least since the early \u201980s, they have not had a presidential candidate that ran as strongly in Pennsylvania as he did.",
      "NBC NEWS: I don\u2019t know how many conversations you\u2019ve had with others in the party about how to move forward and what if anything needs to change, but what do you think the party needs to adapt or adjust to to be successful in the future?",
      "CASEY: Part of it isn\u2019t to rewrite the whole approach. Part of it is to do what I\u2019ve been doing, and a lot of senators have done, governors have done, but do more of it, and that\u2019s to go to every community, as I\u2019ve been doing for years, to talk about not just local issues, but local priorities that you\u2019re working on. And I was able to go to every community in the state, and I could point to specific investments in that county that occurred only just in the last four years. I didn\u2019t even have to go back even further than four years.",
      "So we have to continue to do more of that, to focus, to make the connection for constituents \u2026 between the work you\u2019re doing in Washington and how you deliver for them.",
      "I think we have to continue to speak directly to this issue of costs. That\u2019s why this debate in 2025 about the tax bill will be important, because one way or the other families are going to lose or win in the tax bill. There\u2019s not going to be much in between. Either working families, middle-class families, will get a significant tax break, or a significant \u2014 maybe even unprecedented \u2014 tax cut will go to big corporations, the billionaires and those who are the wealthiest in the country, because you can\u2019t do both. It\u2019s just impossible to do that.",
      "And that will tell America a lot about who\u2019s on their side, especially if you\u2019re in the middle class or struggling to get to the middle class. And I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for Democrats to lay out early the stakes of that debate and to tell people what\u2019s at stake for them and their family, and then fight very hard to win that battle, so the middle class wins and big corporations and billionaires lose.",
      "And I think it\u2019s not something where you can try to split it down the middle. Because last time Republicans were in charge, the middle class got screwed, and big companies and very wealthy Americans got a record tax break. And that\u2019s not something our country should endure again.",
      "NBC NEWS: Did you find when you were on the trail this year, and I know you focused on this a lot, right, laying out how the legislation in Washington that you guys had passed was impacting people\u2019s counties directly, how the dollars were being spent there. Did that resonate with voters? And were voters really aware of how that legislation was affecting them at the local level?",
      "CASEY: There\u2019s no question that I did, and I\u2019m sure others did. We probably could have done more of it. But it\u2019s difficult in the campaign. It\u2019s also difficult when the investment is not yet manifest, meaning that the bridge is not yet built. The water or sewer system that\u2019s being replaced or repaired is not yet completed. When high-speed internet is deployed and kids in schools and rural communities and rural schools begin to benefit from that, that connection will be made more easily.",
      "But in some ways, we were kind of up against a time frame that didn\u2019t make some of that work manifest. There\u2019s only so much you can do to point to what will come as opposed to what is right in front of people, right already relevant to their community. So I think over time that that story will continue to be told, and I think it\u2019s important for Democrats to continue to point to the investments we made.",
      "NBC NEWS: When you think about the ads that were in your race and in other people\u2019s races, I mean, the airwaves were blanketed with ads on transgender issues in your race. It was on the radio, it was on TV. What kind of impact did you think that had? And how should Democrats speak on these issues going forward?",
      "CASEY: Well, I\u2019m not sure. I really don\u2019t know. I just haven\u2019t seen any analysis of the impact of one issue or one ad or a series of ads. Maybe over time, we\u2019ll have a better sense of that.",
      "But I think, in the end, most of these races do come down to basic issues like the economy, and if you\u2019re in a debate where they believe that change is necessary on the economy, that\u2019s a difficult hill to run up. And I think that was true in most races, even though we could point to the child tax credit in 2021 as really maybe one of the best middle-class tax cuts and tax cuts for people not quite in the middle class, and that put more dollars in people\u2019s pockets. The help we provided on child care helped as well.",
      "The support we were providing on a whole host of fronts for families indicated that we knew that costs were high, we knew that they were struggling. We were trying to help them. And I think the arguments that I made and other Democrats made on corporate greed, I think, broke through.",
      "But I think sometimes when the other side is making a change argument, and they\u2019re making it on the economy, change often prevails.",
      "NBC NEWS: When you\u2019re thinking about what the next four years are going to look like under a Trump presidency, what do you see?",
      "CASEY: Well, I\u2019m concerned about a number of major issues that are important to families, starting with what I mentioned earlier, the tax bill. I worry that Republicans with a House majority, Senate majority and a president will do what they did last time in 2017, which is ram through a tax bill that will benefit the most wealthy.",
      "And at the time, President Trump was very clear about that. He told very wealthy people at Mar-a-Lago, \u201cI just gave you a huge tax break.\u201d And he did. It was just an enormous tax break for individuals and for corporations.",
      "And what that continued and exacerbated was a problem that\u2019s been with us since the Reagan era in 1981. I mean literally since that year when he took office all the way through the beginning of President Biden\u2019s term, you had large corporations and very wealthy Americans win every tax battle. The only tax battle they really lost was when we passed the [American Rescue Plan], where we said we\u2019re going to invest a lot in a child tax credit. And big corporations and very wealthy Americans are getting nothing, and that\u2019s what should happen in the next tax bill they\u2019ve had. \u2026",
      "And I\u2019m afraid that what the Republicans want in 2025 is to continue that, so that middle-class family in Pennsylvania is going to get a couple hundred and the person who\u2019s in the top 1% will get not just tens of thousands but $50,000, $60,000, when the middle class is getting in the hundreds of dollars. That is highway robbery. That is unjust. It leads to divisions in our society. It crowds out investment we have to make in our children, investments we have to make in job creation and economic growth, and it\u2019s wrong. And that\u2019s one of the things I worry about the most.",
      "On the international front, obviously, I\u2019m very concerned about what the next administration might do with regard to Ukraine and pulling support for Ukraine and allowing Vladimir Putin to do pretty much whatever he wants. That would be a bad day, not just for Ukraine, obviously, but it would be a bad day for our national security.",
      "NBC NEWS: When you look back on your career, what accomplishments are you most proud of? And then what\u2019s next for you?",
      "CASEY: I mentioned a few of these overarching pieces of legislation that I played a role in passing, part of a team that did it, whether it was the Affordable Care Act or the American Rescue Plan, the infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, which allowed us to make investments to combat climate change, but also to cap the cost of prescription drugs and do so many other things.",
      "But I think in an individual sense, legislation that I introduced myself and worked with a Republican to pass over time, certainly the ABLE Act, which allowed families to save for a disability just like for college in a tax-advantaged way; the Campus SaVE Act, which forced colleges and universities to do more to protect women on college campuses from sexual assault; the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which allowed workers, pregnant women on the job, to have more protections than they had prior to that.",
      "The investments we made in infrastructure across the state and roads and bridges and water systems and high-speed internet and so much else. The tax credit for energy communities, these former coal communities that now will be the subject of investment because of a tax credit that I made part of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "In my time in the Senate, I was able to work with three different senators, two Republicans, one Democrat, to confirm 51 federal judges, most of those being district court judges who will serve for life. In fact, I\u2019m in the middle of a vote right now that just started for the last Pennsylvania judge that I\u2019ll play a role in confirming.",
      "In terms of what\u2019s next, I think the short answer is, I don\u2019t know, but I know I have to get a job. But I hope I can combine both a job that provides income \u2014 because I don\u2019t have a trust fund, I need income \u2014 but also allows me to continue to work on issues that relate to children, issues that relate to seniors, people with disabilities, the most vulnerable. So I\u2019m looking for those opportunities, and we\u2019ll see what happens."

      "Democrats, though, don\u2019t believe these new Trump districts are firmly in the GOP\u2019s column, pointing to their downballot candidates who performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris in November and how close they came in the House despite losing the national popular vote.",
      "\u201cI think we got our message out to voters. We need to do more. Clearly, I want to make sure that we have the gavels,\u201d the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s chairwoman, Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., said in a phone interview.\u00a0\u201cBut I think we did a lot of things right in a tough environment across the country because we connected with voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans held the House this year but had a net loss of one seat, even as Trump swept competitive battleground states and made gains in Democratic areas. Democrats need to net just three seats to flip the House in 2026, and they will also have midterm trends on their side. In the last six midterms for a second-term president, the president\u2019s party on average lost 20 House seats, according to data from the American Presidency Project.",
      "The next midterm battles will also be the first tests of how both parties will navigate a world where Trump will never again be atop the ballot.",
      "Republicans, defending a razor-thin majority, are looking to turn the Trump coalition into a durable bloc for other GOP candidates and continue the trends he helped stoke. And Democrats, buoyed by downballot overperformance, are looking to win back working-class voters and voters of color who have backed the president-elect but also have history of backing their party.",
      "A shifting battlefield",
      "This year, just three House Republicans are in seats that Harris carried \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s Don Bacon, Pennsylvania\u2019s Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York\u2019s Mike Lawler \u2014 according to campaign strategists and an analysis from the National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT).",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve all shown an ability to win in Democratic districts in tough environments,\u201d Lawler, who is also weighing a run for governor of New York in 2026, told NBC News.",
      "Three Democrats who had been sitting in Trump districts \u2014 Maine\u2019s Jared Golden, Ohio\u2019s Marcy Kaptur and Washington\u2019s Marie Gluesenkamp Perez \u2014 won re-election. And 10 or 11 other Democrats won their House races even as their districts flipped from backing President Joe Biden in 2020 to supporting Trump this year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know the last time we\u2019ve had more obvious crossover targets coming out of a successful cycle like this,\u201d said Adam Kincaid, the NRRT\u2019s president and executive director, noting there could be 11 Democrats in districts that flipped from Biden to Trump depending on split precinct results in Ohio\u2019s 13th District.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are going to have to go into Trump territory to flip the House,\u201d Kincaid said.",
      "Some Democrats in new Trump districts, such as Rep.-elect Adam Gray of California, Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico and Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, represent seats with sizable Latino populations, underscoring Trump\u2019s gains among this group of voters. This also includes one election-night surprise, with Rep.-elect Nellie Pou winning a closer-than-expected race in New Jersey\u2019s 9th District, which is 44% Hispanic according to census data.",
      "The districts also reflect Trump\u2019s gains among working-class voters. In all but one of those districts, less than 36% of adults hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, which is below the national average. A majority of the Trump/House Democratic districts have a median household income of less than $65,000, which is also below the national median of $78,000.",
      "For Republicans, Trump has shifted their coalition to include more working-class voters and voters of color.",
      "\u201cThat changing coalition for us reshapes the battlefield and creates opportunities in places like Texas-28 or Nevada-3,\u201d said Hudson, referring to Cuellar\u2019s seat and Democratic Rep. Susie Lee\u2019s Nevada district, which also flipped to Trump.",
      "But Democrats say their House candidates\u2019 overperformance gives the party a playbook for the midterms. Democratic candidates in battleground districts outperformed Harris by an average of 2.4 points in counties where less than 30% of voters have a college degree, and by an average of 0.2 points in majority-Latino counties, according to a DCCC analysis shared with NBC News.",
      "DelBene and other party strategists touted Democrats\u2019 individual brands as key to withstanding some broader political forces.",
      "\u201cBoth our incumbents and our candidates running to flip seats, really have always been authentic, independent-minded folks focused on their districts,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "\u201cI feel like I know my district and my constituents know me,\u201d said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., whose district flipped from Biden to Trump. \u201cAnd I know that Donald Trump\u2019s not going to be on the top of the ticket in 2026 and midterms are often very different. And whatever happens, I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d",
      "Mike Smith, president of House Majority PAC, the main Democratic super PAC involved in House races, also said that candidate quality is key to success, along with leveraging demographic shifts and running on a compelling message.",
      "\u201cWhen we have that, it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter whether it\u2019s suburban, rural, working class or not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have candidates that resonate and can win. And we proved that in \u201922 and \u201924, and I think we\u2019re going to see that in a much bigger way in \u201926.\u201d",
      "The super PAC announced Wednesday that it is launching a new recruitment fund, looking to help with research and outreach to potential candidates in key House races. It also released a list of 29 midterm targets, plus 16 additional GOP-held seats that it said could be competitive with the right Democratic candidate on the ballot.",
      "The targets include some Trump seats that were not on this year\u2019s battlefield, like Michigan\u2019s 4th District, represented by GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga. Smith noted that Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer carried the seat in 2022, and that Ottawa County, while heavily pro-Trump, has been moving toward Democrats.",
      "Hudson said he had not seen the target list, but he said Democrats tend to target some \u201creaches\u201d given the small House map. Only a small handful of the 435 seats have flipped in the last two election cycles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got more opportunity to pick up seats than they do,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cSo they can spin it however they want.\u201d",
      "Party challenges",
      "Despite downballot bright spots, some Democrats acknowledged that their party has more work to do to win back key groups of voters, particularly working-class voters and Latinos, and make the case that the party is not singularly focused on opposing Trump.",
      "\u201cThe reality is [that] in voters\u2019 minds, for the past eight years we\u2019ve been the party of opposition. And we\u2019ve got to stand for something,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who has worked in House races and requested anonymity to speak candidly about party strategy.",
      "DelBene said Democrats should continue to focus on issues affecting working families, like the child tax credit.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on making sure we\u2019re getting things done and making a difference for our communities,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, will try to ensure that Trump voters become reliable GOP voters, and some Republicans acknowledged those voters are not in their camp yet.",
      "\u201cJust because you vote for Trump does not make you a Republican,\u201d said Sarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership.",
      "Hudson said Republicans should focus on delivering on key issues to win over those voters and continue to study how to best reach voters who don\u2019t normally show up at the polls.",
      "\u201cIt starts with: Why did they vote for Trump in the first place? And I think it\u2019s because they wanted change, and they were concerned about the cost of things for their family. They\u2019re concerned about crime in their neighborhood and the open border,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cAnd so I think step one is: Deliver on our promises.\u201d",
      "Hudson said Trump will be a key messenger for Republicans in the midterms. Hudson was also not concerned about the prospect of clashing with Trump or his allies in upcoming primaries, noting Trump and the NRCC were often aligned on key races.",
      "\u201cHe understands the importance of holding the House,\u201d Hudson said."

      "BAGHDAD \u2014 She was just 11 when she was sold into wedlock with a man 36 years her senior. In the nine years since, she said, she has been raped, beaten, divorced and returned to her family, who hid her away out of shame and forced her into servitude.",
      "Today she is a sex worker in the Iraqi city of Erbil, having moved there recently from the capital, Baghdad.",
      "Batta said her husband raped her on their wedding night and regularly beat her before he sent her back to her family three years after they were married. Instead of offering sympathy, they treated her as a pariah, she said. NBC News does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault, and it agreed not to use her real name and to use only the first names of her parents.",
      "Now she fears other young girls will be subjected to similar ordeals if lawmakers pass proposed amendments to Iraq\u2019s Personal Status Law that could allow marriage for girls as young as 9, as well as give religious authorities the power to decide on family affairs including marriage, divorce and the care of children.",
      "\u201cChanging the law will give parents the right to sell their young daughters,\u201d Batta said in a telephone interview last month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call it marriage, because when a girl gets married at the age of 9 or 10, it means her family has sold her. It also allows men to exploit the poverty that many Iraqi families are experiencing.\u201d",
      "\u2018She\u2019s still a little girl\u2019",
      "Batta said that a few months after her father, Hussein, told her they were pulling her out of the fourth grade because they could not afford to send her to school, she overheard an argument between her parents.",
      "She said her mother, Hana\u2019a, 55, was shouting at him, saying: \u201cShe is still a little girl. Don\u2019t you fear God? She is still playing with children; how can she bear the responsibility of being a wife? She doesn\u2019t even know how to cook any food; she doesn\u2019t even know how to fry an egg.\u201d",
      "Her father replied that the man who was going to marry her was \u201ca respectable man.\u201d",
      "\u201cYes, he is older than her, but he will treat her well and won\u2019t make her cook. The man just wants to get married,\u201d Batta said she heard him say, before he added, \u201cShe will marry whether you accept or not.\u201d",
      "Batta said she \u201chad just turned 11 when my father asked me to take a shower and wear nice clothes.\u201d Afterward, she said, he took her to a gathering of a group of men, including a cleric. \u201cI later learned that one of them was the man who would be my husband, while the other two were witnesses to the marriage,\u201d she said.",
      "Later, she said, she learned that her father had received 15 million Iraqi dinars, or around $11,300, from the man, part of which he used to buy a new taxi. \u201cI also learned that my husband was 47 years old,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cOn the first night, the night I lost my virginity, I didn\u2019t know what this man was doing. I felt immense pain, and I cried as he knelt over me without being able to move my hands or feet,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to forget this day, even though I will never forget it.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, Batta said, her husband \u201ctreated me well\u201d for the first year of their marriage, but after a year \u201chis behavior towards me changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe started hitting me for anything I did, even if I was just watching television; he would hit me and say that I had no right to watch TV,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ceven servants were treated better than I was.\u201d",
      "When her father died of cirrhosis two years after their wedding, she said, her husband would not allow her to attend the funeral.",
      "Batta said that in July 2016, when she was just 14, he took her to the cleric who married them. Afterward, she said, he took her back to her family home and told her mother, \u201cThis is your daughter, and this is her divorce paper.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mother never let me leave the house because she felt ashamed of what the neighbors would think,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my siblings didn\u2019t treat me well. I became like a servant in the house, having to serve everyone.\u201d",
      "At 16, she said, she decided to run away from home and go to Baghdad. There, she said, she met a woman on social media who offered her a place to stay \u201conly to find out that she ran a brothel.\u201d",
      "\u201cI work for her now,\u201d she said. \u201cI go with the other girls to one of the nightclubs, dancing in front of everyone and seducing men to get as much money as I can from them.\u201d",
      "At the end of each month, she said, the woman \u201cdistributes a quarter of the total amount we managed to obtain over the entire month, while the rest is considered rent and food money.\u201d",
      "\u2018Blatant violation of children\u2019s rights\u2019",
      "Batta is by far not the only child in Iraq to have been married at a young age.",
      "UNICEF reported in April 2023 that 28% of girls are married before the legal age of 18, although under Iraqi law, girls as young as 15 can be married with the consent of judges and their parents.",
      "The potential consequences of child marriage were laid bare in a 2016 report by the United Nations Population Fund on the effects of child marriage in Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdistan region, which said it \u201cusually comes with unhealthy and ill-informed sexual relations that may include unwanted and forced sex, domestic rape, vulnerability to domestic violence and genderbased violence and adultery.\u201d",
      "That ultimately affects \u201cthe physical and mental well-being of child spouses,\u201d the report said.",
      "But lawmakers, predominantly from the Shia Muslim bloc, including the political parties Hikma, State of Law and Hukok, are nonetheless championing amendments to the Personal Status Law, also known as Law 188, suggesting they are in line with both Iraq\u2019s Constitution and Islamic law. Iraq is predominantly Shia; around 40% of the population is Sunni Muslim.",
      "Adopted in 1959, the current law unifies all segments of society under a single code while enshrining the rights of women and children. As well as setting the age of marriage, it addressed child custody, inheritances and alimony payments focused on the welfare of both children and women.",
      "The law \u201cwas one of the most progressive in the Middle East,\u201d according to Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank. It had survived \u201cregime changes, wars, civil wars and conflicts throughout many, many decades,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly proposed amendments would take a large amount of decision-making power away from both families and the courts and place it into the hands of clerics, some of whom set the age of puberty at 9.",
      "As a result, some lawmakers and rights groups are concerned that that would pave the way for legalizing and expanding child marriage in the country.",
      "The parties proposing the changes \u201ccame in promising democracy and a better future for Iraqis,\u201d Mansour said. But they failed to keep these promises, leading to increasing \u201cdisillusionment across the public\u201d and widespread protests calling for better services, increased job opportunities and an end to corruption, he said.",
      "\u201cThe ways in which they tried to gain legitimacy have waned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so this is an attempt by some of them to reassert that they are indeed religious parties and their legitimacy is based around religion.\u201d",
      "Three lawmakers who supported the proposed changes declined to be interviewed.",
      "Some of those pushing for the changes have suggested that they could help lower divorce rates and boost family values.",
      "Speaking to Iraqi broadcaster Al-Forat News in September, lawmaker Dunya Al-Shammari said they would protect \u201cwomen and families from disintegration, and resorting to Islamic law is the best guarantor to preserve these rights.\u201d She added that it would help to \u201cachieve justice between men and women regarding child custody.\u201d",
      "Others, like fellow Shia lawmaker Alya Nassif, called for the proposals to be voted down, as similar amendments were in 2014 and 2017. Calling the proposals \u201cdangerous,\u201d Nassif said the law \u201cthreatens society and families.\u201d She said members of parliament had been presented with \u201ca collection of ideas written on two sheets of paper,\u201d rather than \u201clegal articles that are needed to be discussed for voting.\u201d",
      "Calling the proposed amendments a \u201cblatant violation of children\u2019s rights,\u201d Kurdo Omar, an MP who represents the Kurdistan Alliance, said she thought it would harm Iraq\u2019s \u201creputation both domestically and internationally.\u201d",
      "Both joined a lawmaker boycott of a second reading of the draft bill in early September, which prevented it from taking place, and both hope to scupper the amendments entirely.",
      "Batta hopes they succeed.",
      "\u201cChanging the law will lead many underage girls to face circumstances similar to what I went through,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI am sure that those who are trying to change the law do not allow their daughters to marry at a young age because they do not need the money. The issue is solely about money and nothing else.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re a deep, athletic, physical team. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to build. Been good on the defensive end, defensive-minded, like to junk it up, be aggressive on that end,\u201d Udoka said in the lead-up to the Rockets\u2019 NBA Cup semifinal game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.",
      "When it comes to scoring, though?",
      "\u201cOffensively, we\u2019re a work in progress,\u201d Udoka admitted.",
      "Veteran point guard Fred VanVleet echoed his coach\u2019s assessment.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot of energy and focus, especially for a young group,\u201d VanVleet said about the Rockets\u2019 commitment to defense. \u201cSo I know any time we\u2019re locked in on defense usually bodes well for us, and then it becomes a possession game toward the end of the game. You want to close it out.\u201d",
      "But VanVleet then added, with a smile, \u201cMost of the time we\u2019re not scoring, either.\u201d",
      "Houston\u2019s style of play \u2014 rugged, defensive-minded, physical \u2014 was perhaps never more evident than during the team\u2019s run through the NBA Cup, which ended Saturday in a 111-96 loss to the Thunder.",

The teams combined for only 83 points in the first half, but the Thunder\u2019s individual brilliance on offense eventually made the difference in the second.",
      "\u201cWe started off a little off rhythm, out of rhythm, a couple turnovers. They did, too. It was kind of ugly to start,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut we just never found the rhythm and never found a flow. If you\u2019re not going to make shots against a team like that, it just gradually gets tougher to score. That lack of scoring puts pressure on your defense, and it just kind of compounds things.\u201d",
      "The pressure the Rockets put on their defense is making them such a confounding team this season.",
      "Through the Cup semis, Houston has the fifth-best record and the seventh-best net rating in the NBA. A year after they won 41 games, the Rockets are on pace to win 53.",
      "However, Houston\u2019s offense is an anomaly among its fellow winners. Of the top five teams in the league, the Rockets are the only one with an offense outside the top 10. After the loss to Oklahoma City, the Rockets\u2019 offensive rating fell to 18th.",
      "Houston\u2019s leading scorer, Jalen Green, averages 19 points per game, 40th among all players. Only two players on the team are shooting over 32% from three, and neither are doing so on particularly high volume. Overall, the Rockets have the second-worst field-goal percentage, the third-worst 3-point percentage and the fifth-worst free-throw percentage in the NBA.",
      "Though the old adage is defense wins championships, particularly in today\u2019s NBA, offense really helps, too. Since 2010, only one team with an offense worse than 11th in offensive rating has won a title, the 2022 Warriors, who at least had a generational offensive talent in Stephen Curry. (The teams that finished 11th, the 2020 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers, had LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, respectively.)",

We have to be better offensively,\u201d VanVleet said when he was asked about the team\u2019s process Saturday. \u201cOther than that, I\u2019m not really going to talk about what we want to do here. Coach can probably give you a better answer than that. It\u2019s my job as a point guard to figure out how to get this team to perform better.\u201d"

    "summary": "Bills QB Josh Allen threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns and ran for two more scores against the Lions.",
    "story": [
      "As one of the NFL\u2019s best teams all season, and a legitimate contender to emerge from the NFC and appear in what would be the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl, Detroit has regularly overmatched opponents with physicality and aggression on its way to a 12-1 record.",
      "Yet early in Sunday\u2019s fourth quarter, one decision appeared to indicate a rare admission from the Lions: They simply could not stop the opposing quarterback, and they knew it.",
      "With Detroit trailing the Buffalo Bills with 12 minutes remaining but within 38-28 after having scored a touchdown, coach Dan Campbell called for an onside kick, one of the high-risk calls that has made him famous for his aggression and aided Detroit\u2019s turnaround. The reasoning was obvious to anyone who has watched the NFL for the past month: Having any hope of slowing down Buffalo required keeping the ball away from quarterback Josh Allen.",
      "Instead, Buffalo receiver Mack Hollins recovered the kick by tipping the ball to himself before returning it 38 yards to the doorstep of the end zone. One play later, Allen threw for a touchdown, his fourth total touchdown of the day. Buffalo went on to win 48-42.",
      "A game billed as a potential Super Bowl preview ended as a statement win for the Bills and strengthened Allen\u2019s case to win the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player award.",
      "Two weeks after he became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw, receive and run for touchdowns in the same game as the Bills beat San Francisco and one week after he made more history in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams by becoming the first player to throw for three touchdowns and run for three more in one game, Allen continued his torrid run to hand the Lions only their second loss.",
      "On the road in Detroit, where the Lions had allowed opponents only 20 points per game, Allen threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns and ran for two more scores. In his last three games alone, he has accounted for 14 touchdowns. To put that in perspective, that is one more than the New York Giants, the league\u2019s lowest-scoring team, have produced in their last nine games.",
      "The Bills (11-3) have scored 40-plus points in three consecutive games for the third time in franchise history, joining the 2021 and 1990 teams.",
      "Allen has never been named the league\u2019s MVP, and this season he has produced not only huge numbers but also big moments that could stick with voters. Buffalo has used his arm and legs to knock off a one-loss team (Detroit) in the same season that a fourth-down conversion by Allen beat previously undefeated Kansas City.",
      "Buffalo scored touchdowns on its first three drives Sunday and failed to score on its fourth only because it missed a field goal. In the second half, the Bills scored on five of their six drives before they ran out the clock on their final play after a second onside-kick recovery. It was enough to beat Detroit even though Lions quarterback Jared Goff threw for 494 yards and five touchdowns.",
      "The last three weeks have shown vulnerabilities that make the Bills fallible, from questions about coach Sean McDermott\u2019s clock management decisions in a loss to the Rams to concerns about their defense after Goff\u2019s big game. (The Lions averaged 6.8 yards per play.) But what Buffalo does have is Allen, who has stood apart from even the league\u2019s best players, and Sunday he helped differentiate his team from another of the NFL\u2019s best."

      "\u201cPatrick, his right ankle has been hurt. It\u2019s not broken, but it\u2019s sore,\u201d Kansas City coach Andy Reid said after the game. \u201cHe\u2019ll get started on the rehab part of it as we go, and then we\u2019ll just have to see how he does.

      "Mahomes has played through a high ankle sprain before. He sustained the injury in a January 2023 divisional round playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He missed one quarter of that game before he returned, and he didn\u2019t miss any time the rest of the playoffs, leading the Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory.",
      "Mahomes finished Sunday\u2019s game completing 19 of 38 passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns. He has thrown for 3,348 yards with 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions this season."

      "The wave of \u201cmemecoiners\u201d is a mix of\u00a0longtime bitcoin holders and people simply desperate to change their fortunes in an era of sky-priced homes and equities, according to Toe Bautista, research analyst for GSR, a decentralized finance group. While many memecoin traders, flush from gains thanks to bitcoin\u2019s 130% increase this year \u2014 50% of which has come since Trump\u2019s election last month \u2014 are simply \u201cmoving down the risk curve\u201d into areas of pure speculation, Bautista said.

      "\u201cA lot of it is people thinking, \u2018I can get some sort of edge by having a better chance at a lottery ticket,\u201d Bautista said.",
      "Memecoin buyers and sellers alike are, for the most part, aware that their trading activity amounts to the riskiest kind of gambling, Bautista said. It\u2019s all about exiting one\u2019s position to avoid getting left with \u201cholding the bag\u201d and failing to trade up and strike while the price is hot.",

      "For the most part, the greatest risk in trading memecoins, which tend to be based on the lifespan of viral internet memes, is the meme itself fading away from the cultural zeitgeist. And indeed, the gains from a given news cycle for a very select few can be substantial. Blockchain data shows at least one holder of a coin created in the wake of the Peanut the Squirrel incident last month, which involved the death of a rodent possibly being kept without permission by a New York man, is sitting on nearly half a billion dollars.",
      "Today, that coin, PNUT, is down about half from its peak value of $2.47 as that news story has faded from view.",
      "Yet there are also operational risks to memecoins, as illustrated by the rise and rapid fall of \u201cHawk\u201d coin, released earlier this month by Haliey Welch, a Tennessee woman who has parlayed a viral lewd street interview into a successful podcast.",
      "Over the course of 24 hours, Hawk\u2019s market cap peaked at $500 million before collapsing to $28 million, prompting complaints about dramatic losses in funds. Those complaints have not been independently verified by NBC News.",
      "Facing accusations of insider trading, Welch released a statement saying neither she nor anyone on her team had sold the coins, blaming instead \u201csniper\u201d algorithmic bots designed to sell as prices begin to surge.",
      "Bautista said that indeed, algorithmic trading, which has long been part of mainstream trading on Wall Street, is now routinely deployed in the memecoin space. He estimates that of the top-20 traded coins in crypto, half are memecoins whose trades are almost entirely driven by bots designed to spot and respond to price movements.",
      "Is it legal? Some believe memecoins are permitted because the Securities and Exchange Commission has never formally categorized bitcoin as a security. Yet the agency has taken actions against exchanges that have permitted trading of other tokens. And, crucially, many memecoins, including Fartcoin, do not appear able to be legally purchased from U.S. soil on most of the crypto exchanges offering them.",
      "Ground zero for launching memecoins is a website called Pump.fun, which allows users to \u201claunch a coin that is instantly tradeable in one click for free.\u201d Launched in January 2024, the site has generated over $288.4 million in revenue since its inception, according to analytics data cited by CoinTelegraph, a crypto industry publication.",
      "Earlier this month, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority said the website was not authorized in the country and warned anyone who interacted with a product or service associated with the site had no investor protections.",

      "A spokesperson for the website was not immediately available for comment.",
      "It may be the digital Wild West, but some tools have been developed to help nonsavvy memecoin participants avoid outright scams.

Pump.fun itself says it prevents \u201crugs,\u201d or sudden price dumps, by making sure that any tokens it launches have no presales or small-batch allocations that would benefit insiders.",
      "It is not clear how much longer the current crypto \u201cbull\u201d cycle will last, but at least one analyst believes it is still in relatively early innings given likely developments next year \u2014 namely, potentially further reductions in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and the implementation of more crypto-friendly policies by the Trump administration.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 20:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Beer prices are rising, but some spirits \u2014 including many tequilas and whiskeys \u2014 are seeing price drops that make even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable.",
    "story": [
      "Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last \u2014 but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering.",
      "As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable.",
      "Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago, federal inflation numbers released Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer.",
      "And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices, accusing a major U.S. liquor distributor of favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete.",
      "So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages\u00a0have been relatively modest. Booze costs rose nearly 15% from the first half of 2019 to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs were up only 1.8% since the year before, while inflation overall was 2.7%.",
      "You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it\u2019s better than the stuff you\u2019re paying more for.",
      "Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S.",
      "Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,\u201d said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. \u201cIt\u2019s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.\u201d",
      "That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showed many households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers\u2019 wallets with increasingly competitive deals and discounts.",
      "\u201cAs a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,\u201d Lodewijks said of inflation\u2019s impact on alcohol in recent years. \u201cWhen prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.\u201d",
      "His firm flagged in September that sales volumes had declined more than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makers have been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amid growing interest in nonalcoholic mocktails and signs that younger people are thinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year.",
      "U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who have faced a yearslong pullback after the previous decade\u2019s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants, accounting for over half of booze sales in those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast.",
      "Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week\u2019s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump \u2014 climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have been passing on higher costs to their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers.",
      "\u201cWhile mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, consumers won\u2019t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.\u201d",
      "There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers\u2019 costs. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in November led some beer makers to voice fresh worries about tariffs, after his first round hit the aluminum and steel-reliant industry in 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which had waved off trade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied.",
      "In the meantime, some of the industry\u2019s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season.",
      "The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantage as demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas \u2014 many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said.",
      "\u201cWhat consumers are saying is, \u2018I\u2019m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it\u2019s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year.",
      "Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said.",
      "Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky, according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production.",
      "\u201cShop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,\u201d he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. \u201cOften it\u2019s better than the stuff you\u2019re paying more for.\u201d"

      "DETROIT \u2014 For years,\u00a0General Motors\u00a0CEO and Chair Mary Barra has promised a new future for the company, away from a stodgy metal-bending automaker into a tech-driven, forward-thinking company poised for growth.",
      "Part of the plan was for GM\u2019s innovation division to identify trillions \u2014\u00a0yes, trillions\u00a0\u2014 of dollars in new market opportunities such as electric commercial vehicles, auto insurance, military defense, autonomous vehicles and even, eventually, the potential for \u201cflying cars,\u201d also known as urban air mobility.",
      "\u201cWe are creating world-class technology solutions and services that will change the way people move, along with new fleet solutions and entirely new business models,\u201d Barra said during a\u00a0virtual CES keynote\u00a0in January 2022.",
      "While GM has declined to disclose how much revenue such businesses have produced, Barra, with the\u00a0ending of its Cruise robotaxi operations\u00a0on Tuesday, made it clear that the automaker\u2019s growth priorities have shifted amid a\u00a0broader, industrywide retrench\u00a0to preserve capital. Companies including GM are now focused on more \u201ccore\u201d operations and adjacent business opportunities, including software, EVs and \u201cpersonal autonomous vehicles.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to really understand the cost of running a robotaxi fleet, which is fairly significant, and, again, not our core business,\u201d Barra said during a Tuesday call with Wall Street analysts.",
      "From CNBC:",
      "3 gift recommendations from CNBC Make It staff that I actually bought for myself\u2014and use every day Why the U.S. government is saying all citizens should use end-to-end encrypted messaging More than half of Gen X parents worry about financially supporting their kids into adulthood, survey shows",
      "3 gift recommendations from CNBC Make It staff that I actually bought for myself\u2014and use every day",
      "Why the U.S. government is saying all citizens should use end-to-end encrypted messaging",
      "More than half of Gen X parents worry about financially supporting their kids into adulthood, survey shows",
      "The driverless ride-hailing service was supposed to be the\u00a0shining star\u00a0of GM\u2019s growth opportunities, with executives just a few years ago referring to it as an $8 trillion market opportunity that the automaker would lead. That included former executives touting\u00a0$50 billion in revenue\u00a0by the end of this decade, and\u00a0Cruise being valued\u00a0at more than $30 billion.",
      "Instead, after spending more than $10 billion on Cruise since acquiring it in 2016, GM is ending the robotaxi business and folding Cruise\u2019s operations and an undetermined number of its nearly 2,300 employees into the automaker.",
      "Saving capital",
      "As part of the wind down, GM is expected to disclose additional expenses from employee separation packages and repurchasing equity investments from outside investors, among other costs, in the next year.",
      "GM cited the increasingly competitive robotaxi market, capital allocation priorities, and the considerable time and resources necessary to grow the business as reasons for its decision.",
      "The automaker\u2019s main competitor was\u00a0Alphabet-backed Waymo, which is now the last entity with any notable public operations. Others, most notably\u00a0Tesla, have ambitions for\u00a0robotaxi businesses, but have failed to commercialize those operations thus far.",
      "To GM\u2019s credit, Wall Street, which previously pushed for such growth businesses, applauded the decision to end Cruise\u2019s robotaxi ambitions. Shares of the company were initially higher, before ending the week level with when the announcement was made.",
      "GM, like other companies, has quickly shifted from trying to impress Wall Street with growth initiatives, including generating\u00a0$280 billion in new businesses\u00a0by 2030, to refocusing efforts on its core business to generate profits amid economic and recessionary concerns.",
      "Analysts largely viewed GM\u2019s decision as positive, saving the automaker more than $1 billion in capital annually, which they expect could be used for\u00a0additional share buybacks, including a target to lower its outstanding shares to under 1 billion.",
      "\u201cIt has been apparent for some time now that most investors have removed Cruise from their GM valuations, so today\u2019s news comes as less of a surprise,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a Tuesday investor note.",
      "Cruising no more",
      "GM will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC with GM technical teams. Barra repeatedly said last week that the automaker is not giving up on vehicle autonomy; it will focus on personal autonomous vehicles instead of robotaxis.",
      "But it\u2019s hard to ignore that Cruise is GM\u2019s latest mobility venture or growth business to fold or not live up to expectations.",
      "GM\u2019s plans to diversify its business through fashionable industries such as ridesharing and other \u201cmobility\u201d ventures \u2014 a\u00a0trendy term\u00a0used previously by the industry for growth initiatives \u2014 or startups have largely fallen flat since the automaker started investing in such growth areas in 2016.",
      "The automaker earlier this year folded its BrightDrop EV commercial vans into Chevrolet amid lackluster sales.\u00a0It\u2019s also failed to announce any meaningful plans for fuel cells for tie-ups with boats, trains and airplanes, and it\u2019s\u00a0shuttered several prior\u00a0\u201cmobility\u201d businesses.",
      "Not all of GM\u2019s noncore businesses that were launched in recent years have failed. GM Energy and the BrightDrop commercial EV unit continue to operate under the\u00a0automaker\u2019s\u201d Envolve\u201d fleet business.",
      "GM\u2019s financial arm, meanwhile, continues to operate an\u00a0insurance business\u00a0that was launched in late 2020 as part of its growth initiatives with its OnStar telematics and data unit. GM on Friday said the operations are now in 12 states, and remain \u201cwell positioned for long-term success.\u201d",
      "GM also continues to operate a military defense unit and fuel cell business that have both recently announced new contracts or partnerships. That includes hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for GM Defense.",
      "Super Cruise",
      "Other than saving capital, GM\u2019s silver lining for canceling the Cruise robotaxi business was that it sees more promise in continuing to develop its\u00a0Super Cruise\u00a0hands-free advanced driver assistance system. That includes more semi-automated and, eventually, autonomous capabilities.",
      "GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016. However, it was an infamously slow ramp up until recently, when the automaker began rolling it out across its lineup. That started in 2021 and has continued to expand to more than 20 models, including high-volume vehicles such as its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.",
      "\u201cThe strategy shift demonstrates that GM continues to believe in the potential of AV technology for personal vehicles. Going forward, GM will focus on improving the capabilities of SuperCruise, which will be further enabled by ongoing technological advancements including in artificial intelligence (AI),\u201d BofA Securities\u2019 John Murphy said in a Wednesday investor note.",
      "On the other side of the coin, Murphy also points out that the move could imply that other companies such as Waymo and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0\u201chave better tech and/or that the market may not be appealing for later entrants.\u201d",
      "First-mover advantage lost",
      "GM wasn\u2019t expected to be a \u201clater entrant\u201d in\u00a0robotaxis. In fact, it was the\u00a0first to offer such rides\u00a0to the public, and many believed it was one of the leaders until last year, when the company grounded its driverless operations in October 2023 following a\u00a0crash involving a pedestrian\u00a0in San Francisco.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0fined Cruise $1.5 million\u00a0after the company failed to disclose details of the crash, which included a pedestrian being dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle.",
      "A third-party probe into the incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that\u00a0led to the accident. The probe also investigated allegations of a cover-up by Cruise leadership but found no evidence to support those claims.",
      "The report outlines multiple instances in which then-CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, who resigned from the company in November 2023, made the final calls to withhold information, specifically regarding media.",
      "Vogt was not enthusiastic about GM\u2019s decision to kill the robotaxi operations. He\u00a0posted on X\u00a0after the announcement, \u201cIn case it was unclear before, it is clear now: GM are a bunch of dummies.\u201d",
      "Vogt\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0pointed out GM\u2019s history of having a first-mover advantage with technology, as it did with Cruise and Super Cruise, and squandering it. GM had a similar path with EV tech, like the EV1 \u2014 a battery-electric vehicle produced in the 1990s \u2014 and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle in the 2010s, which were both abandoned by the company.",
      "GM follows several other companies in abandoning robotaxis, including its closest crosstown rival\u00a0Ford Motor, which shut down its\u00a0Argo AI autonomous vehicle unit\u00a0with Volkswagen in 2022.",
      "The robotaxi leader in the U.S. remains Waymo, which continues to expand operations for its publicly available fleet in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and will soon debut in Miami, Atlanta and Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cIn many ways this announcement highlights the economic challenges of scaling a robotaxi network and the role rideshare platforms can play as AVs attempt to commercialize (a bullish indicator), but we think the more tangible impact right now is on the partnership ecosystem given Waymo is already scaling despite the costs and Tesla has ambitions to do so as well,\u201d Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in an investor note last week."

      "\"Americans gave President Trump a mandate on November 5 to implement and pass his top priorities as quickly as possible. The Senate must now do its part to have Cabinet appointees confirmed and ready to go to ensure this conservative mandate can be carried out effectively,\" Heritage Executive Vice President Ryan Walker said in a statement announcing the campaign.",
      "The pressure campaign and primary threats aren't the first time Tillis has faced scrutiny for deviating from Trump. Last year, the North Carolina Republican Party censured Tillis at its annual convention, citing Tillis' \u201cblatant violations of our party platform.\u201d",
      "On NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Graham dismissed the pressure campaign against GOP senators, telling moderator Kristen Welker: \"At the end of the day, yeah, people will push you to do things up here. It\u2019s up to you to resist.\"",
      "He added that he's open to meeting with Trump's selections and fairly weighing each of them on their merits, saying, \"But I\u2019m going to do what I think is best for the country, and that\u2019s have a process that works.\"",
      "Tillis on Sunday downplayed the hesitation of some GOP senators who haven't publicly supported each of Trump's picks yet, including Patel and Hegseth.",
      "\u201cKash Patel, who I\u2019m working with, because he\u2019s on my committee of jurisdiction, is going to enjoy solid Republican support on the Senate floor and coming out of the committee,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "Tillis said Hegseth \"is going to have to go to the committee and answer some questions about organizational experience, some of his past marriages, those sorts of things. All of that\u2019s fair game when you\u2019re running for a Cabinet or sub-Cabinet position.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If you ask the famously blunt Ime Udoka, head coach of the Houston Rockets, to describe the identity of his team, he won\u2019t sugarcoat it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re a deep, athletic, physical team. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to build. Been good on the defensive end, defensive-minded, like to junk it up, be aggressive on that end,\u201d Udoka said in the lead-up to the Rockets\u2019 NBA Cup semifinal game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.",
      "When it comes to scoring, though?",
      "\u201cOffensively, we\u2019re a work in progress,\u201d Udoka admitted.",
      "Veteran point guard Fred VanVleet echoed his coach\u2019s assessment.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot of energy and focus, especially for a young group,\u201d VanVleet said about the Rockets\u2019 commitment to defense. \u201cSo I know any time we\u2019re locked in on defense usually bodes well for us, and then it becomes a possession game toward the end of the game. You want to close it out.\u201d",
      "But VanVleet then added, with a smile, \u201cMost of the time we\u2019re not scoring, either.\u201d",
      "Houston\u2019s style of play \u2014 rugged, defensive-minded, physical \u2014 was perhaps never more evident than during the team\u2019s run through the NBA Cup, which ended Saturday in a 111-96 loss to the Thunder.",
      "In their quarterfinal matchup with the Golden State Warriors, the Rockets won a 91-90 rock fight. Houston held Golden State to only four points in the final four minutes and change \u2014 but the Rockets scored only nine points in the final five minutes, barely enough to win.",

      "Randy Moss announces he is battling cancer",
      "Saturday\u2019s game between Houston and Oklahoma City was a tilt between the league\u2019s top two defenses, and it played out as such for the opening 24 minutes. The teams combined for only 83 points in the first half, but the Thunder\u2019s individual brilliance on offense eventually made the difference in the second.",
      "\u201cWe started off a little off rhythm, out of rhythm, a couple turnovers. They did, too. It was kind of ugly to start,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut we just never found the rhythm and never found a flow. If you\u2019re not going to make shots against a team like that, it just gradually gets tougher to score. That lack of scoring puts pressure on your defense, and it just kind of compounds things.\u201d",
      "The pressure the Rockets put on their defense is making them such a confounding team this season.",
      "Through the Cup semis, Houston has the fifth-best record and the seventh-best net rating in the NBA. A year after they won 41 games, the Rockets are on pace to win 53.",
      "However, Houston\u2019s offense is an anomaly among its fellow winners. Of the top five teams in the league, the Rockets are the only one with an offense outside the top 10. After the loss to Oklahoma City, the Rockets\u2019 offensive rating fell to 18th.",
      "Houston\u2019s leading scorer, Jalen Green, averages 19 points per game, 40th among all players. Only two players on the team are shooting over 32% from three, and neither are doing so on particularly high volume. Overall, the Rockets have the second-worst field-goal percentage, the third-worst 3-point percentage and the fifth-worst free-throw percentage in the NBA.",
      "Though the old adage is defense wins championships, particularly in today\u2019s NBA, offense really helps, too. Since 2010, only one team with an offense worse than 11th in offensive rating has won a title, the 2022 Warriors, who at least had a generational offensive talent in Stephen Curry. (The teams that finished 11th, the 2020 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers, had LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, respectively.)",
      "Houston certainly doesn\u2019t have that level of offensive player. The Rockets, despite being a top team, may not even have an All-Star. (Center Alperen Sengun has the best case, though.)",
      "For now, Houston seems well aware its current style of play will be a hurdle if it wants to reach its ultimate goal.",
      "\u201cWhat I will say publicly is we have to figure it out. We have to be better offensively,\u201d VanVleet said when he was asked about the team\u2019s process Saturday. \u201cOther than that, I\u2019m not really going to talk about what we want to do here. Coach can probably give you a better answer than that. It\u2019s my job as a point guard to figure out how to get this team to perform better.\u201d"

      "DETROIT \u2014 For years,\u00a0General Motors\u00a0CEO and Chair Mary Barra has promised a new future for the company, away from a stodgy metal-bending automaker into a tech-driven, forward-thinking company poised for growth.",
      "Part of the plan was for GM\u2019s innovation division to identify trillions \u2014\u00a0yes, trillions\u00a0\u2014 of dollars in new market opportunities such as electric commercial vehicles, auto insurance, military defense, autonomous vehicles and even, eventually, the potential for \u201cflying cars,\u201d also known as urban air mobility.",
      "\u201cWe are creating world-class technology solutions and services that will change the way people move, along with new fleet solutions and entirely new business models,\u201d Barra said during a\u00a0virtual CES keynote\u00a0in January 2022.",
      "While GM has declined to disclose how much revenue such businesses have produced, Barra, with the\u00a0ending of its Cruise robotaxi operations\u00a0on Tuesday, made it clear that the automaker\u2019s growth priorities have shifted amid a\u00a0broader, industrywide retrench\u00a0to preserve capital. Companies including GM are now focused on more \u201ccore\u201d operations and adjacent business opportunities, including software, EVs and \u201cpersonal autonomous vehicles.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to really understand the cost of running a robotaxi fleet, which is fairly significant, and, again, not our core business,\u201d Barra said during a Tuesday call with Wall Street analysts.",

      "More than half of Gen X parents worry about financially supporting their kids into adulthood, survey shows",
      "The driverless ride-hailing service was supposed to be the\u00a0shining star\u00a0of GM\u2019s growth opportunities, with executives just a few years ago referring to it as an $8 trillion market opportunity that the automaker would lead. That included former executives touting\u00a0$50 billion in revenue\u00a0by the end of this decade, and\u00a0Cruise being valued\u00a0at more than $30 billion.",
      "Instead, after spending more than $10 billion on Cruise since acquiring it in 2016, GM is ending the robotaxi business and folding Cruise\u2019s operations and an undetermined number of its nearly 2,300 employees into the automaker.",
      "Saving capital",
      "As part of the wind down, GM is expected to disclose additional expenses from employee separation packages and repurchasing equity investments from outside investors, among other costs, in the next year.",
      "GM cited the increasingly competitive robotaxi market, capital allocation priorities, and the considerable time and resources necessary to grow the business as reasons for its decision.",
      "The automaker\u2019s main competitor was\u00a0Alphabet-backed Waymo, which is now the last entity with any notable public operations. Others, most notably\u00a0Tesla, have ambitions for\u00a0robotaxi businesses, but have failed to commercialize those operations thus far.",
      "To GM\u2019s credit, Wall Street, which previously pushed for such growth businesses, applauded the decision to end Cruise\u2019s robotaxi ambitions. Shares of the company were initially higher, before ending the week level with when the announcement was made.",
      "GM, like other companies, has quickly shifted from trying to impress Wall Street with growth initiatives, including generating\u00a0$280 billion in new businesses\u00a0by 2030, to refocusing efforts on its core business to generate profits amid economic and recessionary concerns.",
      "Analysts largely viewed GM\u2019s decision as positive, saving the automaker more than $1 billion in capital annually, which they expect could be used for\u00a0additional share buybacks, including a target to lower its outstanding shares to under 1 billion.",
      "\u201cIt has been apparent for some time now that most investors have removed Cruise from their GM valuations, so today\u2019s news comes as less of a surprise,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a Tuesday investor note.",
      "Cruising no more",
      "GM will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC with GM technical teams. Barra repeatedly said last week that the automaker is not giving up on vehicle autonomy; it will focus on personal autonomous vehicles instead of robotaxis.",
      "But it\u2019s hard to ignore that Cruise is GM\u2019s latest mobility venture or growth business to fold or not live up to expectations.",
      "GM\u2019s plans to diversify its business through fashionable industries such as ridesharing and other \u201cmobility\u201d ventures \u2014 a\u00a0trendy term\u00a0used previously by the industry for growth initiatives \u2014 or startups have largely fallen flat since the automaker started investing in such growth areas in 2016.",
      "The automaker earlier this year folded its BrightDrop EV commercial vans into Chevrolet amid lackluster sales.\u00a0It\u2019s also failed to announce any meaningful plans for fuel cells for tie-ups with boats, trains and airplanes, and it\u2019s\u00a0shuttered several prior\u00a0\u201cmobility\u201d businesses.",
      "Not all of GM\u2019s noncore businesses that were launched in recent years have failed. GM Energy and the BrightDrop commercial EV unit continue to operate under the\u00a0automaker\u2019s\u201d Envolve\u201d fleet business.",
      "GM\u2019s financial arm, meanwhile, continues to operate an\u00a0insurance business\u00a0that was launched in late 2020 as part of its growth initiatives with its OnStar telematics and data unit. GM on Friday said the operations are now in 12 states, and remain \u201cwell positioned for long-term success.\u201d",
      "GM also continues to operate a military defense unit and fuel cell business that have both recently announced new contracts or partnerships. That includes hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for GM Defense.",
      "Super Cruise",
      "Other than saving capital, GM\u2019s silver lining for canceling the Cruise robotaxi business was that it sees more promise in continuing to develop its\u00a0Super Cruise\u00a0hands-free advanced driver assistance system. That includes more semi-automated and, eventually, autonomous capabilities.",
      "GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016. However, it was an infamously slow ramp up until recently, when the automaker began rolling it out across its lineup. That started in 2021 and has continued to expand to more than 20 models, including high-volume vehicles such as its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.",
      "\u201cThe strategy shift demonstrates that GM continues to believe in the potential of AV technology for personal vehicles. Going forward, GM will focus on improving the capabilities of SuperCruise, which will be further enabled by ongoing technological advancements including in artificial intelligence (AI),\u201d BofA Securities\u2019 John Murphy said in a Wednesday investor note.",
      "On the other side of the coin, Murphy also points out that the move could imply that other companies such as Waymo and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0\u201chave better tech and/or that the market may not be appealing for later entrants.\u201d",
      "First-mover advantage lost",
      "GM wasn\u2019t expected to be a \u201clater entrant\u201d in\u00a0robotaxis. In fact, it was the\u00a0first to offer such rides\u00a0to the public, and many believed it was one of the leaders until last year, when the company grounded its driverless operations in October 2023 following a\u00a0crash involving a pedestrian\u00a0in San Francisco.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0fined Cruise $1.5 million\u00a0after the company failed to disclose details of the crash, which included a pedestrian being dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle.",
      "A third-party probe into the incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that\u00a0led to the accident. The probe also investigated allegations of a cover-up by Cruise leadership but found no evidence to support those claims.",
      "The report outlines multiple instances in which then-CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, who resigned from the company in November 2023, made the final calls to withhold information, specifically regarding media.",
      "Vogt was not enthusiastic about GM\u2019s decision to kill the robotaxi operations. He\u00a0posted on X\u00a0after the announcement, \u201cIn case it was unclear before, it is clear now: GM are a bunch of dummies.\u201d",
      "Vogt\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0pointed out GM\u2019s history of having a first-mover advantage with technology, as it did with Cruise and Super Cruise, and squandering it. GM had a similar path with EV tech, like the EV1 \u2014 a battery-electric vehicle produced in the 1990s \u2014 and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle in the 2010s, which were both abandoned by the company.",
      "GM follows several other companies in abandoning robotaxis, including its closest crosstown rival\u00a0Ford Motor, which shut down its\u00a0Argo AI autonomous vehicle unit\u00a0with Volkswagen in 2022.",
      "The robotaxi leader in the U.S. remains Waymo, which continues to expand operations for its publicly available fleet in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and will soon debut in Miami, Atlanta and Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cIn many ways this announcement highlights the economic challenges of scaling a robotaxi network and the role rideshare platforms can play as AVs attempt to commercialize (a bullish indicator), but we think the more tangible impact right now is on the partnership ecosystem given Waymo is already scaling despite the costs and Tesla has ambitions to do so as well,\u201d Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in an investor note last week."

    "story": [
      "Thirty-five years ago, the world was introduced to Harry Burns and Sally Albright, two bumbling New Yorkers who fall in and out of each other's lives before finding love 12 years after meeting.",
      "\"When Harry Met Sally...\" has since given pop culture memorable lines like \"I'll have what she's having,\" fashion touchstones like Harry's sweater and trends like \"Meg Ryan fall.\"",
      "Billy Crystal reflected on the film's endurance on Sunday TODAY, saying \"there\u2019s so much truth and love in that movie.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s so much romance in that movie. There\u2019s so much confusion in that movie about relationships that that\u2019s an eternal situation for people,\" he told Willie Geist for the Dec. 15 edition of \"Sunday Sitdown.\" \"And young kids now, they\u2019re into the phase of their life where they may be falling in love and, 'Is this the right thing?' It took Harry and Sally 12 years to figure it out, you know?\"",
      "The film's tagline notably posed a philosophical, even existential, question: \"Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?\"",
      "The question is explored both in the story's plot and its dialogue. After meeting via a carpool from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry and Sally bump into each other over the years before striking up a friendship. Whether or not their relationship can stay platonic becomes the driving force of the film.",
      "Harry argues, in one of their earliest run-ins, that men and women can't just be friends \"because the sex part always gets in the way.\" And at the risk of spoiling the 35-year-old film, he's seemingly proven right by the end.",
      "After Sally hears that her ex-boyfriend is getting married, she tearfully calls Harry. When he comes over to console her, the pair sleep together for the first time and find themselves on vastly different pages the next morning: Harry wants to go back to being friends, and Sally tries to end their friendship forever.",
      "In the movie's finale, Harry sprints in the snow to profess his love to Sally at a New Year's Eve party, a scene that some on X have recently said \"literally changed the trajectory\" of their lives.",
      "The movie's screenwriter, Nora Ephron, who died in 2012, said that the film wasn't about answering the question, \"Can men and women be friends?\" Instead, the movie is about the differences in how men and women view friendship, she wrote in the introduction to a 1990 printing of the script, per Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that men don\u2019t want to be friends with women. Men know they don\u2019t understand women, and they don\u2019t much care. They want women as lovers, as wives, as mothers, but they\u2019re really not interested in them as friends. They have friends,\" she said.",
      "\"Women, on the other hand, are dying to be friends with men. Women know they don\u2019t understand men, and it bothers them: they think that if only they could be friends with them, they would understand them,\" she added.",
      "But how would that question be answered now?",
      "We asked some of the most popular authors today for their take on the core question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends? Or, updated for 2024, can two people who are attracted to each other just be friends?",
      "Here's what they said.",
      "Emily Henry",
      "Emily Henry is the author of several romance novels, including \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which she's described as an homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Book Lovers,\" featuring a main character named Nora Stephens, after Ephron.",
      "\"People We Meet on Vacation,\" currently being adapted for a film starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, follows Poppy and Alex and their friendship from college to adulthood, sustained through annual vacations.",
      "On the question of whether two people attracted to each other can just be friends, Henry says, \"I actually do think so.\"",
      "\"I think Poppy and Alex could have stayed friends, they just had to make the decision,\" she says. \"You can't be half-in and half-out, you have to make the decision and really commit to it.",
      "\"For a lot of us, attraction comes and goes, but friendship is forever,\" she adds. \"I wonder what Nora would actually say because the movie, it's like they get together, but was she really saying they can't (be friends), or was she just saying these people belong to each other? I wish I could ask her.\"",
      "Yulin Kuang",
      "Speaking of the \"People We Meet on Vacation\" film adaptation, the screenplay for that project was written by Yulin Kuang. She's also set to direct the adaptation of Henry's \"Beach Read,\" and in April she published her debut romance novel, \"How to End a Love Story.\"",
      "Kuang says she's a huge \"When Harry Met Sally...\" fan.",
      "\"I have never lived in a world without it, which feels correct,\" she says.",
      "In fact, the writer had the \"When Harry Met Sally...\" screenplay printed out and kept it on her desk, \"so I could absorb its energy by osmosis.\"",
      "Looking back on it now, she gives a clear answer on the film's question.",
      "\"Can men and women be friends? Yes,\" she says. \"Can two people who are attracted to each other \u2014 that one gives me pause.\"",
      "\"Yes, but if I was very attracted to (a friend), I would have to do some unpacking about that in therapy,\" she adds. \"If it was getting to the point of, 'We're in crush territory,' I think that would be a little dangerous.\"",
      "As to how the film answers its own question, Kuang described it as a \"specific story,\" rather than a generalization. Because both characters feel relatable, like real people pulled from the world, it's understandable to view the movie as a commentary on men and women, she says.",
      "\"But ultimately, it's really just a commentary on Harry and Sally,\" she says.",
      "Kennedy Ryan",
      "Kennedy Ryan is the author of more than 20 books, including \"Reel\" and the upcoming conclusion to her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "Ryan says \"When Harry Met Sally...\" is an example of \"nailing the happily ever after\" with the New Year's Eve love confession and kiss.",
      "\"That's like, hall of fame happily ever after,\" she says.",
      "Like Henry and Kuang, she thinks people who are attracted to each other can stay friends \u2014 but \"it can be complicated.\"",
      "\"I say that just because I have several friends who are guys who I've known for years,\" she says. \"Now, I also have had friends who were guys who, it didn't work out that way, where you thought that it would be fine being platonic, and then one catches feelings for the other, and then it gets complicated, and you can get really hurt and lose friendships that way.\"",
      "She maintains it's possible with specific boundaries.",
      "\"I think it just comes down to being clear about what you both want and when things shift, being honest about that,\" she says.",
      "It also depends on if you find them attractive, or, if you're attracted to them.",
      "\"If you are attracted to someone, and I say this as a romance novelist \u2014 like, I live by this stuff \u2014 it's the draw, it's the pull, and that's something that, if it's strong enough, it's hard to ignore,\" she says. \"But also, if you are attracted to someone, you have to ask, why is this not a romantic relationship? And when you interrogate that, maybe it helps you deal with the attraction.\"",
      "Tia Williams",
      "Tia Williams is the author of the romance novel \"Seven Days In June\" and 2024's \"A Love Song for Ricki Wilde.\"",
      "Williams calls \"When Harry Met Sally...\" a comfort movie.",
      "She says she remembers seeing \"When Harry Met Sally...\" in theaters when she was 13 and was struck by the film's central question.",
      "\"Back then, friendship was \u2014 everything was defined in very restrictive terms and put in these very traditional buckets,\" she says. \"If you're friends, that's platonic. It means you're not having sex, and you never will.",
      "\"But I think that the idea of friendship has evolved. I mean, when we get to 'Sex and the City,' we have the idea of f--- buddies, and people that you aren't pursuing a relationship with that you're really just friends with, that you're also having sex with,\" she adds.",
      "She describes the film's essential question as, \"Can you platonically be friends with someone that you are attracted to?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you can,\" she says. \"I don't think there's any way to be platonic friends with someone that you desperately want to have sex with.\"",
      "She argues if one is attracted to a friend, the dynamic can no longer be described as platonic.",
      "While having the friendship between Harry and Sally inevitably turn into a relationship may seem \"puritanical\" \u2014 \"if you're attracted, you have to be lovers\" \u2014 Williams argues the film's depiction of romance  defied gender normative roles of men and women not understanding each other.",
      "\"It's showing there's friendship within a relationship,\" she says. \"In 'When Harry Met Sally...' they were actually friends for years, and then fell in love. Women are people. Men are people. We can have friendship, respect.\"",
      "But, \"they were never going to be just friends,\" she adds.",

      "Straub, who grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, describes \"When Harry Met Sally...\" as a \"tour of my childhood.\"",
      "\"I would love for every rom-com to be this smart and funny and let its characters read books. Harry is often reading books in this movie and that is meaningful to me. And they just have smart conversations,\" she says.",
      "She says \"of course\" men and women can be friends, and so can two people who are attracted to each other.",
      "\"I think if the circumstances had been different their friendship would have continued for the rest of their lives, quite happily,\" she says. \"I feel like it's a very boring answer, but I think yes.\"",
      "\"I feel like I have a lot of male friends, and so I believe that of course it's possible, even with someone as absolutely charming as Billy Crystal,\" she adds. \"I think I could absolutely just be friends with Billy Crystal.\"",
      "And while the film ends with Harry and Sally in a romantic relationship, she argues the film \"does actually prove that men and women can be friends \u2014 I'm willing to say it,\" she says.",
      "\"What I believe to be true is that romance is really about timing,\" she says. \"That's what you see in the movie. There are all of these misses in terms of timing for them, and then the timing is right. But it doesn't mean in the multiverse, in the Harry and Sally multiverse, that it always would be.\"",
      "Jasmine Guillory",
      "Jasmine Guillory, whose next book, \"Flirting Lessons,\" comes out in April 2025, is the author of nine romance books, including \"The Wedding Date.\"",
      "Guillory says \"absolutely\" people who are attracted to each other can be friends, because attraction isn't the only determining factor of whether or not a relationship can work.",
      "\"I'm attracted to so many people who I recognize that our relationship is perfect as it is, and I would never want to do anything to it,\" Guillory says.",
      "The film also shows that a person can be attracted to someone, but not meant for them \u2014 or at least, that version of them.",
      "\"Yes, (Harry and Sally) are meant for each other. But at the beginning of the movie, they aren't. And I think that happens in life, right?\" she says.",
      "\"There are people who you may have known 10 years ago who, if you had had a relationship then, it would be terrible, but now it's perfect,\" she says."

    "title": "Does Selena Gomez's engagement ring have a secret message? Why people think so",
    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 19:41:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Selena Gomez's engagement ring might be sparking a trend into marquise cut diamond rings. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",
      "Chaf\u00e9, like many internet commentators, is convinced the choice of ring stems from the song. \u201cIt must be something from there,\u201d she said.",
      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",
      "Some marquise cut-wearers are happy Gomez joined the club. A TikToker posted a video with the text, \"Now me and Selena have the same Marquise Diamond ring.\"",
      "Others are anticipating that Gomez's ring will spark a spike in popularity, making their unique rings not quite as special. One TikToker posted a video of her marquise ring with the text \"to my marquise girlies... it was nice while it lasted.\"",
      "Going forward, Chaf\u00e9 also expects the marquise cut to rise in popularity.",
      "\u201cAnything Selena Gomez does will spark a trend. Perhaps not in 2025, but in 2026, for sure, marquise will be a popular cut,\u201d she said."

      "A new movie about the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is sparking debate among viewers and religious scholars alike.",
      "\u201cMary,\u201d a Biblical epic streaming now on Netflix, tells the story of the Nativity through the eyes of Mary of Nazareth (Noa Cohen). The film follows Mary, Joseph (Ido Tako) and the newborn Jesus as they escape persecution from King Herod (Anthony Hopkins).",
      "\u201cMary is the most extraordinary woman ever to walk this earth, yet her story remains largely unknown beyond a few passages in the Bible,\u201d director D.J. Caruso told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "\u201cI embarked on this journey \u2014 to create a film that presents her in her most human and relatable form,\u201d he continued, adding that his aim was \u201cto portray Mary as someone we can all connect with, not just as a saint but as the young woman we all recognize before her sanctification.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe said her intention was to make Mary and Joseph\u2019s story \u201crelatable,\u201d speaking to\u00a0The Christian Post, and tell a story of a \u201cyoung girl becoming a woman in the midst of such divine expectations.\u201d",
      "While some viewers are praising the film, which has been in Netflix\u2019s Top 10 for much of the time since its debut on the streaming platform Dec. 6, others have objected to what they views as the movie\u2019s Biblical and historical inaccuracies. Others have objected to the casting.",
      "What religious scholars are saying about \u2018Mary\u2019",
      "Religious scholars have had mixed reactions to \u201cMary,\u201d as they debate perceived inaccuracies in the portrayal.",
      "Christy Cobb, a assistant professor of Christianity in the department of religious studies at the University of Denver, says the field of Biblical studies has been alight with discussions about the film. She first heard about \u201cMary\u201d through a post on Facebook \u2014 \u201ca rant post,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBiblical scholars are hearing about these movies, and then we get excited, and then when we watch it, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t depicting Biblical stories as accurately or historical moments as accurately as we hope that they would be,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d about Mary in the Bible, Cobb says. Aspects of Mary\u2019s character in the movie are based on passages of the New Testament (the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke) and an early Christian text called the Proto Gospel of James.",
      "Filmmakers took creative liberties with Mary's depiction, Cobb says. Cobb appreciated that the film's Mary is more \u201cfiery and rebellious\u201d than commonly depicted. \u201cI like that we\u2019re depicting Mary as this full character with some agency, courage and her fears at the surface,\u201d she says.",
      "But other historical inaccuracies stood out.",
      "The movie places modern conservative family values onto the Holy Family in a way that is \u201cnot supported by the text\u201d or by historical context, Cobb, who is working on a book about early Christian families, says.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Family was depicted (in the movie) as a nuclear family. Joseph is immediately supportive of Mary and will protect Mary at all costs,\u201d she says.",
      "The Bible, however, says that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary. Families also \u201clooked quite different\u201d in that era than they do today, Cobb says. Divorces were common and there would have been more people living in the household than depicted in \u201cMary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Bible, all sorts of families are represented, not just one view of a family system,\u201d she says.",
      "The result, Cobb says, is \u201cwe\u2019re having the the debate about what a Christian family (should) look like, superimposed upon this film.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe, speaking to Christian Post, said that script approval came from \u201ca range of religious leaders\u201d to \u201censure authenticity.\u201d",
      "However, only one person, Adam W. Schindler, is listed as a Biblical consultant on IMDB. Schindler is a pastor and the chief digital officer of the conservative nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute, founded by two former advisors to president Donald Trump. The movie is funded, in part, by megachurch pastor Joel Osteen, per IMDB.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Aloe Entertainment, Schindler and Caruso for comment about script consultants.",
      "Other aspects of the movie \u2014 including Mary\u2019s more down-to-earth characterization \u2014 are sparking debate for straying from doctrine.",
      "Some Catholic commentators have objected to the depiction of Mary\u2019s labor pains during the birth of Jesus, because showing Mary suffering during childbirth \u201cdoes not comport with Catholic teaching,\u201d Joseph Pronechen wrote in a review for the National Catholic Register.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Fathers and doctors of the Church, including Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, have taught that Mary alone would be exempt from such pains as a sign of her unique holiness,\u201d he sayss in his review. \u201cShe alone had no original sin.\u201d",
      "Caruso addressed his choice to show Mary in pain during labor in a recent interview with Christianity Today.",
      "\u201cRegarding the labor pains: That\u2019s about presenting Mary in a human way, acknowledging that she had apprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something like a third of women died in childbirth in antiquity.\u201d",
      "Nathanael Andrade, a chair and professor of history at Binghamton University, who has written a forthcoming book about the crucifixion of Jesus, also pointed out a \u201cserious problem\u201d for movies like \u201cMary\u201d and others that portray the life of Jesus.",

      "Why the casting of Mary also stirred up controversy",
      "\u201cMary\u201d ruffled feathers outside of the religious community. Some people have objected to the casting of Noa Cohen, a Jewish Israeli actor, as Mary. Several other actors in the movie, including Ido Tako, who plays Joseph, and Keren Tzur, who plays Elizabeth, are also Israeli.",
      "The real Mary was believed to be a Jewish woman from Nazareth, Galilee. At the time of Mary\u2019s birth, Galilee was a region in ancient Palestine. Today, it is located in northern Israel.",
      "Online, some viewers believe Mary should have been portrayed by an Arab Palestinian actor in the new movie, pointing to modern conflicts in the region. Others defended the casting of a Jewish actor to play Mary.",
      "Caruso spoke to the casting decision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201c It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum, Caruso said it was his \u201cgoal\u201d to find an actor \u201cfrom the region where Mary was born to play her.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could find a great young Jewish actress, that would be amazing,\u201d he told Netflix\u2019s Tudum.",

      "\u201cThe idea of the movie is to spread love, and art is hopefully a uniter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be something that separates anybody.\u201d"

      "When \"Carry-On\" begins, Ethan is your run-of-the-mill average TSA agent working on one of the busiest days of the year: Christmas Eve. By the end, Ethan's transforms into a John McClane-esque action hero ready to die defending those he loves, \"yippee-ki-yay\"-ing it up.",
      "\"It's like a '90s action-thriller,\" Taron Egerton said on TODAY. \"I read the script, and I just thought, 'That's a movie I want to see.' The buy-in is immediate. Guy gets an earwig on the busiest day of the year, puts it in his ear and they threaten his girlfriend. It's such a good set up for a movie.\"",
      "Through many twists and turns, Ethan is blackmailed into letting the bomb through security. Not ready to let innocent people die, he takes responsibility for handling the Traveler himself.",
      "Egerton unpacks the wild ending of the movie with TODAY.com, revealing his character's motivation and thoughts, below.",
      "What happens at the end of 'Carry-On'?",
      "After a tense and precarious battle in the airport between Ethan and the Traveler, the Traveler makes it onto the airplane, looming the death of everybody on board over Ethan.",
      "But Ethan isn't going to give up yet. He kicks into action and commandeers a belt loader, quickly steering it down the runway, chasing after the plane getting ready to take off.",
      "Egerton tells TODAY.com that this scene is the only part of the movie that he thinks, \"Oh my God, that's insane!\"",
      "Before that, Egerton feels Ethan has acted as best he can in a highly pressurized situation.",
      "\"I think that might be the moment when I'm like, 'Come on, mate! This is feeling a little bit out there now.' But everything within the airport, I think it's legit,\" he says. \"I think he's doing a good job of dealing with a very stressful set of circumstances.\"",
      "Police arrive as Ethan hoists himself into the airplane's cargo hold. Nora then convinces them that the safest way to save everyone is to put their faith in Ethan's ability to disarm the bomb mid-flight.",

      "The Traveler then grabs the bomb from the fridge, leaving its door wide open and begins to prepare his parachute.",
      "Ethan uses what could be his last conversation before his death to tell the Traveler that the real reason he flunked his polygraph and didn't make it into the police academy (which had been his dream) was because he lied to cover up a crime his dad committed.",
      "The Traveler says that ever since then, Ethan's been just like his dad, \"A loser, a waste, and asleep.\"",
      "\"That's kind of the theme for Ethan of the film, really,\" Egerton says. \"He's just found out he's gonna be a dad and it's time to wake up and be a grown up.\"",
      "He adds that the line also comes from the essence of the Traveler's character.",
      "\"I think it's the arrogance of Jason's character, thinking he's got it all figured out,\" he says. \"The character is totally unflappable, whereas Ethan is extremely flappable,\" leaving this moment as Ethan's chance to \"wake up.\"",
      "The Traveler opens the suitcase with the bomb in it, only to discover that one of the cylinders of the deadly nerve agent is missing. But before the Traveler can react, the camera pans to Ethan holding the cylinder as he says, \"I guess I woke up.\"",
      "Ethan lunges, shoving the Traveler into the open fridge and smashing the cylinder inside it with him.",
      "\"Jason has the upper hand for the entire movie,\" Egerton says. \"I'm like a rat in a trap for the whole thing, so it did feel quite good to finally get my own back and be the kind of winner at the end... it felt good to finally shove him in that fridge.\"",
      "Ethan barricades his body onto the door, trapping the Traveler inside as he fights to escape the dispersed nerve agent spreading throughout the air-tight fridge.",
      "\"I like to pretend that it's an industrial, super strength fridge that's intended for containing deadly nerve agents,\" Egerton jokes.",

      "\"I think there's that thing of pursuing your dreams and things not being too late,\" Egerton says. \"And that's a nice thing to think about Christmas, I suppose.\"",
      "What's in store for Ethan and Nora in the future?",
      "Since the beginning of the film, Nora has been pregnant with Ethan's baby.",
      "While the flash forward shows the couple happy and flying to Tahiti with their child, one can't see if there's a ring on Nora's finger or not.",
      "\"I think they are very settled,\" Egerton says. \"I think they probably would get married and do the whole 2.5 kids thing.\"",
      "He also praises co-star Sofia Carson, saying he \"really loved working with her.\"",
      "\"She's such a lovely person and brilliant actress,\" he says. \"If there ever was a sequel... it'd be interesting to see what she's up to.\"",
      "Will there be a 'Carry-On' sequel?",
      "Egerton says that if people want a sequel \"it would be a really interesting conversation,\" adding he would \"be open to\" it.",
      "\"It's kind of like an extraordinary set of circumstances, so I think it would need a really innovative, creative idea to feel like a worthy idea for a sequel,\" he says. \"But yeah, why not.\"",
      "Egerton adds that sequels \"work for 'Die Hard,' so who knows?\"",
      "Additionally, to add to the long-heated debate, he says that he \"100 percent\" considers \"Die Hard\" to be a Christmas movie, noting that it's one of his favorite films.",
      "Egerton also says that \"Carry-On,\" which holds similar connections to \"Die Hard,\" can \"absolutely\" be a Christmas movie.",
      "\"When I watched it, it made me feel super Christmassy,\" he says. \"So that's my metric. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.\""

    "story": [
      "Jonathan Bailey is reflecting on his sexuality and how its evolved over time.",
      "In an interview with British Vogue published on Dec. 12, Bailey talked about exploring his sexuality in his early 20s. The \"Wicked\" actor recalled dating a girl for a couple of years, but during that same era, he also came out as gay to his family and some close friends, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting with the binary, where you\u2019re perceived to be either this or that,\" Bailey said in the interview. \"That\u2019s how I saw it at the time, but there are so many nuances to it. My experience of that relationship was not that I was in the shadows. She remains one of my best friends.\u201d",
      "The \"Bridgerton\" star believes that even before he was \"aware\" of his own sexuality, others picked up on it. He recalled his parents support when he wanted to pursue ballet at a young age.",
      "\u201cI remember looking through the window at these girls at school in their tutus,\" he said. They were doing, like, first position, second position, and I knew I just wanted to be in there.\u201d",
      "But not all of Bailey's childhood memories are positive. He remembered a time when he was struggling with schoolwork, and his teacher called him out in front of the entire class, saying, \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t so busy being a fairy you\u2019d understand.\u201d",

      "\"I reached a point where I thought, f--- this, I\u2019d much prefer to hold my boyfriend\u2019s hand in public or be able to put my own face picture on Tinder and not be so concerned about that than getting a part.\"",
      "Bailey is aware that there is much more work to be done when it comes to protecting LGBTQ+ rights and the community's youth, as seen through his own experience.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a confident hand-holder in relationships,\u201d he explained to in his British Vogue profile. \u201cI had a boyfriend who wasn\u2019t experienced at holding hands in public. We got heckled in London. But that kind of behaviour is now outweighed by the smiles you get.\u201d",
      "Bailey didn't disclose to British Vogue whether he's in a relationship currently, but he was open to talking about wanting to have children. However, he believes now is not the right time for him.",
      "\"I want to make sure I\u2019m going to be present. I\u2019m reading books on adoption. I might coparent with a woman, but I\u2019m thinking it will be with a man,\" Bailey said."

      "Letting go of your family home is hard \u2014 but when the house still holds potentially explosive secrets, it becomes a lot harder.",
      "Such is the case in the new Netflix show \u201cNo Good Deed,\u201d starring sitcom legends Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe on \u201cFriends,\u201d and Ray Romano, who played Raymond on \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond.\u201d",
      "Liz Feldman's first show since \"Dead to Me,\" the dark comedy chronicles Lydia (Kudrow) and Paul (Romano) Morgan, a long-time married couple who are looking to sell the gorgeous Los Angeles home that they raised their two children in.",
      "\u201cThis show is inspired by my search for a house,\u201d Feldman tells TODAY.com. \u201cI started thinking of the idea during the pandemic, when we were all locked down, when suddenly our homes became our everything. At night, I would search on Zillow and just like, look at houses and fantasize about being anywhere other than this place that I was just constantly in. That was sort of the original inspiration.\u201d",
      "As she started looking at homes, she said the process inherently involved drama. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody selling that house for a reason, and not always a good one. And I just thought it was really good fodder for a show,\u201d she says.",
      "Indeed, in the show, the Morgans\u2019\u00a0 home is visited by prying neighbors and competitive buyers who are eager to know everything about the home \u2014 especially details of the fatal break-in that happened three years prior.",

      "Who killed Jacob? The break-in at the Morgan home, explained",
      "The first twist: The break-in wasn\u2019t actually a break in at all \u2014 it was Lydia and Paul\u2019s son, Jacob (Wyatt Aubrey), trying to get inside.",
      "When Jacob starting banging on the door and windows, his sister Emily (Chloe East) thought it was a break-in. Understandably so: Her brother was in a burglar uniform. He had taken to robbing other people's houses.",
      "Fearing for her life, she reached for the family\u2019s gun. For three years, Emily thought she killed her brother. The guilt and regret tore her family apart, leading to estrangement from her parents.",
      "Then comes the second twist, which is revealed in the finale. The bullet that shot Jacob wasn't from Emily's gun \u2014 instead, it was from a gun that belongs to the Morgans' neighbor Margo Starling (Linda Cardellini).",
      "Turns out Margo and Jacob were likely having an affair, though Margo denies it). In the present day, Lydia confronted Margo, who said Jacob only had a \"crush.\"",
      "But it's likely their ties went deeper, given how desperate Margo was to keep Jacob silent. Plus, Jacob said they were \"in bed\" the week before their final fight.",
      "Jacob had taken to stealing from the neighbors\u2019 houses and gave his stolen luxuries to Margo. The night he died, he raided Margo's drawers and took everything home.",
      "As he left, Margo took her husband\u2019s gun and trailed him home, threatening him if he spoke out. She fired as he tried to get into the house.",
      "Meanwhile, his sister also fired her gun \u2014 understandable, considering Jacob was wearing his burglar outfit. Since the family had kept the autopsy sealed, they never knew the truth.",
      "Who buys the Morgans' home?",
      "Leslie (Abbi Jacobson) and Sarah (Poppy Liu) walk away as the victors \u2014 and it was all thanks to a little bit of manipulation.",
      "Dennis (O-T Fagbenle) and Carla (Teyonah Parris) were also after the house and actually had their offer accepted. When Carla was giving birth, her doctor \u2014 who happened to be Sarah, due to a last minute change \u2014\u00a0filled her in on the Morgan home\u2019s gruesome history. Carla decided she wants a different house.",
      "When the series ends, Sarah is pregnant and a new family has officially taken over the Morgan home.",
      "Do Lydia and Paul stay together?",
      "The end of the show sees them reconnecting as a couple and finally working through the distance that plagued them since Jacob's death.",
      "By the end of the episode, they\u2019ve also reconciled with their daughter. Her parents sit in the audience as she sings a song about healing. Meanwhile, a light flickers \u2014 a sign from their son.",
      "Kudrow and Romano, who have both been in decades-long marriages, say they drew on their own relationships for the role.",
      "\u201cI think being in a long term marriage is sort of at the core of this couple, and there are ups and downs in there and periods where you\u2019re not communicating well,\u201d Kudros says.",
      "Romano says being married and having children made this role easy to tap into.",
      "\u201cI drew on how, if this was really happening, what would it do to me?\u201d he says.",
      "What happens to the other characters?",
      "Carla and Dennis find a home, but it's not the Morgans'. They are preparing to build a house on Margo and JD Campbell's property after their original house burned down.",
      "Carla and Dennis' future is complicated, too. Dennis used the gift that Carla\u2019s billionaire father sent them upon the birth of their baby. Carla, who doesn\u2019t want to do with her father, isn\u2019t aware and thinks he got the money from his third book advance \u2014\u00a0tension, perhaps, for a potential Season 2 to explore.",
      "As for Margo and JD? They're split up \u2014 and one might be headed to jail. In her last appearance, Margo, scarred from the fire, gets arrested. JD, meanwhile, is thriving and has a job on a Western.",
      "Cardellini, speaking to TODAY.com, relishes the \"micro twists\" that happen on Feldman's shows (she also starred in \"Dead to Me\").",
      "\u201cEvery time you read the script, there are all these sort of micro twists that happen to you and to other characters that are part of the peeling of all the layers \u2014\u00a0and onion of layers of people\u2019s personalities and secrets,\" she says."

      "At Hmeimim, two An-124 heavy transport aircraft were observed on the airfield with their nose cones raised, ready to load equipment. Nearby, a Ka-52 attack helicopter was seen being dismantled, likely in preparation for transport.",
      "Other forces, including Russian military convoys, appear to be heading toward the airbase.",
      "Footage verified by NBC News captured a Russian convoy traveling north toward Homs along the highway connecting Damascus in the south to Aleppo in the north. \u201cMay God never return you,\u201d the person filming the video says, noting it was the second such convoy he had seen.",
      "Another video shows Russian military vehicles driving in Jableh, near Hmeimim airbase.",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, also reported that Russian forces were withdrawing from the Hassia area south of Homs, with plans to regroup later at Hmeimim.",
      "Similar movements of Russian forces on the move have been observed across the country.",
      "Another verified video showed Russian military vehicles driving through what appears to be Syria as bystanders waved their shoes at the cars. A separate video, posted by the prominent Russian military-themed Telegram channel\u00a0\"Military Informer,\" purportedly showed a Russian military column crossing through Kurdish-controlled territories in Syria.",
      "The fall of Assad has dealt a significant blow to Russia, which is already engaged in a protracted land war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s military presence in Syria has been central to its strategy in the Middle East, with Hmeimim and Tartus serving as critical hubs for projecting power across the region and safeguarding Moscow\u2019s influence in the Mediterranean.",
      "When Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War in 2015, its support shifted the balance decisively in Assad\u2019s favor, but Moscow has not prevented his downfall this time, and\u00a0any significant withdrawal from the country would mark a major blow.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down the damage last week, saying that while Russia had expended significant effort in stabilizing Syria in the past, its current priority lies with the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "He said that Moscow is now in discussions with the new Syrian leadership to address issues related to its military presence and the security of Russian citizens and diplomats in the country.",
      "\u201cYou know, of course, that we are in contact with those who are currently in control of the situation in Syria,\u201d Peskov told reporters, as translated by Reuters.",
      "In a notable shift, Russian state media has begun referring to the Syrian rebels as \u201crebels\u201d rather than \u201cterrorists,\u201d signaling Moscow\u2019s intention to engage diplomatically with the new authorities in Syria as it seeks to maintain its strategic military foothold on the Mediterranean.",
      "However, there is no indication that a specific agreement has been reached to secure Russia\u2019s continued presence.",
      "Meanwhile, Syria\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations sent two identical letters to the U.N. and the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, containing an official complaint after Israeli forces moved into Syrian territory last week, while launching a massive wave of airstrikes into the country.",
      "\u201cSyria renews its demand that the United Nations and the Security Council assume their responsibilities and take firm and immediate measures to compel Israel to immediately cease its ongoing attacks on Syrian territory, ensure that they are not repeated, withdraw immediately from the areas into which it has penetrated over the past days,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said last week that he had ordered the military to establish a \u201csterile defense zone\u201d in southern Syria as Israeli forces seize control of the demilitarized, U.N.-patrolled buffer zone, established under a 1974 ceasefire agreement.",
      "Israel says its airstrikes and actions on the ground are aimed at preventing Assad\u2019s arsenal of rockets and chemical weapons from falling into the hands of extremists who could threaten its borders or people.",
      "But its advance has raised alarm when the international community is already nervous about further instability as Syria navigates its transition away from 53 years of Assad rule."

      "When NBC News gained access to the squat, modernist palace perched in the mountains above the capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, it was relatively calm, despite the appearance of having been robbed. Fighters from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, which led the rebel overthrow, stood guard, checking cars in a bid to put a stop to any more thefts from the building that was Assad\u2019s main residence until he was forced into exile.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Changes to Iraq\u2019s Personal Status Law could allow girls as young as nine to get married.",
    "story": [
      "BAGHDAD \u2014 She was just 11 when she was sold into wedlock with a man 36 years her senior. In the nine years since, she said, she has been raped, beaten, divorced and returned to her family, who hid her away out of shame and forced her into servitude.",
      "Today she is a sex worker in the Iraqi city of Erbil, having moved there recently from the capital, Baghdad.",
      "Batta said her husband raped her on their wedding night and regularly beat her before he sent her back to her family three years after they were married. Instead of offering sympathy, they treated her as a pariah, she said. NBC News does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault, and it agreed not to use her real name and to use only the first names of her parents.",
      "Now she fears other young girls will be subjected to similar ordeals if lawmakers pass proposed amendments to Iraq\u2019s Personal Status Law that could allow marriage for girls as young as 9, as well as give religious authorities the power to decide on family affairs including marriage, divorce and the care of children.",
      "\u201cChanging the law will give parents the right to sell their young daughters,\u201d Batta said in a telephone interview last month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call it marriage, because when a girl gets married at the age of 9 or 10, it means her family has sold her. It also allows men to exploit the poverty that many Iraqi families are experiencing.\u201d",
      "\u2018She\u2019s still a little girl\u2019",
      "Batta said that a few months after her father, Hussein, told her they were pulling her out of the fourth grade because they could not afford to send her to school, she overheard an argument between her parents.",
      "She said her mother, Hana\u2019a, 55, was shouting at him, saying: \u201cShe is still a little girl. Don\u2019t you fear God? She is still playing with children; how can she bear the responsibility of being a wife? She doesn\u2019t even know how to cook any food; she doesn\u2019t even know how to fry an egg.\u201d",
      "Her father replied that the man who was going to marry her was \u201ca respectable man.\u201d",
      "\u201cYes, he is older than her, but he will treat her well and won\u2019t make her cook. The man just wants to get married,\u201d Batta said she heard him say, before he added, \u201cShe will marry whether you accept or not.\u201d",
      "Batta said she \u201chad just turned 11 when my father asked me to take a shower and wear nice clothes.\u201d Afterward, she said, he took her to a gathering of a group of men, including a cleric. \u201cI later learned that one of them was the man who would be my husband, while the other two were witnesses to the marriage,\u201d she said.",
      "Later, she said, she learned that her father had received 15 million Iraqi dinars, or around $11,300, from the man, part of which he used to buy a new taxi. \u201cI also learned that my husband was 47 years old,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cOn the first night, the night I lost my virginity, I didn\u2019t know what this man was doing. I felt immense pain, and I cried as he knelt over me without being able to move my hands or feet,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to forget this day, even though I will never forget it.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, Batta said, her husband \u201ctreated me well\u201d for the first year of their marriage, but after a year \u201chis behavior towards me changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe started hitting me for anything I did, even if I was just watching television; he would hit me and say that I had no right to watch TV,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ceven servants were treated better than I was.\u201d",
      "When her father died of cirrhosis two years after their wedding, she said, her husband would not allow her to attend the funeral.",
      "Batta said that in July 2016, when she was just 14, he took her to the cleric who married them. Afterward, she said, he took her back to her family home and told her mother, \u201cThis is your daughter, and this is her divorce paper.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mother never let me leave the house because she felt ashamed of what the neighbors would think,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my siblings didn\u2019t treat me well. I became like a servant in the house, having to serve everyone.\u201d",
      "At 16, she said, she decided to run away from home and go to Baghdad. There, she said, she met a woman on social media who offered her a place to stay \u201conly to find out that she ran a brothel.\u201d",
      "\u201cI work for her now,\u201d she said. \u201cI go with the other girls to one of the nightclubs, dancing in front of everyone and seducing men to get as much money as I can from them.\u201d",
      "At the end of each month, she said, the woman \u201cdistributes a quarter of the total amount we managed to obtain over the entire month, while the rest is considered rent and food money.\u201d",
      "\u2018Blatant violation of children\u2019s rights\u2019",
      "Batta is by far not the only child in Iraq to have been married at a young age.",
      "UNICEF reported in April 2023 that 28% of girls are married before the legal age of 18, although under Iraqi law, girls as young as 15 can be married with the consent of judges and their parents.",
      "The potential consequences of child marriage were laid bare in a 2016 report by the United Nations Population Fund on the effects of child marriage in Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdistan region, which said it \u201cusually comes with unhealthy and ill-informed sexual relations that may include unwanted and forced sex, domestic rape, vulnerability to domestic violence and genderbased violence and adultery.\u201d",
      "That ultimately affects \u201cthe physical and mental well-being of child spouses,\u201d the report said.",
      "But lawmakers, predominantly from the Shia Muslim bloc, including the political parties Hikma, State of Law and Hukok, are nonetheless championing amendments to the Personal Status Law, also known as Law 188, suggesting they are in line with both Iraq\u2019s Constitution and Islamic law. Iraq is predominantly Shia; around 40% of the population is Sunni Muslim.",
      "Adopted in 1959, the current law unifies all segments of society under a single code while enshrining the rights of women and children. As well as setting the age of marriage, it addressed child custody, inheritances and alimony payments focused on the welfare of both children and women.",
      "The law \u201cwas one of the most progressive in the Middle East,\u201d according to Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank. It had survived \u201cregime changes, wars, civil wars and conflicts throughout many, many decades,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly proposed amendments would take a large amount of decision-making power away from both families and the courts and place it into the hands of clerics, some of whom set the age of puberty at 9.",
      "As a result, some lawmakers and rights groups are concerned that that would pave the way for legalizing and expanding child marriage in the country.",
      "The parties proposing the changes \u201ccame in promising democracy and a better future for Iraqis,\u201d Mansour said. But they failed to keep these promises, leading to increasing \u201cdisillusionment across the public\u201d and widespread protests calling for better services, increased job opportunities and an end to corruption, he said.",
      "\u201cThe ways in which they tried to gain legitimacy have waned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so this is an attempt by some of them to reassert that they are indeed religious parties and their legitimacy is based around religion.\u201d",
      "Three lawmakers who supported the proposed changes declined to be interviewed.",
      "Some of those pushing for the changes have suggested that they could help lower divorce rates and boost family values.",
      "Speaking to Iraqi broadcaster Al-Forat News in September, lawmaker Dunya Al-Shammari said they would protect \u201cwomen and families from disintegration, and resorting to Islamic law is the best guarantor to preserve these rights.\u201d She added that it would help to \u201cachieve justice between men and women regarding child custody.\u201d",
      "Others, like fellow Shia lawmaker Alya Nassif, called for the proposals to be voted down, as similar amendments were in 2014 and 2017. Calling the proposals \u201cdangerous,\u201d Nassif said the law \u201cthreatens society and families.\u201d She said members of parliament had been presented with \u201ca collection of ideas written on two sheets of paper,\u201d rather than \u201clegal articles that are needed to be discussed for voting.\u201d",
      "Calling the proposed amendments a \u201cblatant violation of children\u2019s rights,\u201d Kurdo Omar, an MP who represents the Kurdistan Alliance, said she thought it would harm Iraq\u2019s \u201creputation both domestically and internationally.\u201d",
      "Both joined a lawmaker boycott of a second reading of the draft bill in early September, which prevented it from taking place, and both hope to scupper the amendments entirely.",
      "Batta hopes they succeed.",
      "\u201cChanging the law will lead many underage girls to face circumstances similar to what I went through,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI am sure that those who are trying to change the law do not allow their daughters to marry at a young age because they do not need the money. The issue is solely about money and nothing else.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean lawmakers voted Saturday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed attempt to impose martial law, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos.",
      "The vote was 204 in favor and 85 against, with three abstentions and eight votes ruled invalid. All 300 lawmakers in the unicameral National Assembly voted on the motion, which required a two-thirds majority to pass.",
      "\u201cDear people, now go and enjoy the year-end parties,\u201d Woo Won-sik, the speaker of the National Assembly, said after the motion passed.",
      "The motion held that Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law was unconstitutional and illegal because there were no signs of national emergency and because he neglected to follow procedural rules such as notifying the National Assembly in advance.",
      "Supporters of the motion included members of Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party (PPP), whose boycott of an earlier impeachment vote had caused it to fail. Though the opposition controls parliament, it holds only 192 seats and needed support from at least eight PPP lawmakers to impeach Yoon.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader for the main opposition Democratic Party, said the vote was \u201ca triumph for the people and democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation of people involved with the martial law.\u201d",
      "Yoon was immediately suspended from state duties after the vote, with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo serving as acting president.",
      "\u201cI will do my best in the stable governance of our country,\u201d Han told reporters after the vote.",
      "Han could also face impeachment over his alleged role in the martial law declaration.",
      "The presidential office confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that Yoon was in the presidential residence, where he will remain until a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which has six months to decide whether to uphold the impeachment motion.",
      "There have been widespread calls for Yoon to step down since he declared emergency martial law last week. The short-lived order, which Yoon lifted within hours after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it, banned all political activity and censored the news media.",
      "Yoon, 63, who was once the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, is barred from traveling overseas\u00a0as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges.\u00a0Police tried unsuccessfully Wednesday to raid his office, where security officials blocked them.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his agenda in the opposition-controlled parliament, and the martial law declaration has only further eroded his public support. A Gallup Korea poll released Friday showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating at a record low of 11%, the Yonhap news agency reported, down from 13% a week earlier.",
      "Support for Yoon\u2019s impeachment had grown even within his conservative PPP.",
      "\u201cAll we all have to think of today is our country, South Korea, and the people of South Korea,\u201d PPP leader Han Dong-hoon told reporters before lawmakers gathered for the vote.",

      "Supporters of the protesters, many of whom carried K-pop light sticks, preordered food for them. K-pop singer-songwriter IU said she was providing 200 pieces of bread, 100 rice cakes, 200 bowls of rice soup and oxtail soup and 200 drinks\u00a0so rallygoers could \u201cwarm up a little bit.\u201d",
      "A website helped protesters keep track of where they could find bathrooms, as well as free food and drinks, while a bus was provided for parents needing a place to change their children\u2019s diapers.",
      "Others rallied in support of Yoon, with pro-Yoon protester Lee Gang-san saying almost a million people were at his event. NBC News was not able to independently verify that figure.",
      "\u201cWe fear that if President Yoon is impeached, the opposition will gain more power,\u201d he said by phone.",

      "A number of people have already been arrested in connection with the martial law declaration, including former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, the commissioner of the National Police Agency and the chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized twice for the \u201canxiety\u201d his order caused the public, he vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in a defiant speech Thursday in which he accused the opposition of paralyzing the government to the point that he felt declaring martial law was his only choice.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, said Friday that Yoon\u2019s speech was \u201ca declaration of war against the people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States and China have renewed a decades-old agreement on science and technology cooperation, officials from both countries said Friday, narrowing its scope and adding safeguards to address concerns about national security risks.",
      "The Science and Technology Agreement, originally signed in 1979, was the first accord between the two countries after they normalized diplomatic relations. It had historically been renewed roughly every five years, but U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns in about it recent years as China becomes a growing technological rival.",
      "The agreement, which was up for renewal in 2023, received two six-month extensions before lapsing on Aug. 27 of this year, and its continuation had been under negotiation for months.",
      "The State Department said Friday that the \u201cmodernized and strengthened\u201d agreement had been extended for five years. It said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails for protecting the safety and security of researchers, and \u201cadvances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.\u201d",
      "The agreement covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said.",
      "The Biden administration has imposed export controls on advanced semiconductor chips and restricted investment in other strategically sensitive fields in China such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, citing concerns that such technologies could aid China\u2019s military modernization.",
      "The renewal of the agreement was also confirmed in a short statement Friday by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, which did not provide details.",
      "Supporters of the pact argued that failure to renew it would not only imperil government-to-government collaboration in vital areas such as\u00a0climate change\u00a0and public health, but also inhibit academic cooperation between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Science and technology cooperation has already been chilled by the China Initiative, a Trump-era national security program meant to counter intellectual property theft at universities and research institutions. The program, which has prompted multiple prominent Chinese researchers to leave the U.S., ended in 2022 after a string of failed prosecutions.",
      "Asian American advocacy groups said ethnic Chinese scientists were unfairly targeted by the program, which House lawmakers are seeking to revive."

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security team has held discussions with the White House and Ukrainian leaders as part of a concerted effort to find a way to end the war with Russia, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "Trump's advisers and Cabinet nominees, who hold a range of views on Ukraine, have yet to present a conceptual or specific peace plan to Kyiv, the sources said.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to end the conflict even before he is inaugurated next month, calling the casualties suffered on both sides \u201ca tragedy.\u201d But he has sent mixed signals in his public comments, urging Russia to make peace but also suggesting he might scale back U.S. military aid to Ukraine or reimpose limits on Kyiv\u2019s use of American-made long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s promises to end the war quickly, it remains unclear whether he can persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the fighting as Moscow\u2019s forces gain ground in eastern Ukraine. It is also not clear if Trump's team has communicated with Putin\u2019s government about Ukraine, and if so, what has been conveyed by either side.",
      "When asked on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d if he were actively working to end the war, Trump said, \u201cI am,  but he declined to say if he had spoken to Putin since the November election.",

Mike Waltz, R-Fla., whom Trump has tapped to take over the position, a senior administration official and other sources familiar with the matter said.\u00a0They have focused on sharing relevant information, but have not explored strategies for ending the war or securing a ceasefire, one of the sources said.",
      "A benefit of those discussions is that they will ensure Trump\u2019s transition team will not be surprised by any Biden administration actions on Ukraine before the president-elect is inaugurated in January, the senior administration official said.",
      "\u201cTrump is really serious about wanting to get to a ceasefire on day one,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Trump\u2019s team is pushing hard to bring about a pause in fighting that would open the way for peace talks., but the challenges remain daunting as the war approaches the three-year mark.",
      "Asked if Walz and others on Trump's transition team are working with the Biden administration on a ceasefire plan, transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said: \u201cCongressman Waltz and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan are in contact on many issues. The goal is for the world to understand there is a desire for the time of transition to be seen as a strong America, working for peace and stability around the world, until President-Elect Trump is sworn in.\u201d",
      "Trump's team has not yet informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government about any potential plans, according to two sources close to Kyiv and former U.S. officials who are in communication with Ukrainian officials.\u00a0But recent meetings and conversations between Zelenskyy, Trump and their advisers have been constructive, including a face-to-face meeting in Paris brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron, the sources said.",

      "When Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, held talks last week with Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance joined the meeting.",
      "Ukraine and its supporters in Washington and Europe had worried that Trump would return to the White House with the view that Kyiv was the main barrier to ending the war. But the president-elect\u2019s social media posts suggest he views Putin and not Ukraine as the problem, the two sources and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Trump himself understands that the Ukrainians are not the obstacle to peace,\u201d a source said.",
      "On Sunday, Trump wrote on social media that Zelenskyy and Ukraine were ready for a peace deal and it was time for Putin \u201cto act.\u201d",
      "But there are \u201czero indications\u201d Putin is ready to make concessions or that his overall objective of having effective control of Ukraine has changed, John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said.",
      "The momentum has been shifting in Russia\u2019s favor on the battlefield in the east in recent weeks as Ukraine struggles with a manpower shortage, and as a result, the Kremlin will be reluctant to halt fighting, analysts and former U.S. diplomats say. Also, Russia would be unwilling to accept a ceasefire while Ukrainian troops continue to hold territory inside Russia in the Kursk region.",
      "A Russian hardliner with close ties to the Kremlin said in recent interviews that any attempt by Trump to end the war will be doomed unless there are broader talks that address Moscow\u2019s security concerns. Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon and ultra-nationalist, told the Financial Times that Putin was likely to reject a peace proposal floated months ago by Kellogg, before he was chosen by Trump to work as U.S. envoy to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cKellogg comes to Moscow with his plan, we take it and then tell him to screw himself, because we don\u2019t like any of it. That\u2019d be the whole negotiation,\u201d Malofeyev said.\u00a0\u201cFor the talks to be constructive, we need to talk not about the future of Ukraine, but the future of Europe and the world.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Kellogg proposed pressing both sides into peace talks by threatening to cut off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations and to ramp up weapons deliveries to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table. The plan would rule out Ukraine joining the NATO alliance for up to 10 years.",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would have to accept the current front lines, at least for now, and could regain lost territory only through diplomatic or political means.",
      "Trump\u2019s team will likely reject Ukraine\u2019s long-held goal of eventually joining the NATO alliance as a way to try to persuade Russia to enter into peace talks with Kyiv, sources with knowledge of the matter said.\u00a0Instead, Ukraine might be offered security guarantees by some alliance members. Zelenskyy has proposed the idea of foreign troops being deployed in the country until Kyiv could join the NATO alliance.",
      "The Trump transition team declined to comment on how Trump views the idea of barring Ukraine from joining NATO indefinitely or for some designated period of time.",
      "Earlier this year, Biden officials weighed whether to launch an effort to press the transatlantic alliance to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join. But the idea was discarded after Trump won the election in November, a source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "The Biden administration official said it would be a grievous mistake for Trump to push for a peace deal that would bar Ukraine from becoming part of NATO for the foreseeable future. That would amount to a great achievement for Putin \u2014 advancing his strategic interests by preventing Ukraine from becoming part of the West's military bulwark against Moscow \u2014 and nearly justify his invasion of Ukraine, the official said."

      "Pressure from President-elect Donald Trump was a major factor in Hamas relenting on two key issues during cease-fire and hostage-release talks with Israel, a senior administration official told NBC News on Friday.",
      "New hope for an agreement had senior Biden administration officials fanning out across the Middle East this week with the goal of closing on a critical pact by the end of 2024.",
      "According to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, Hamas has now agreed to Israeli forces staying in the Gaza Strip temporarily after fighting ends and to provide a complete list of hostages, including Americans, who will be released. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the concessions Hamas was prepared to make.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when the president [Joe Biden] presented his proposal,\u201d the Biden administration official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump's warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "Not everybody shared this optimism.",
      "\u201cWe are not there yet,\u201d another U.S. official warned.",
      "Negotiators were \u201ccloser\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019ve been close before so I\u2019m very cautious.\u201d",
      "The Oval Office has only one occupant at a time and Trump won't take over until Jan. 20, but Biden has appeared deferential to letting his successor get involved in negotiations and has not pushed back on his efforts to be engaged in talks.",
      "Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political wing, told NBC News that he was not aware that the group had recently made concessions during negotiations.",
      "This month, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \u201cEverybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire world, in the Middle East \u2014 but it\u2019s all talk, and no action!\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity,\u201d he added.",
      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior administration official said.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday that the Biden administration has had \u201cvery good consultation and coordination,\u201d with the incoming Trump team.",
      "\u201cWe talk to them about how we can send a common message that the United States, no matter who\u2019s sitting in the Oval Office, no matter whose party is in charge, wants to see this ceasefire and hostage deal and see it now, that is all part of the American contribution to an effort to ultimately produce an outcome here,\u201d Sullivan said, speaking from Tel Aviv. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to keep working until we get it done.\u201d",
      "The latest cease-fire proposal stems from U.S. proposals earlier this year, an Israeli official told NBC News. Both leaders of the Shin Bet internal security agency and Mossad traveled to Cairo in recent weeks to discuss the potential agreement.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure the agreement before the end of the month, Sullivan said Thursday at a news conference in Tel Aviv. Sullivan met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha on Friday and will then travel to Cairo for further discussions on the deal.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has traveled to the Middle East more than 10 times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, did not give a timeline.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that it [a ceasefire] is possible,\u201d Blinken said Friday after meeting with his Turkish counterpart. Blinken will discuss the next steps for a future Gaza with his Arab counterparts in Aqaba, Jordan, on Saturday.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack have languished for months. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the attack.",
      "Nearly 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have died in Gaza in the war that followed the attack, according to health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Cockroaches crawled out of the walls near a dirty, stained sink in the Syrian prison cell where an ex-prisoner told NBC News that American journalist Austin Tice was once held.",
      "Sahar al-Ahmad said he was in the cell across from Tice and last saw him alive in July 2022.",
      "\u201cI saw him twice. On one occasion I stole a glance while he was walking and exercising,\u201d Ahmad said in an interview Thursday, adding that he never spoke with Tice.",
      "Ahmad, who was able to provide an accurate description of the prison down to the number of steps leading to the area where he was detained, said that he had once been punished \u201cfor four hours because I violated the instructions and looked at a detainee.\u201d",
      "NBC News cannot independently verify his account the treatment he suffered.",
      "Tens of thousands of Syrians were believed to be in the country\u2019s vast prison system under the Assads. Relatives rushed to jails, military installations and even black sites to search for detained loved ones as soon as the regime fell.",
      "Now under the control of Syria\u2019s new rebel coalition, there were clear signs that the prison that held Ahmad had been abandoned in a hurry.\u00a0The coalition is\u00a0led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which gained control of the facility shortly after it overthrew the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last weekend.",
      "In the prison, which had been run by Syria\u2019s feared General Intelligence Directorate, blindfolds hung from the walls and lights were still flickering. In one cell, olives and flat bread, still fresh, were evidence of someone's last meal before the Assads' 50-year rule ended.",
      "On the walls, NBC News observed inscriptions in Arabic, Turkish English and Russian, as well as a calendar counting down days and pictures, all drawn in charcoal, in the dark, grim cell, perhaps to remind those held inside of life outside of the compound in the Syrian capital\u2019s Kafr Sousa district.",
      "In other cells nearby, there were doodles and drawings of soccer team badges. Some featured drawings of social media company logos like Snapchat, as well as pictures of cellphones. One prisoner had produced a panoramic view of Turkey's capital, Istanbul.",
      "Each cell had a large, metal door with a barred window at the top and a slot at bottom to slide food through. Some had blankets left behind by the now freed prisoners.",
      "There would have been no privacy. Cameras were dotted all over the facility, inside and outside the cells. Some appeared to be still working because small lights could be seen flashing on them.",
      "Those held in solitary confinement lived in cells no bigger than a closet.",
      "Tice's cell was designed for two, but is unclear if he was held alone or forced to share with other prisoners.",
      "While Ahmad said it was still considered one of the better wings because it housed foreign prisoners, cockroaches were crawling all over the wall next to a radiator and near a dirty faucet which would have provided water for both drinking and cleaning up after going to the bathroom.",
      "At the end of long corridor with cells either side, was a room for their guards.",
      "Tice, from Houston, disappeared on Aug. 13, 2012, just days after he celebrated his 31st birthday in Syria, where he was reporting on the civil war that began a year earlier. Video emerged shortly after he disappeared showing masked men holding him at gunpoint, but the U.S. government questioned the video\u2019s authenticity, suggesting it was staged.",
      "Ahmad, an activist and citizen journalist, said that he was arrested for filming anti-regime demonstrations and that Tice appeared to be in \u201csomewhat good\u201d condition in 2022.",
      "However, he said, \u201che was thin when I saw him. His neck bones were slightly protruding, but he was able to walk and move because they allowed him and other prisoners to exercise and walk for one hour in the prison corridor.\u201d",
      "Like other prisoners, Tice had his hair and eyebrows shaved off to prevent lice, but appeared healthy, able to walk, eat and communicate, said Ahmad, who is now based in Dubai.",
      "Tice\u2019s parents, Debra and Marc Tice, in an interview Monday with \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt,\u201d said that they had received information that before the rebels ousted Assad\u2019s government, their son not only was alive but was being well cared-for. However, they said, they had no clarity about who was holding their son.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting to see, because they\u2019re attending to the prisons little by little \u2014 and some of the larger prisons, we know those are not places that Austin is,\u201d Debra Tice said.",
      "And inside Syria, a senior rebel leader, Obeida Al-Arnout, said they were trying \u201cas much as possible to find information about Austin and return him to his mother, but we have not reached a result.\u201d",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as France's new prime minister on Friday as he sought to steer the country out of political chaos.",
    "story": [
      "President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as France's new prime minister on Friday as he sought to steer the country out of political chaos following a no-confidence vote that toppled former Prime Minister Michel Barnier\u2019s government last week.",
      "Bayrou, 73, the founder of the Democratic Movement party, will now face the task of trying to bring together a government that can push legislation through the same heavily divided parliament that came together in a rare moment of unity to oust Barnier on Dec. 5.",
      "At the top of his priorities will be addressing France's ailing economy and drafting a cost-cutting budget that will gain the approval of lawmakers \u2014 a difficult task that fueled Barnier's downfall.",
      "Barnier became France's shortest-serving prime minister after he was ousted just three months after Macron appointed him.",
      "Far-left and far-right lawmakers in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, came together to vote overwhelmingly against him in a no-confidence vote, with 331 lawmakers supporting the motion \u2014 dozens more than were required for it to pass.",
      "The vote came amid mounting fury over Barnier's efforts to push through a controversial 2025 budget using a rarely deployed constitutional mechanism to circumvent parliamentary approval.",
      "Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, who filed the no-confidence that delivered Barnier's demise, urged Bayrou not to follow in his footsteps and risk a similar fate.",
      "\"We ask him to undertake what his predecessor did not want to do: hear and listen to the opposition in order to construct a reasonable and thoughtful budget,\" Le Pen said in a post on X on Friday. \"Any other policy that would only be an extension of Macronism, twice rejected at the ballot box, could only lead to impasse and failure.\"",
      "Bayrou will be expected to put forward a list of ministers over the coming days, but it is unclear how he plans to navigate the difficult political landscape that brought down Barnier.",
      "Macron will be hoping Bayrou can avoid a similar outcome and no-confidence vote until at least July, which is the soonest France will be able to hold new parliamentary elections after Macron called snap legislative elections earlier this year, setting off France's current period of political turmoil.",
      "During this summer's elections, French voters flocked to the extremes, with the leftist coalition pulling ahead of Macron's centrists, and Le Pen's far right finishing a close third, giving her National Rally the largest share of seats in the party's history. The resulting legislature is deeply divided between the left, center and far-right, with none claiming enough power to hold a majority.",
      "Whether Bayrou will succeed in advancing legislation that the fractured parliament can agree on remains to be seen.",
      "While Barnier's ouster did not immediately affect Macron's position,  his future as president is likely to fall under scrutiny if France's government were to collapse again, with some opponents already calling for his resignation in recent weeks."
