      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Thousands of mourners gathered Saturday at San Francisco\u2019s Civic Center to celebrate the life of Bob Weir, the legendary guitarist and founding member of the Grateful Dead who died last week at age 78.",
      "Musicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey.",
      "Several asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia and bass guitarist Phil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here to celebrate Bob Weir,\u201d said Ruthie Garcia, who is no relation to Jerry, a fan since 1989. \u201cCelebrating him and helping him go home.\u201d",

But there were also young couples, men in their 20s and a father who brought his 6-year-old son in order to pass on to the next generation a love of live music and the tight-knit Deadhead community.",
      "The Bay Area native joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia\u2019s later in life.",
      "The Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia\u2019s death, morphing into Dead & Company with John Mayer.",
      "Darla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next.",

      "The Defense Department says it is revamping the military newspaper Stars and Stripes to focus on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and eliminate woke distractions",
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online steadily since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "Parnell did not return a message seeking details. The Daily Wire reported, after speaking a Pentagon spokeswoman, that the plan is to have all Stars and Stripes content written by active-duty service members. Currently, Congress has mandated that the publication's publisher and top editor be civilians, said Max Lederer, its publisher.",
      "The Pentagon also said that half of the outlet's content would be generated by the Defense Department, and that it would no longer publish material from The Associated Press or Reuters news services.",
      "Also Thursday, the Pentagon issued a statement in the Federal Register that it would eliminate some 1990s era directives that governed how Stars and Stripes operates. Lederer said it's not clear what that would mean for the outlet's operations, or whether the Defense Department has the authority to do so without congressional authorization.",
      "The publisher said he believes that Stars and Stripes is valued by the military community precisely because of its independence as a news organization. He said no one at the Pentagon has communicated to him what it wants from Stars and Stripes; he first learned of its intentions from reading Parnell's social media post.",
      "\u201cThis will either destroy the value of the organization or significantly reduce its value,\u201d Lederer said.",

      "\u201cI think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\u201d Smith said.

      "The Post reported that applicants to Stars and Stripes were being asked how they would advance Trump's executive orders and policy priorities in the role. They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",
      "Smith said it was the government's Office of Personnel Management \u2014 not the newspaper \u2014 that was responsible for the question on job applications and said it was consistent with what was being asked of applicants for other government jobs.",
      "But she said it was not something that should be asked of journalists. \u201cThe loyalty is to the truth, not the administration,\u201d she said.",

      "The avant-noise artist Kim Gordon debuted solo music 10 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago, Kim Gordon \u2014 a revolutionary force in the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, the \u201980s New York no wave scene and the space between art and noise \u2014 debuted solo music. At the time, she was already decades into a celebrated, mixed-medium creative career.",
      "The midtempo \u201cMurdered Out\u201d was her first single, where clangorous, overdubbed guitars met the unmistakable rasp of her deadpan intonations. It was a surprise from an experimentalist well-versed in the unexpected: The song took inspiration from Los Angeles car culture, and its main collaborator was the producer Justin Raisen, then best known for his pop work with Sky Ferreira and Charli XCX. Their partnership has continued in the decade since, and on March 13, Gordon will drop her third solo album, \u201cPlay Me,\u201d announced Wednesday alongside the release of a hazy, transcendent single, \u201cNot Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a happy accident,\u201d she says of her continued work with Raisen. \u201cIn the beginning, I was somewhat skeptical of working with a producer and collaborator, really. But it\u2019s turned out to be incredibly freeing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlay Me\u201d follows Gordon's critically lauded, beat-heavy 2024 album \u201cThe Collective,\u201d a noisy body of work that featured oddball trap blasts. It earned her two Grammy nominations \u2014 a career first \u2014 for alternative music album and alternative music performance. Those were for the song \u201cBye Bye,\u201d with its eerie, dissonant beat originally written for rapper Playboi Carti. For \u201cPlay Me,\u201d Gordon reimagined the track for the closer, \u201cBye Bye 25!\u201d She says it was the result of her thinking about the rap world, where revisiting and remixing is commonplace.",
      "\u201cI came up with the idea of using these words that Trump had sort of \u2018banned\u2019 in his mind,\u201d she says of the new song's lyrics. (An example: \u201cInjustice / Opportunity / Dietary guidelines / Housing for the future.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.) For Gordon, because it became \u201cmore conceptual \u2026 the remake doesn\u2019t seem as anxiety-provoking as the original.\u201d",
      "There is a connective spirit between \u201cThe Collective\u201d and \u201cPlay Me\u201d \u2014 a shared confrontation, propulsive production and songs that possess a keen ability to process and reflect the world around Gordon. \u201cIt does feel kind of like an evolution,\u201d she says of this album next to her last. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a more focused record, and immediate.\u201d The songs are shorter and attentive.",
      "Or, to put it more simply: \u201cI like beats and that inspires me more than melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cBeats and space.\u201d",
      "That palette drives \u201cPlay Me,\u201d a foundation in which staccato lyricism transforms and offers astute criticism. Consider the title track, which challenges passive listening and the devaluation of music in the age of streaming. She names Spotify playlist titles, imagined genres defined by mood rather than music. \u201cRich popular girl / Villain mode\u201d she speak-sings, \u201cJazz and background / Chillin' after work.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just representative of, you know, this era we're in, this culture of convenience,\u201d she says. \u201cMusic always represented a certain amount of freedom to me, and it feels like that\u2019s kind of been blanketed over.\u201d",
      "Sonically, it is a message delivered atop a '70s groove, placing it in conversation with an era unshackled from these digital technologies.",
      "The title, too, \u201cis playing off the sort of passive nature of listening to music,\u201d she says, \u201cBut also it could be seen as defiant. Like, I dare you to play me.\u201d",
      "There's also the blown-out \u201cSubcon,\u201d which examines the world's growing billionaire class and their fascination with space colonialization in a period of economic insecurity. In the song, Gordon's lyrical abstractions highlight the absurdity, taking aim at technocrats.",
      "\u201cI find reality inspirational, no matter how bad it is,\u201d she says. Where some artists might veer away from the news, Gordon tackles truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what music is supposed to be. So, I\u2019m just doing my version of it.\u201d",
      "In the end, she hopes listeners are \u201csomewhat thrilled by\u201d the album.",

      "NEW YORK -- An emotional plea by Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi and moving words from Ryan Coogler on the violence in Minneapolis stirred a National Board of Review Awards ceremony Tuesday in which Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d was again crowned the best film of the year.",
      "Coming two days after Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes, the annual, untelevised New York gala, held in the cavernous midtown banquet all Cipriani 42nd Street and hosted by Willie Geist, played out as a more intimate and frank-spoken alternative.",
      "The winners themselves were already announced, so the night was always going to belong to \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d The National Board of review, a group that is made up of film enthusiasts and dates to 1909, not only named it 2025\u2019s best film but awarded the best actor prize to Leonardo DiCaprio, best director to Anderson, best supporting actor to Benicio Del Toro and breakthrough performer to Chase Infiniti.",
      "Yet in an ongoing parade of awards for \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d its night at the NBRs still stood out. The surprise presenter of the movie\u2019s best film award was Martin Scorsese, who praised \u201cthe audacity\u201d of Anderson\u2019s narratives and the accomplishment of his latest.",
      "\u201cLike all great films, it can\u2019t really be compared to anything else,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt stands alone. It\u2019s a great American film.\u201d",
      "Anderson, trying to take in the wealth of honors, attempted to describe what \u201c One Battle After Another,\u201d his father-daughter tale of revolution, might represent. His answer came in pointing out his own daughter, sitting at his table.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what our movie is about, but I do know it\u2019s about loving your kids,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "For many of the honorees, the world outside the starry banquet weighed heavily. Coogler\u2019s speech was among the night\u2019s most poignant. The \u201cSinners\u201d director was honored for his screenplay for the vampire thriller and was introduced by the film\u2019s star, longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan.",
      "Both were honored 13 years earlier by the board for their first movie together, \u201c Fruitvale Station.\u201d Recalling that film, based on the true story of the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer in Oakland, California, Coogler turned to the recent fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration enforcement agent in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cI was young and naive, and I thought the movie was going to change the world and make it so you didn\u2019t see people executed by civil service on camera anymore,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cI was proven wrong again and again. And it\u2019s tough to be here and not think about Minnesota.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be here and not think about Renee,\u201d Coogler added.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Organizers of Australia\u2019s largest free literary festival canceled the event Tuesday after more than 180 writers and speakers withdrew over the scrapping of an appearance by an Australian-Palestinian writer and academic.",
      "The uproar began when the board of the Adelaide Festival, which runs Adelaide Writers Week, announced on Jan. 8 that they had disinvited Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from the event \u201cgiven her previous statements\u201d and citing cultural sensitivities \u201cat this unprecedented time so soon after\u201d an antisemitic mass shooting at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach.",

      "They didn\u2019t cite any specific statements by the lawyer, academic and writer of fiction and nonfiction that prompted their decision. Abdel-Fattah decried the move as \u201ccensorship\u201d and said the announcement suggested that her \u201cmere presence\u201d was culturally insensitive.",
      "By Tuesday, when the event was canceled, most of the programmed speakers had withdrawn. The episode unfolded amid a fraught national debate in Australia about limits on speech following the Bondi shooting.",
      "A father and son who were apparently inspired by Islamic State group ideology are accused of the massacre during a Hanukkah event in December, in which 15 people were shot dead. The surviving suspect, Naveed Akram, has not entered a plea to the dozens of murder, terrorism and other charges he faces.",
      "In the aftermath, the Jewish Community Council for South Australia \u2014 the state where Adelaide is located \u2014 wrote to the festival to lobby for Abdel-Fattah\u2019s exclusion, the group's spokesperson Norman Schueler told The Adelaide Advertiser. The Premier of South Australia state Peter Malinauskus also supported the writer\u2019s removal.",
      "The Adelaide Writers Week was scheduled to run for six days beginning in late February, as part of a wider annual culture festival. The 2025 literary event was the festival\u2019s 40th and attracted 160,000 attendees.",
      "Born in Australia to Palestinian and Egyptian parents, Abdel-Fattah often writes about Islamophobia and had been invited to speak about her novel Discipline, which follows two Muslims, a journalist and a university student, navigating issues of censorship in Sydney. She has been a critic of the Israeli government and an advocate for Palestinians throughout the two-year war in Gaza.",
      "After the board\u2019s statement canceling Abdel-Fattah\u2019s appearance, other speakers on the program \u2014 including British novelist Zadie Smith and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2014 withdrew from their events too.

      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",

      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",

      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

      "Two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show wastewater monitoring of measles can flag measles spread days to weeks in advance",
      "Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to measles infections days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.",
      "The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including COVID-19, polio, mpox and bird flu.",
      "But the national wastewater surveillance system, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about $125 million a year to about $25 million.",
      "Peggy Honein, director of the CDC's division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would \u201csustain some of the most critical activities\u201d but \u201cit would likely require some prioritization.\u201d",
      "The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six \u201ccenters for excellence\u201d \u2014 Colorado among them \u2014 that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing.",
      "The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started pushing back against cuts to health care in general.",
      "But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.",
      "Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado\u2019s wastewater surveillance unit.",
      "The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.",
      "\u201cI know that there are other states that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as us,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.\u201d",
      "In the Colorado study, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado.",
      "In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases.",

      "The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe knew that we were missing cases, and I think that's always the case in measles outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. \u201cBut this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.\u201d",
      "Other states, such as Utah, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.",
      "And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state's system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department.",
      "The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.",

      "And the monthly death toll is still not back to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, let alone where it was before the current overdose epidemic struck decades ago, said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "\u201cOverall I think this continues to be encouraging, especially since we're seeing declines almost across the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Overdose deaths began steadily climbing in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths from heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Deaths peaked nearly 110,000 in 2022, fell a little in 2023 and then plummeted 27% in 2024, to around 80,000. That was the largest one-year decline ever recorded.",
      "The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data runs through August 2025 and represents the first update of monthly provisional drug overdose deaths since the federal government shutdown.",

      "CDC officials reported that deaths were down in all states except Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico and North Dakota. But they noted it's likely that not all overdose deaths have been reported yet in every state, and additional data in the future might affect that state count.",
      "Researchers cannot yet say with confidence why deaths have gone down. Experts have offered multiple possible explanations: increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in how people use drugs, and the growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.",

      "The recent deceleration of overdose deaths could be because producers in Canada and Mexico found alternative sources, Reuter and his colleagues think.",
      "Their paper drew inspiration from a team of University of Pittsburgh researchers, who earlier concluded that regulatory changes in China concerning the drug carfentanil were an important explanation for a dip in U.S. overdose deaths in 2018.",
      "Those same Pittsburgh researchers \u2014 Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Hawre Jalal \u2014 are now focused on another theory for what's happened to overdose deaths. In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Drug Policy, they say overdose trends may be at least partly tied to federal stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "That money alleviated economic hardship for many families, but some of it also helped people pay for illicit drugs, the Pittsburgh researchers say. And the end of those payments helps explain why overdoses stabilized in 2022 and began falling afterward, they say.",

      "Louisiana is pushing to extradite a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills, challenging laws that protect telehealth providers shipping these pills nationwide",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana pushed Tuesday to extradite a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills, setting up a likely test of laws designed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "This is the second time Louisiana has pursued an out-of-state doctor under its abortion restrictions, with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry saying on social media that he wants to bring the abortion provider \u201cto justice.\u201d The two criminal cases pit Louisiana, which has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, against jurisdictions that have enacted what are known as shield laws for providers who facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has a zero tolerance policy for those who subvert our laws, seek to hurt women, and promote abortion,\u201d Landry said in a post X announcing he'd sent the extradition paperwork. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment",
      "Remy Coeytaux, a physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, faces a criminal charge of abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday. If convicted, the doctor could face up to 50 years in jail and fines, Murrill said.",
      "An email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "According to court documents, he is accused of mailing mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 to a Louisiana woman who sought the medication through Aid Access, a European online telemedicine service. The woman took the pills in combination to end her pregnancy, investigators wrote in the indictment, which says authorities confirmed Coeytaux as the sender.",
      "Murrill told The Associated Press she believes this \u201cis not the only time he sent abortion pills into our state\u201d and that \u201cit probably won't be the last time we will indict him.\u201d",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that is representing Coeytaux against civil charges, stressed that the criminal charge in Louisiana is an allegation.",

      "Coeytaux is also the subject of a separate federal lawsuit filed in July in Texas, where a man alleges the doctor illegally provided abortion medication to his girlfriend.",
      "Medication abortion has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2000. Louisiana bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. Physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. Last year, state lawmakers passed additional restrictions targeting out-of-state prescribers and reclassified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "The law came after an arrest warrant was issued in Louisiana in a separate case for a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a pregnant minor. In that case, officials said the minor\u2019s mother ordered the medication online and directed her daughter to take it. The mother was later arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",
      "That case appeared to be the first of its kind since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "Louisiana also sought that doctor\u2019s extradition, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused, saying her state\u2019s shield laws were designed to protect providers who offer abortion care to patients in states with bans or where telehealth prescribing is restricted. New York and California are among eight states with such protections, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",

      "New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available",
      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously recommended another drug, oral azithromycin, alongside injectable ceftriaxone, but dropped the pill from its guidance after signs that gonorrhea was growing resistant to it.",
      "\u201cWe were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",

      "As more people test at home it could become harder to track national infection rates, which previously have been reported by a handful of large testing laboratories.",

      "BERLIN -- The eight European countries targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump for a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland blasted the move Sunday, warning that his threats \u201cundermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\u201d",
      "The joint statement by some of America\u2019s closest allies signaled a possible turning point in the recent tensions over sovereignty and security nearly 24 hours after Trump\u2019s threat.",
      "It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and flattery around him, even when seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. Sunday\u2019s statement, as well as some European countries sending troops to Greenland for a Danish military training exercise, appeared to be a step away from that strategy.",
      "The unusually strong joint statement from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland said troops sent to Greenland for operation \u201cArctic Endurance\u201d pose \u201cno threat to anyone.\u201d",
      "Trump's Saturday announcement sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. He appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security.",
      "\u201cWe stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" the group said. \u201cBuilding on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\u201d",
      "There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs because the European Union is a single economic zone in terms of trading. It was unclear, too, how Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a U.S. Supreme Court challenge.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from divisions between the U.S. and Europe. She added in a post on social media: \u201cIf Greenland\u2019s security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.\"",
      "Europe has been trying to keep Trump on its side to ensure U.S. support for Ukraine, including Washington sharing intelligence with Kyiv and its involvement in security guarantees if a peace agreement is reached with Russia.",
      "Rasmus S\u00f8ndergaard, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, called Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cunprecedented\u201d because tariff threats normally stem from trade disagreements, not territorial disputes between allies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s of course why we\u2019re seeing the response from European countries saying \u2019enough is enough,\u2019\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI think there\u2019s in part probably a strategic calculation, of course, from the governments in these countries that if you give in to Trump on this, what will be the next thing? And at some point you have to sort of push back.\u201d",
      "S\u00f8ndergaard also said Trump leveled the playing field for Europe with the tariff threat. Europeans cannot compete militarily, but the EU can wield an economic weapon through reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe EU has the ability to really strike back with force if they want to, and it will hurt European economies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will hurt American economies. The challenge for Trump is he has midterms coming up and it\u2019s not going to help him if the U.S. goes into more of an economic recession or more of a economic turmoil than is already the case.\u201d",

      "LISBON, Portugal -- A record 11 candidates are standing in Portugal\u2019s presidential election Sunday, with a populist party leader poised to possibly bring another political breakthrough for Europe\u2019s growing far-right parties.",
      "The large field makes it unlikely that any candidate will capture more than 50% of the vote for a first-round win. That would leave the two top candidates to compete in a runoff ballot next month.",
      "Almost 11 million people are eligible to vote in the election, with most results expected late in the day. The winner will replace President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the limit of two five-year terms.",
      "Polls opened at 8 a.m. on a mostly sunny day across the country and were due to close 12 hours later.",
      "By midday, just over 20% of registered voters had cast their ballot, up from 17% in the last presidential election in 2021, authorities said.",
      "Among the front-runners, according to recent opinion polls, are Andr\u00e9 Ventura, the leader of the populist Chega (Enough) party. Chega\u2019s surge in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal\u2019s parliament last year, just six years after it was founded.",
      "One of Ventura\u2019s main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years. \u201cPortugal is ours,\u201d he says.",
      "During the election campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t Bangladesh\u201d and \u201cImmigrants shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live on welfare.\u201d",
      "Such blatant anti-immigrant sentiment expressed in public was unthinkable in Portugal just a few years ago.",
      "Other leading candidates are from the country\u2019s two main parties that have alternated in power for the past half-century: Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes from the center-right Social Democratic Party, currently in government, and Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro of the center-left Socialist Party.",

Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.",

      "The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation\u2019s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.",
      "\u201cEnsuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump\u2019s top priorities,\u201d said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.",
      "Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.",
      "\"We can\u2019t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,\" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.",
      "When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.",
      "At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Trump has demanded a 10% cap on credit card interest rates by Jan. 20.",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump a week ago told the credit card industry it had until Jan. 20 to comply with his demand for a 10% cap on interest rates. With just days to go, consumer groups, politicians, and bankers alike remain unclear on what the White House has planned and whether Trump even remains serious about the idea.",
      "So far, the White House has not provided any detail about what will happen to credit card companies that don\u2019t lower card rates. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president has \u201can expectation\u201d that credit card companies will accede to his demand that they cap interest rates on credit cards at 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a specific consequence to outline for you but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\u201d she said Friday.",
      "A researcher who studied Trump\u2019s proposal when Trump first floated it during the 2024 presidential campaign found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back. The administration has amplified that research, posting it on one of the White House\u2019s official Twitter pages.",
      "Bank lobbyists, many who have been spending much of the past week scrambling to figure out what the White House has planned for their industry, have been left in the dark. There have been bills introduced into both houses of Congress by both Republicans and Democrats this year and years past, but House and Senate Republican leadership have been cold to the idea of passing a law capping interest rates.",
      "The Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed after the 2008 financial crisis that overhauled the financial industry, explicitly prohibits at least one federal bank regulator from setting usury limits on loans.",
      "Without a law or executive order, it may simply come down to Trump using political pressure to force the credit card industry to do what he wants, as he\u2019s done with other industries. For example, Trump demanded that pharmaceutical companies cut drug prices, which resulted in some pledges by drug industry CEOs to do what he asked. Trump also demanded chip makers and tech companies move production to the U.S., which also resulted in companies like Apple committing to build more manufacturing capacity domestically.",
      "Wall Street has little interest in an all-out war with the White House, especially as banks have benefitted from the industry-friendly, deregulatory agenda that Trump administration has provided so far. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed in to law in July, pushed another significant round of tax cuts. And deregulation pushed companies to embrace dealmaking last year, which led to a steady stream of investment banking revenues and fees to the big banks.",
      "When it comes to credit card rates, the messaging out of the bank lobbying groups and bank executives has been two-fold: They have pushed back on the cap but in the same breath have offered to work with the White House.",

Its customers collectively holding $239.4 billion in balances with the bank, and it has major co-brand partnerships with companies such as United Airlines and Amazon.

But at the same time, Mason said, \u201cAffordability is a big issue, and we look forward to collaborating with the administration on ways we can address this.\u201d",
      "Trump took further aim at the card industry when he endorsed a bill in Congress that could negatively impact the amount of money banks earn from merchants every time a customer swipes their card.",

While effectively a promotional rate that other credit card companies have used in the past, Bilt\u2019s move could provide an example of how the credit card industry can meet the White House's demands without fundamentally destroying their business model.",

      "The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2014 a regional trade pact that allows many goods to cross North American borders duty free \u2014 comes up for renewal this year. Trump is almost sure to demand changes meant to shift manufacturing to the United States \u2014 and might threaten to pull out of the deal altogether, especially if he is inclined to punish Carney for reversing his policy with China.",
      "That\u2019s a scary thought for Canada, which sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States.",
      "The Canada-China deal Friday \u201cwill make the talks more complicated. Trump will not be pleased with the Canadian action, will probably take some retaliatory measure, probably against the Canadian auto industry, and will certainly make it an issue in the USMCA talks,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "On Friday anyway, Trump commended Carney: \u201cIf you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\u2033 And Carney noted Friday that the China deal is preliminary, potentially giving him flexibility to seek changes if necessary to head off a conflict the U.S.",
      "He also might be counting on getting a little help from U.S. businesses. American automakers depend on a network of plants across the U.S., Canada and Mexico and \u201cwill fight tooth and nail\u2019\u2019 to defend USMCA. American farmers also rely on the pact for access to the Mexican and Canadian markets. And U.S. tech companies like the way USMCA liberalized digital trade in North America.",
      "For now, Lovely said, Carney\u2019s deal with China, sends \u201ca big signal that Canada is looking to other partners and has options that would allow it to walk away from the USMCA before it makes humiliating compromises to serve only American interests.\u2019\u2019",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear an appeal from global agrochemical manufacturer Bayer to block thousands of state lawsuits alleging it failed to warn people that its popular weedkiller could cause cancer.",
      "The justices will consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency's approval of the Roundup weedkiller without a cancer warning should rule out the state court claims.",
      "The Trump administration has weighed in on Bayer's behalf, reversing the Biden administration's position and putting it at odds with some supporters of the Make America Healthy Again agenda who oppose giving the company the legal immunity it seeks.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.",
      "Bayer disputes the cancer claims but has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. At the same time, it has tried to persuade states to pass laws barring the lawsuits. Georgia and North Dakota have done so.",
      "The high court will take up a case from Missouri, in which a jury awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis.",
      "The Supreme Court in 2022 declined to hear a similar claim from Bayer in a California case that awarded more than $86 million to a married couple.",
      "But Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, contends the Supreme Court should intervene now because lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. In 2024, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bayer\u2019s favor.",

But glyphosate remains in agricultural products. It\u2019s designed to be used with genetically modified seeds, including corn, soybeans and cotton, that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Bayer has said it might have to consider pulling glyphosate from U.S. agricultural markets if the lawsuits persist.",

      "Brazilian President Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen celebrate the expected signing of a free trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday celebrated the expected signing of the free trade agreement between the EU and four South American countries the following day at a ceremony that Lula will not attend.",
      "This is the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which includes the region\u2019s two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, along with Paraguay and Uruguay. The two blocs are expected to formally sign their quarter-century-in-the-making trade pact this Saturday at a ceremony in Paraguay. Bolivia, the newest Mercosur member, was not involved in negotiations but can join the agreement in the coming years.",
      "While local media reported that Argentina\u2019s Javier Milei and Uruguay\u2019s Yamand\u00fa Orsi will be present at the ceremony hosted by Paraguay\u2019s Santiago Pe\u00f1a, Lula decided not to make the trip to the capital Asuncion.",
      "Instead, the Brazilian leader will be represented by Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira.",
      "That caused some surprise, in light of Lula\u2019s energetic efforts in favor of the deal, particularly since returning to Brazil's presidency in 2023 for a third, nonconsecutive term. Experts say the move may hint at Lula\u2019s disappointment the deal was not signed in December, when Brazil had the rotating presidency of Mercosur.",
      "In Rio, Lula again pointed to how long the negotiations had taken.",
      "\u201cIt was more than 25 years of suffering and attempts to get a deal,\u201d Lula said during a short statement to the press at Itamaraty Palace in downtown Rio alongside von der Leyen.",
      "But he hailed the historic nature of the pact.",
      "\u201cTomorrow in Asuncion, we will make history by creating one of the world\u2019s largest free trade areas, bringing together some 720 million people and a GDP of over $22 trillion,\u201d he said.",
      "The European Commission\u2019s president paid warm tribute to Lula for his efforts in making the deal happen.",
      "\u201cThe political leadership, the personal commitment and passion that you have shown in the last weeks and months, dear Lula, are truly second to none,\u201d said von der Leyen.",
      "In a statement ahead of von der Leyen and European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa\u2019s trip to South America, the European Council also said that the latest Brazilian presidency of Mercosur was crucial to advance negotiations, paving the way to its signature in Paraguay.",

      "\u201cThis is the power of partnership and openness. This is the power of friendship and understanding between peoples and regions across oceans,\u201d von der Leyen said. \u201cAnd this is how we create real prosperity \u2014 prosperity that is shared. Because, we agree, that international trade is not a zero-sum game.\u201d",
      "The victory for the EU and Mercosur comes at the expense of the U.S. and China, experts say, as Trump aggressively asserts American authority in the resource-rich region and Beijing uses its massive trade and loans to build influence.",

      "While the deal is asymmetrical and undoubtedly economically favorable to the European Union, politically the agreement is beneficial for both parties, said Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia.",
      "For the European Union, which is under pressure amid Trump\u2019s threats to seize control of Greenland, the deal shows that the group of countries is betting on the diversification of its partners and multilateralism, Goulart said, in a symbolic rebuke of Trump\u2019s MAGA logic.",
      "\u201cAnd for Mercosur, it illustrates that the bloc is relevant, despite accusations of being insignificant and on its last legs.\u201d",

      "\u201cI actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said at a White House event, when he saw Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, in the audience. \u201dI just want to thank you, you were fantastic on television the other day.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments, while not clearly definitive, have upended expectations around the extensive search the White House has undergone to find a new Fed chair, one of the most powerful financial positions in the world. The president's remarks have boosted the prospects for Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and already a top contender for the position.",
      "Hassett has generally been seen as the front-runner in the race to replace Powell because he has worked for Trump since his first presidential term. Last month, Trump referred to Hassett as a \u201cpotential Fed chair.\u201d",
      "Powell\u2019s term as chair will end May 15, though he could take the unusual step of remaining on the board as governor afterward. Trump appointed Powell in 2018 but soon soured on him for raising the Fed's key interest rate that year.",
      "Warsh's candidacy has also likely been boosted by the Justice Department's subpoenas of the Federal Reserve last week, revealed Sunday in an unusually direct video statement by Powell. The Fed chair charged that the subpoenas were essentially punishment for the central bank's refusal to lower interest rates as sharply as Trump would like.",

      "The backlash has intensified concerns in the Senate, analysts say, that the Trump administration is seeking to undermine the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. That, in turn, may reduce Hassett's prospects.",
      "The brouhaha over the subpoenas is \u201cmaking it harder to confirm Hassett, who is distinctively close to the president,\u201d Krishna Guha, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote in a client note. \u201cWarsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm.\u201d",
      "Yet Warsh, historically, is known as a \u201chawk,\u201d or someone who traditionally supports higher interest rates to ward off inflation, as opposed to a \u201cdove,\u201d or someone who prefers lower borrowing costs to spur hiring and growth.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose Friday, to just above 4.2%, from about 4.17% Thursday. The increase likely reflected a sense that Warsh's chances had improved, and as a result the Fed would be less likely over time to cut rates than under a Hassett chairmanship.",

      "Thailand's construction industry is facing intense scrutiny after several deadly accidents",
      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s construction industry is under intense scrutiny following a series of high-profile deadly accidents. These include a crane falling onto a moving passenger train this past week and the collapse of an office tower a year ago that killed nearly 100 workers.",
      "Public concern is particularly high in Bangkok due to the frequent and sometimes fatal construction accidents on major road projects. In the latest case, a construction crane collapsed on Thursday, killing two people, just a day after the train tragedy in which 32 people died.",
      "Public outrage has centered on Italian-Thai Development, the contractor responsible for both sites where the past week's accidents occurred. The company, also known as Italthai, was also the joint lead contractor for the 33-story State Audit Office building, which toppled while under construction in March, killing about 100 people.",
      "It was the only major structure in Thailand to collapse from an earthquake whose epicenter was in Myanmar, more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away.",
      "Twenty-three individuals and companies were indicted in that case, including Italthai\u2019s President Premchai Karnasuta, on charges including professional negligence causing death and document forgery. Italthai, a major developer in Thailand which has won many government projects, has denied wrongdoing in that case as well as the more recent crane crashes.",
      "Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has responded to the latest incidents by ordering the Transport Ministry to terminate contracts with, blacklist and prosecute the companies involved. Unfinished projects will be funded by seizing performance bonds and bank guarantees, with the government reserving the right to sue for extra costs. Additionally, a \u201cscorecard\u201d system to keep track of contractors\u2019 performance records should be enforced by early February.",
      "Investigators can often find the technical cause of accidents, such as human error or equipment failure.",
      "But critics say construction safety faces broader systemic problems, pointing to lax regulation, poor enforcement, and corruption. A lengthy investigation determined that the building collapse in March, though triggered by an earthquake, was fundamentally caused by flawed structural design and effort to evade regulations.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Thailand fails in terms of the body of knowledge in engineering or even in the technical aspects,\u201d said Panudech Chumyen, a civil engineering lecturer at Bangkok\u2019s Thammasat University. \u201cI think there\u2019s a failure in our system; there are so many gaps that I don\u2019t know where we should begin to close them.\u201d",
      "He said the safety challenges range from laxity in law enforcement to red tape and the lack of integration in safety policies among different stakeholders in projects. He also pointed to a shortage of independent assessors without conflicts of interest, which often results in performance reports that do not reflect reality.",
      "The involvement of Chinese companies in the building collapse, as well as troubled rail and road projects, has also drawn attention.",

      "The agreement cuts U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15% in exchange for $250 billion in new investments in the U.S. tech industry. It is comparable to deals with the European Union and Japan worked out after President Donald Trump proposed sweeping tariffs for many U.S. trading partners.",
      "\u201cFor the time being, we obtained the best tariff deal enjoyed by the countries with trade surplus with the U.S.,\" said Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai. \"This also shows that the U.S. sees Taiwan as an important strategic partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur goal is to lower mutual tariffs\u201d Cho said. \u201cTherefore, according to the results of the negotiations, Taiwan has successfully obtained 15% in tariffs with no added fees. This is the same tariff imposed on Japan, Korea and the European Union.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Commerce said the deal with Taiwan would establish an economic partnership to create several world-class U.S.-based industrial parks to help increase domestic manufacturing. It's \u201ca historic trade deal that will drive a massive reshoring of America\u2019s semiconductor sector,\u201d the department said in a statement.",

      "The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will he take the unusual step of remaining a governor?",
      "Powell's term as Fed chair finishes on May 15, but because of the central bank's complex structure, he has a separate term as one of seven members of its governing board that lasts until January 31, 2028. Historically, nearly all Fed chairs have stepped down from the board when they are no longer chair. But Powell could be the first in nearly 50 years to stay on as a governor.",
      "Many Fed-watchers believe that the criminal investigation into Powell's testimony about cost overruns for Fed building renovations was intended to intimidate him out of taking that step. If Powell stays on the board, it would deny the White House a chance to gain a majority, undercutting the Trump administration's efforts to seize greater control over what has for decades been an institution largely insulated from day-to-day politics.",
      "\u201cI find it very difficult to see Powell leaving before midnight on Jan. 31, 2028,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top economist at the Fed and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"This is a mortal threat to the governance structure of the Fed as we\u2019ve known it for 90 years. And I think that Powell does take that threat exceedingly seriously, and therefore will believe that it is his solemn duty to continue to occupy his seat on the board of governors.\u201d",
      "Powell, 72, was appointed as Fed chair by Trump in 2018, and must step down from the position in May because his second four-year term is ending. He has declined several times to comment on his plans beyond that when asked by reporters. A spokesperson declined to comment for this story.",
      "Trump has sought to push out Powell before his time is up, obsessively attacking him for not cutting rates as sharply as the president wants, particularly in light of ongoing concerns about high costs for groceries, utilities, and housing that have remained a salient political issue even as inflation has cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump highlighted that mortgage rates have declined in the past year. \u201cIf I had the help of the Fed, it would be easier,\u201d he said. \"But that jerk will be gone soon.\u201d",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Here is a look at the impacts of whether or not Powell stays on the board could have:",
      "Trump said Tuesday that he hopes to name a new Fed chair in the next few weeks. But that could get held up by the criminal investigation of Powell.",
      "Several Republican senators, including at least two on the banking committee who would have to approve Trump\u2019s nominees to the Fed, have expressed skepticism that Powell committed crimes during his testimony last June regarding the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump has criticized as excessive.

      "So even if Trump nominates a chair who seeks to do the president\u2019s bidding regarding interest rates, that person \u201cwould have very little persuasive power with his colleagues,\" said Wilcox, who is also director of research at Bloomberg Economics. Powell, along with other members of the Fed's 19-member interest-rate setting committee, could outvote the new chair. That hasn't happened since 1986.",

      "Several of those bank presidents have expressed opposition to the deep rate cuts that Trump has demanded. The board of governors could seek to have them fired if a chair wanted to do so.",
      "While nearly all Fed chairs have left the board of governors before their terms were up, there is some precedent for Powell to stay. In 1978, then-Chair Arthur Burns stayed on the board for about three weeks after his chairmanship ended. But in 1948, then-Fed chairman Marriner Eccles remained as a governor for three years after finishing as chair, in part because President Harry Truman asked him to remain.",

Years later, Truman ran into Martin in New York City and called him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d The Fed's second office building in Washington is named after Martin.",
      "\u201cSo it's a cautionary tale also for Trump, thinking he's going to get his own Fed chair in there,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University who studies the Fed. \u201cMartin didn't do what Truman wanted.\u201d",

      "Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down from Lucasfilm after more than 13 years",
      "After more than 13 years at the helm of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d factory founded by George Lucas.",
      "The Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday that it will now turn to Dave Filoni to steer \u201cStar Wars\u201d into its sixth decade and beyond. Filoni, who served as the chief commercial officer of Lucasfilm, and Lynwen Brennan, president and general manager of Lucasfilm\u2019s businesses, will inherit the mantle of one of the movies\u2019 marquee franchises.",
      "Kennedy, Lucas\u2019 handpicked successor, had presided over the ever-expanding science-fiction world of \u201cStar Wars\u201d since Disney acquired it in 2012. She oversaw a highly lucrative but often contentious period in \u201cStar Wars\u201d history that yielded a blockbuster trilogy and acclaimed streaming spinoffs such as \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d yet found increasing frustration from longtime fans.",
      "Under Kennedy\u2019s stewardship, Lucasfilm amassed more than $5.6 billion in box office and helped establish Disney+ as a streaming destination \u2014 achievements that easily validated the $4.05 billion Disney plunked down for the company. But Kennedy also struggled to deliver the big-screen magic that Lucas captured in the original trilogy from the late 1970s and early 1980s, and her relationship with \u201cStar Wars\u201d loyalists became a saga of its own.",
      "While Filoni and Brennan will share leadership, Brennan is considered the more financially oriented executive. Filoni will have the creative reins. He\u2019s established himself almost entirely on the small screen, entering the franchise with the animated series \u201cStar Wars: The Clone Wars\u201d and creating the tepidly received Disney+ series \u201cAhsoka.\u201d Filoni, who first collaborated with Lucas on \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender,\u201d has also been an executive producer on \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d \u201cThe Book of Boba Fett\u201d and \u201cSkeleton Crew.\u201d",
      "Before joining Lucasfilm, Kennedy was one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful producers ever. In 1981, she co-founded Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg and her eventual husband, Frank Marshall. She produced \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d trilogy.",

But the subsequent installment, Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d (2017), was bitterly divisive. The third film, Abrams\u2019 \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d (2019), was widely panned by critics and fans, alike.",
      "After \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d went dark on the big screen despite a litany of announced projects. The dry spell is set to be broken in May by Jon Favreau\u2019s \u201cThe Mandalorian & Grogu.\u201d The intervening years have been marked by streaming successes in \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d but the future of \u201cStar Wars\u201d has felt increasingly uncertain.",
      "Struggles over tone and vision have been frequent. The 2018 Han Solo spinoff \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d saw its directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, fired during production and replaced by Ron Howard. Most found the mixed-and-matched result blandly disappointing.",
      "More recently, Adam Driver, who played Kylo Ren/Ben Solo in the most recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy,\u201d divulged to The Associated Press last year that he and Steven Soderbergh had developed a Ben Solo film with Kennedy and Lucasfilm\u2019s support for two years before Disney chief Bob Iger nixed it. Fans were so irate that a plane was flown over Disney\u2019s Burbank studios with a banner reading \u201cSave \u2018The Hunt for Ben Solo.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, the only \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie of Kennedy\u2019s stewardship to win widespread and prevailing approval from fans was arguably 2016\u2019s \u201cRogue One.\u201d Gareth Edwards\u2019 spinoff was also a troubled production, leading to Tony Gilroy, eventual creator of \u201cAndor,\u201d overseeing reshoots. Yet despite that, \u201cRogue One\u201d \u2014 taking place within \u201cStar Wars\u201d but outside of the main Jedi storyline \u2014 might be the only film of Kennedy\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d reign that managed to both stay true to the space odyssey\u2019s tone and to break new ground.",

      "The North American International Auto Show in Detroit once dedicated an entire track on its coveted show floor to getting consumers comfortable with electric vehicles and charging",
      "DETROIT -- At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.",
      "But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.",
      "\u201cThe show will always reflect what\u2019s happening in the industry at the consumer level,\u201d said Todd Szott, chairman of this year\u2019s event and an auto dealer. \u201cObviously things have changed in the EV landscape.\u201d",
      "Some industry players say they're emphasizing \u201cconsumer choice\u201d in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe \u2014 especially China \u2014 electrifies.",
      "\u201cWhat we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,\u201d Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.",
      "Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold \u2014 a slight decline from 2024.)",
      "None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.",
      "\u201cAmong my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don\u2019t have to have an electric car,\u201d Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.",
      "Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation\u2019s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards \u2014 going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them \u2014 and gas mileage rules.",
      "\u201cI love electric cars. I think they\u2019re great,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.",
      "Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.",
      "\u201cI still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,\u201d said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. \u201cWe still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.\u201d",
      "But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.",

The bank sold the credit card portfolio at a discount to JPMorgan, a sign of how desperately Goldman wanted to exit the business and put the Apple Card behind it.",

      "LONDON -- With one puff of a cigarette, a woman in Canada became a global symbol of defiance against Iran's bloody crackdown on dissent \u2014 and the world saw the flame.",
      "A video that has gone viral in recent days shows the woman \u2014 who described herself as an Iranian refugee \u2014 snapping open a lighter and setting the flame to a photo she holds. It ignites, illuminating the visage of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest cleric. Then the woman dips a cigarette into the glow, takes a quick drag \u2014 and lets what remains of the image fall to the pavement.",
      "Whether staged or a spontaneous act of defiance \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of debate \u2014 the video has become one of the defining images of the protests in Iran against the Islamic Republic\u2019s ailing economy, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military action in the country again.",
      "The gesture has jumped from the virtual world to the real one, with opponents of the regime lighting cigarettes on photos of the ayatollah from Israel to Germany and Switzerland to the United States.",
      "In the 34 seconds of footage, many across platforms like X, Instagram and Reddit saw one person defy a series of the theocracy\u2019s laws and norms in a riveting act of autonomy. She wears no hijab, three years after the \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests against the regime\u2019s required headscarves.",
      "She burns an image of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, a crime in the Islamic republic punishable by death. Her curly hair cascades \u2014 yet another transgression in the Iranian government\u2019s eyes. She lights a cigarette from the flame \u2014 a gesture considered immodest in Iran.",
      "And in those few seconds, circulated and amplified a million times over, she steps into history.",
      "In 2026, social media is a central battleground for narrative control over conflicts. Protesters in Iran say the unrest is a demonstration against the regime\u2019s strictures and competence. Iran has long cast it as a plot by outsiders like United States and Israel to destabilize the Islamic Republic.",
      "And both sides are racing to tell the story of it that will endure.",
      "Iranian state media announces wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls \u201cterrorists\u201d and also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. There was evidence on Thursday that the regime\u2019s bloody crackdown had somewhat smothered the dissent after activists said it had killed at least 2,615 people. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the mayhem of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Social media has bloomed with photos of people lighting cigarettes from photos of Iran\u2019s leader. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em. #Iran,\u201d posted Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana.",
      "In the age of AI, misinformation and disinformation, there\u2019s abundant reason to question emotionally and politically charged images. So when \u201cthe cigarette girl\u201d appeared online this month, plenty of users did just that.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear, for example, whether she was lighting up inside Iran or somewhere with free-speech protections as a sign of solidarity. Some spotted a background that seemed to be in Canada. She confirmed that in interviews. But did her collar line up correctly? Was the flame realistic? Would a real woman let her hair get so close to the fire?",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Elon Musk's AI assistant, Grok, is facing scrutiny from governments worldwide",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's Grok keeps getting into trouble, and this time, more of the world's governments are trying to intervene.",
      "First launched in 2023, Grok is Musk\u2019s attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in building an AI assistant powered by a large language model, which is trained on vast pools of data to help predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. It's the main product of Musk's AI startup, xAI, which has been merged with his social media platform, X. Much like ChatGPT and Gemini, Musk's company has also folded AI image generation capabilities into the chatbot.",
      "Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics have repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, such as last year when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk\u2019s X social media platform. The chatbot was also found last year to be echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it would sometimes search online for Musk\u2019s stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "Beyond politics, Musk's vision of himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d has led to his company's more lax approach to sexualized images. Other mainstream chatbots block the creation of pornographic images. OpenAI had originally planned to enable ChatGPT to engage in \u201cerotica for verified adults,\u201d starting last month, but it has not done so.",
      "Here are some of the more recent controversies Grok has been involved in:",
      "Grok has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others, with requests such as \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "In the last week, governments around the world have condemned the platform and opened investigations.",
      "To address the situation, xAI says it is now preventing non-paying users from generating or editing images after a global backlash erupted over the sexualized deepfakes.",
      "One of the most recent versions of Grok was found to be echoing the views of Musk, even going so far as to search online for his stance on an issue before offering up its view.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, released in July, surprised some experts.",
      "In one example widely shared on social media and duplicated by a researcher, Grok was asked to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot sought out his guidance anyway.",
      "The chatbot told independent researcher Simon Willison that \u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "After Grok allegedly disseminated content insulting to Turkey\u2019s president and other Turkish figures, a court ordered a ban on accessing the platform last year.",
      "The chatbot posted vulgarities against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and personalities in response to user questions on X, a pro-government news channel reported. Offensive responses were also directed at modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, according to other media outlets.",

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to boost production of rare earths and the other critical minerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China's grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House\u2019s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.",
      "The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world's critical minerals. To break Beijing's chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China's playbook instead of a Republican administration.",
      "The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.",
      "Shaheen called the legislation \u201ca historic investment\u201d to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China\u2019s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is \u201ca much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.\u201d",
      "When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.",
      "On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone \u201cdeployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments\u201d to close six critical minerals deals that will \u201chelp free the United States from market manipulation.\u201d",
      "One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country's last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.",
      "Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country's only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.",
      "The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.",
      "\u201cDespite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,\u201d wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be \u201ca prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.\u201d",

That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.",

      "In China, the names of things are often either ornately poetic or stunningly direct",
      "BEIJING -- In China, the names of things are often either ornately poetic or jarringly direct. A new, wildly popular app among young Chinese people is definitively the latter.",
      "It's called, simply, \u201cAre You Dead?\"",
      "In a vast country whose young people are increasingly on the move, the new, one-button app \u2014 which has taken the country by digital storm this month \u2014 is essentially exactly what it says it is. People who live alone in far-off cities and may be at risk \u2014 or just perceived as such by friends or relatives \u2014 can push an outsized green circle on their phone screens and send proof of life over the network to a friend or loved one. The cost: 8 yuan (about $1.10).",
      "It's simple and straightforward \u2014 essentially a 21st-century Chinese digital version of those American pendants with an alert button on them for senior citizens that gave birth to the famed TV commercial: \u201cI've fallen, and I can't get up!\u201d",
      "Developed by three young people in their 20s, \u201cAre You Dead?\u201d became the most downloaded paid app on the Apple App Store in China last week, according to local media reports. It is also becoming a top download in places as diverse as Singapore and the Netherlands, Britain and India and the United States \u2014 in line with the developers' attitude that loneliness and safety aren't just Chinese issues.",
      "\u201cEvery country has young people who move to big cities to chase their dreams,\u201d Ian L\u00fc, 29, one of the app's developers, said Thursday.",
      "L\u00fc, who worked and lived alone in the southern city of Shenzhen for five years, experienced such loneliness himself. He said the need for a frictionless check-in is especially strong among introverts. \u201cIt's unrealistic,\u201d he said, \u201cto message people every day just to tell them you're still alive.\u201d",
      "Against the backdrop of modern and increasingly frenetic Chinese life, the market for the app is understandable.",
      "Traditionally, Chinese families have tended to live together or at least in close proximity across generations \u2014 something embedded deep in the nation's culture until recent years. That has changed in the last few decades with urbanization and rapid economic growth that have sent many Chinese to join what is effectively a diaspora within their own nation \u2014 and taken hundreds of millions far from parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.",
      "Today, the country has more than 100 million households with only one person, according to an annual report from the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2024.",
      "Consider Chen Xingyu, 32, who has lived on her own for years in Kunming, the capital of southern China\u2019s Yunnan province. \u201cIt is new and funny. The name \u2019Are You Dead?' is very interesting,\u201d Chen said.",
      "Chen, a \u201clying flat\u201d practitioner who has rejected the grueling, fast-paced career of many in her age group, would try the app but worries about data security. \u201cAssuming many who want to try are women users, if information of such detail about users gets leaked, that\u2019d be terrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Yuan Sangsang, a Shanghai designer, has been living on her own for a decade and describes herself as a \u201csingle cow and horse.\u201d She's not hoping the app will save her life \u2014 only help her relatives in the event that she does, in fact, expire alone.",

      "The commentary, by writer He Tao, went further in analyzing the cultural landscape. He wrote that the app's immediate success \u201cserves as a darkly humorous social metaphor, reminding us to pay attention to the living conditions and inner world of contemporary young people. Those who downloaded it clearly need more than just a functional security measure; they crave a signal of being seen and understood.\u201d",
      "Death is a taboo subject in Chinese culture, and the word itself is shunned to the point where many buildings in China have no fourth floor because the word for \u201cfour\u201d and the word for \u201cdeath\u201d sound the same \u2014 \u201csi.\u201d L\u00fc acknowledged that the app's name sparked public pressure.",

      "Then, a twist: Late Wednesday, the app team posted on its Weibo account that workshopping the name Demumu didn\u2019t turn out \u201cas well as expected.\u201d The app team is offering a reward for whoever offers a new name that will be picked this weekend. L\u00fc said more than 10,000 people have weighed in.",

      "An astronaut in need of medical care is on the way back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- An astronaut in need of doctors' care departed the International Space Station with three crewmates on Wednesday in NASA's first medical evacuation.",
      "The four returning astronauts \u2014 from the U.S., Russia and Japan \u2014 are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.",
      "\u201cOur timing of this departure is unexpected,\u201d NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, \u201cbut what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Officials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.",
      "The ailing astronaut is \u201cstable, safe and well cared for,\u201d outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. \u201cThis was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists.\"",
      "Launched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan\u2019s Kimiya Yui and Russia\u2019s Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day\u2019s spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew\u2019s early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.",
      "NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight\u2019s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.",
      "One U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.",
      "Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country\u2019s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.",
      "It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian Air Force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing\u2019s capsule problems.",
      "Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA\u2019s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.",

      "NASA officials had said it was riskier to leave the astronaut in space without proper medical attention for another month than to temporarily reduce the size of the space station crew by more than half. Until SpaceX delivers another crew, NASA said it will have to stand down from any routine or even emergency spacewalks, a two-person job requiring backup help from crew inside the orbiting complex.",

      "\u201cI'm very happy personally that AI models are training on Wikipedia data because it\u2019s human curated,\" Wales told The Associated Press in an interview. \"I wouldn\u2019t really want to use an AI that\u2019s trained only on X, you know, like a very angry AI,\u201d Wales said, referring to billionaire Elon Musk's social media platform.",

      "Other genres that saw an uptick? Rock grew 6.4% and Latin grew 5.2%.",

      "BANGKOK -- Iranian demonstrators' ability to get details of bloody nationwide protests out to the world has been given a strong boost, with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service dropping its fees to allow more people to circumvent the Tehran government's strongest attempt ever to prevent information from spilling outside its borders, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The move by the American aerospace company run by Elon Musk follows the complete shutdown of telecommunications and internet access to Iran's 85 million people on Jan. 8, as protests expanded over the Islamic Republic's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency.",

      "\u201cThat showed a few hundred bodies on the ground, that came out because of Starlink,\" he said in an interview from Los Angeles. \"I think that those videos from the center pretty much changed everyone's understanding of what's happening because they saw it with their own eyes.\u201d",

      "Since then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organization that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.",
      "Starlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.",
      "After efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \u201cextreme tactics\u201d now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.",
      "Security services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\u201d said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism. \u201cThe government is using every tool in its toolbox.\u201d",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",

      "The measure's lead proponent, the Service Employees International Union, sees the threat of an exodus as exaggerated.",
      "The tax is a \u201cworkable response to a crisis created by Congress,\u201d Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, said in a statement. She added that it would \u201ckeep emergency rooms open, hospitals staffed and health care systems functioning.\u201d",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians made phone calls abroad for the first time in days Tuesday after authorities severed communications during a crackdown on nationwide protests that activists say killed at least 646 people, giving a glimpse of life after being cut off from the outside world.",
      "Witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people remain concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of strikes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could possibly use the military to defend peaceful protesters. Trump also has said Iran wants to negotiate with Washington.",
      "\u201cMy customers talk about Trump\u2019s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concerns for his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.\u201d",

      "Several people in Tehran were able to call The Associated Press on Tuesday morning and speak to a journalist there. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was unable to call those numbers back. The witnesses said text messaging still was down and that internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.",
      "Anti-riot police officers, wearing helmets and body armor, carried batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, the witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who similarly carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces as well.",
      "Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, they said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, the witnesses added.",
      "However, shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began Dec. 28, was to open Tuesday. However, a witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said the security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media had not acknowledged that order.",
      "The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes. While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in their homes and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.",
      "On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.",
      "State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free \u2014 a signal some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.\u201d",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump\u2019s threats have drawn bipartisan concern in Washington.",
      "Republican Rep. Michael McCaul warned on Sunday that any U.S. military intervention to obtain Greenland would put America at odds with its NATO allies -- and possibly spell the end of the alliance itself.",
      "\"What do you make of what's going on with the president in Greenland? And now he's slapped tariffs on eight of our allies in Europe; he's not ruling out military force to get Greenland. What is going on?\" \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl asked McCaul, who serves as chairman emeritus of both the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees.",
      "While McCaul acknowledged the strategic importance of the autonomous island, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and noted that previous Presidents have considered acquiring the territory, he said the U.S. already has a treaty that allows \"full access\" to protect Greenland -- effectively negating the purpose of any invasion.",
      "\"The fact is, the president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat,\" McCaul said. \"So if he wants to purchase Greenland, that's one thing. But for him to militarily invade would turn Article 5 of NATO on its very head and, in essence, press a war with NATO itself. It would end up abolishing NATO as we know it.\"",
      "McCaul added, \"If we want to put more military in there, we can; we don't have to invade it. If he wants to buy it, that's fine. But I don't see a willing seller right now.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen echoed McCaul's point on \"This Week,\" and accused the president of \"lying\" when he says obtaining Greenland is about national security.",
      "\"Denmark and Greenland have both said to the United States, 'You can take what measures you need to protect the security of the United States and, of course, the NATO alliance,'\" Van Hollen said. \"We have a base there already, and we can expand that base.\"",
      "\"This is not about security,\" Van Hollen told Karl. \"This is about a land grab. Donald Trump wants to get his hands on the minerals and other resources of Greenland, just like the real reason he went into Venezuela had nothing to do with stopping drugs from coming.\"",

We saw that just this past week, where two Republican senators who had voted in favor of moving forward the War Powers Resolution on Venezuela backed off. So they have to stop giving Donald Trump a blank check.\"",
      "Van Hollen also criticized Trump's threats to intervene militarily in Iran amid reports that thousands of protesters have been killed in demonstrations against the country's regime.",
      "\"I don't believe we should be using American military force to try to impose democracy on Iran,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "\"We should support the protesters,\" he added. \"But the president of United States should not suggest that we're going to come in there and provide military support to get rid of the regime.\"",

      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey defended himself and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Sunday, insisting they've \"done nothing wrong\" amid what sources say is a new federal investigation targeting the two Democratic officials.",
      "\"If the rumors are true, this is deeply concerning, because this is way more important than just me. This is a very serious matter, and this whole investigation would ultimately be the product of one of the most basic foundational responsibilities that I have as mayor, which is to speak on behalf of my constituents,\" Frey told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"There are other countries where you get put away for the things that you say. There are other countries where you get investigated for saying something that runs counter to what the federal government states. But in this country, it's not that way.\"",
      "Frey said his office has not received a subpoena from the Department of Justice. He said he intends to comply with the investigation.",
      "\"Look, we have done nothing wrong, so of course we will comply in it, but at the same time, we need to be understanding how wild this is. We are doing everything possible right now to keep people safe in our city. We have spoken out to make sure that our residents are protected and people's constitutional rights are upheld. Speaking out in that way is not illegality,\" Frey said.",
      "ABC News reported Friday night that the Justice Department was investigating whether Frey and Walz have been obstructing federal law enforcement activities in the state, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "In response, Walz accused the administration of \"weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents.\"",
      "Without directly confirming the investigation, shortly after news broke Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X, \"A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.\"",
      "In a separate interview on \"This Week,\" Rep. Michael McCaul -- a Republican member and former chair of the House Homeland Security Committee -- said that investigating political leaders like this is \"uncommon.\"",
      "\"It's a federal offense to impede a federal investigation like we're seeing in the streets right now. I think that is very uncommon to go after political figures like that. I think it may be more of a statement more than anything else. But you know, we'll see,\" the Texas lawmaker said.",
      "Frey and Walz have clashed with the Trump administration in recent weeks. Up to 3,000 federal agents have been surged to Minnesota to conduct immigration enforcement operations and investigate fraud allegations. Those agents have been met by protesters demanding they cease operations and leave the state.",
      "On Jan. 7, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Minneapolis resident Renee Good, a mother of three. The deadly altercation prompted outrage from residents, local officials and Democratic lawmakers, as well as continued protests, which have been mostly peaceful.

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of taking possession of Greenland",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.",
      "They gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.",
      "But it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO \u2014 a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe \u2014 and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.",
      "\u201cWhen the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.",
      "The Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to \u201cbring the temperature down a bit,\u201d he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.",
      "Yet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.",
      "Trump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems \u201cthe need to ACQUIRE is especially important.\u201d",
      "Key Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.",
      "Tillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans \u201cbad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America\u2019s allies.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that \u201cthere\u2019s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.\u201d",
      "In a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would \u201cshatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.",
      "Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.",
      "In a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.",
      "Trump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.",
      "Murkowski said on social media that \u201cour NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin\u2019s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.",

Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.",
      "Democrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.",
      "Still, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "That argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.",

Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff.",

      "WASHINGTON -- There is broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate for reviving federal health care subsidies that expired at the beginning of the year. But long-standing disagreements over abortion coverage are threatening to block any compromise and leave millions of Americans with higher premiums.",
      "Despite significant progress, bipartisan Senate negotiations on the subsidies seemed to be near collapse at the end of the week as the abortion dispute appears intractable.",
      "\u201cOnce we get past this issue, there\u2019s decent agreement on everything else,\u201d Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who has led the talks, told reporters.",
      "But movement was hard to find.",
      "Republicans were seeking stronger curbs on abortion coverage for those who purchase insurance off the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. Democrats strongly opposed any such changes, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022. And advocacy groups on both sides were pushing against any compromise that they believe would weaken their positions.",
      "The impasse was a familiar obstacle for lawmakers who have been arguing over the health law, known widely as \u201cObamacare,\u201d since it was passed 16 years ago.",
      "\u201cThe two sides are passionate about (abortion) so I think if they can find a way to bring it up, they probably will,\u201d said Ivette Gomez, a senior policy analyst on women\u2019s health policy for KFF, the health care research nonprofit.",
      "The abortion dispute dates back to the weeks and months before President Barack Obama signed the health overhaul into law in 2010, when Democrats who controlled Congress added provisions ensuring that federal dollars subsidizing the health plans would not pay for elective abortions. The compromise came after negotiations with members of their own party whose opposition to abortion rights threatened to sink the legislation.",
      "The final language allowed states to offer plans under the ACA that cover elective abortions, but said that federal money could not pay for them. States are now required to segregate funding for those procedures.",
      "Since then, 25 states have passed laws prohibiting abortion coverage in ACA plans, 12 have passed laws requiring abortion coverage in the plans and 13 states and the District of Columbia have no coverage limitations or requirements, according to KFF. Some Republicans and anti-abortion groups now want to make it harder for the states that require or allow the coverage, arguing that the segregated funds are nothing more than a gimmick that allows taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions.",
      "Senators involved in the negotiations said a potential compromise was to investigate some of those states to ensure that they are segregating the money correctly.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who has led the negotiations with Moreno, said \u201cthe answer is to audit\u201d those states and enforce the law if they are not properly segregating their funds.",
      "But that plan was unlikely to win unanimity from Republicans, and Democrats have not signed on.",
      "Negotiators were more optimistic last week, after President Donald Trump told House Republicans at a meeting that \u201cyou have to be a little flexible\u201d on rules that federal dollars cannot be used for abortions.",
      "Those words from the president, who has said little about whether he wants Congress to extend the subsidies, came just before a House vote on Democratic legislation that would extend the ACA tax credits for three years. After his comments, 17 Republicans voted with Democrats on the extension over the objections of GOP leadership and the House passed the bill with no new abortion restrictions.",

They have been focused on extending the COVID-era subsidies that expired on Jan. 1 and had kept costs down for millions of people in the United States. The average subsidized enrollee is facing more than double the monthly premium costs for 2026, also according to KFF.",
      "The two sides have been haggling since the fall, when Democrats voted to shut down the government for 43 days as they demanded negotiations on extending the subsidies. Republicans refused to negotiate until a small group of moderate Democrats agreed to vote with them and end the shutdown.",
      "After the shutdown ended, Republicans made clear that they would not budge on the subsidies without changes on abortion, and the Senate voted on and rejected a three-year extension of the tax credits.",

The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.",
      "Since tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are \u201c top secret.\u201d",
      "Following the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of \u201cmaking cocaine and selling it to the United States\u201d and said U.S intervention in that country \u201csounds good to me.\u201d After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that \u201cthe situation of drugs and other disagreements\u201d had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is \u201crun\u201d by drug cartels and says, \u201cYou have to do something with Mexico.\u201d He's warned Iran that if that country starts \u201ckilling people like they have in the past\u201d during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then \u201cthey are going to get hit very hard by the United States.\u201d Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.",
      "Trump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba \u201conly survives because of Venezuela\u201d and is \u201cready to fall\u201d without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba \u201cmake a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,\u201d without saying what that means.",
      "Trump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program \u2014 a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time \u2014 to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.",
      "Trump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall\u2019s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.",
      "The fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three \u201cRush Hour\u201d films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

      "Midsize cities across the U.S. are increasingly converting one-way streets to two-way routes",
      "Excessive speeding was so common on parallel one-way streets passing a massive electronics plant that Indianapolis residents used to refer to the pair as a \u201cracetrack\u201d akin to the city's famous Motor Speedway a few miles west.",
      "Originally two-way thoroughfares, Michigan and New York streets switched to opposite one-way routes in the 1970s to help thousands of RCA workers swiftly travel to and from their shifts building televisions or pressing vinyl records. But after the RCA plant closed in 1995, the suddenly barren roads grew even more enticing for lead-footed drivers \u2014 until last year, when city officials finally converted them back to two-way streets.",
      "\u201cThe opening and conversion of those streets has just been transformative for how people think about that corridor,\u201d said James Taylor, who runs a nearby community center.",
      "Embracing the oft-repeated slogan that \u201cpaint is cheap,\u201d transportation planners across the U.S. \u2014 particularly in midsize cities \u2014 have been turning their unidirectional streets back to multidirectional ones. They view the step as one of the easiest ways to improve safety and make downtowns more alluring to shoppers, restaurant patrons and would-be residents.",
      "Dave Amos, an assistant professor of city and regional planning at California Polytechnic State University, said almost no major streets in the U.S. originated as one-way routes. Two-way streets were the standard, before mass migration to the suburbs prioritized faster commutes over downtown walkability.",
      "\u201cOne-way streets are designed for moving cars quickly and efficiently,\u201d Amos said. \u201cSo when you have that as your goal, pedestrians and cyclists almost by design are secondary, which makes them more vulnerable.\u201d",
      "But the propensity to speed isn\u2019t the only reason one-way streets are viewed as less safe.",
      "Wade Walker, an engineer with Kittelson & Associates who has worked on street conversion projects in Lakeland, Florida; Lynchburg, Virginia; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, said there is a misperception that one-way streets are safer because people on foot only have to look one direction to see the incoming traffic. The confusion arises when one-way streets combine with two-way streets to form a city grid, he said.",
      "Pedestrians crossing a signalized intersection of two-way streets can expect to encounter vehicles in a certain sequence: those turning left on green, traveling straight, and turning right on red. But when one-way streets are included, there are 16 potential sequences depending on the type and direction of the roads that intersect, Walker said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the number of conflicts, it\u2019s the way those conflicts occur,\u201d he said.",
      "Louisville, Kentucky, about two hours south of Indianapolis, has been restoring one-way streets to their original two-way footprints. The state is leading an ongoing project to reconvert a stretch along Main Street that passes such landmarks as the Louisville Slugger Museum, the KFC Yum! Center arena, and a minor-league baseball stadium.",
      "One of the city's biggest redesigns is happening this year in the predominantly Black western part of the city, where many roads changed to one-way routes in the 1970s to feed a new interstate bridge over the Ohio River. However, it decimated neighborhoods and cut off the once-thriving community from downtown.",
      "\u201cAll those mom-and-pop shops and local businesses over time kind of faded because that connectivity got taken away,\u201d said Michael King, the city's assistant director of transportation planning. \u201cIt just feels more like, \u2018This is a road to get me through here pretty quickly.\u2019\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Work starts around sunrise for the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear streaming out of a bland office building near the main airport.",
      "Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs.",
      "Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices. \u201cGo home!\u201d they shout as convoys roar past. \"ICE out!\u201d",
      "Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201d a woman shouted on a recent morning. \u201cWe\u2019re here until you leave.\u201d",
      "This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, the Trump administration's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.",
      "The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. And even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.",
      "Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t use the word \u2018invasion\u2019 lightly,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, noting that his police force has just 600 officers. \u201cWhat we are seeing is thousands \u2014 plural, thousands \u2014 of federal agents coming into our city.\u201d",

      "It can take hours to drive across Los Angeles and Chicago, both targets of Trump administration crackdowns. It can take 15 minutes to cross Minneapolis.",
      "So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.",
      "Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.",
      "At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of \u201ccurrent conditions.\u201d",
      "A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city\u2019s large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn, \u201cNo ICE enter without court order.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.",
      "Floyd was killed just blocks from where an Immigration and Citizenship Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good \u201cweaponized\u201d her vehicle.

      "But angry clashes now flare regularly across the Twin Cities. Some protesters clearly want to provoke the federal officers, throwing snowballs at them or screaming obscenities through bullhorns from just a couple feet away. The serious force, though, comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. And most clashes end in tear gas.",
      "Drivers in Minneapolis or St. Paul can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.",
      "In a state that prides itself on its decency, there\u2019s something particularly Minnesotan about the protests,",
      "Soon after Good was shot, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.",
      "\u201cIt might be shoveling your neighbor\u2019s walk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven\u2019t talked to before.\u201d",
      "He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.",
      "And when protests do become clashes, residents will often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.",
      "Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they're picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.",
      "On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in St. Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group\u2019s outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.",
      "Sometimes, people don\u2019t even understand what has happened to them.",
      "Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it's because he looks Hispanic.",
      "They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.",
      "Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he\u2019d wait for the police. Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.",
      "So the officers left.",
      "They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.",
      "Long after the officers were gone he had one final question.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for my car?\u201d",

      "A judge ruled Friday that Tennessee prison officials must grant expanded access to media members to view state-run executions, after a coalition of news organizations including The Associated Press sued on claims that state execution protocols unconstitutionally limit thorough and accurate reporting.",
      "Before Chancellor I'Ashea L. Myles' order, reporters witnessing lethal injections were limited to a short time period during which they could view the execution process.

      "The lawsuit sought a judgment that the protocols are unconstitutional and an injunction to allow the press to see the full execution process. Myles' order granted a temporary injunction allowing media members and other witnesses to see most of the execution process, with security procedures in place for those carrying out the procedures.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville, names as defendants Kenneth Nelsen, warden of Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville that houses Tennessee\u2019s execution chamber, and Frank Strada, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after hours Friday to a department spokesperson.",

      "The protocol says that after the syringes of saline and pentobarbital are administered, a team leader signals to the warden and a five-minute waiting period begins. After that period, the blinds are closed, the camera is turned off and then the doctor comes in to determine if the person is dead. If that is the case, the warden announces on the intercom system that the sentence was carried out and witnesses are directed to exit.",

      "The complaint, filed by state Attorney General Matthew Platkin and the office's Division on Civil Rights, names former Clark Mayor Sal Bonaccorso, suspended town police chief Pedro Matos and the current police director Patrick Grady as defendants. It claims the town's leaders \u201csystematically discriminated against and harassed Black and other non-white motorists.\u201d",
      "Bonaccorso, a Republican, was the town's mayor for about 25 years before he resigned in January 2025, just days after starting his seventh term in office.

He left office after pleading guilty to using township resources to benefit his private landscaping business and forging signatures on permit applications for work his company performed in the area.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:11:15 -0500",
    "summary": "As a young boy, Judd Apatow says he wanted to grow up to be like the director of such classics as \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" Now Apatow has co-directed a two-part HBO Max documentary about his idol: \"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\"",
    "story": [
      "At the Golden Globes last week, Judd Apatow cracked up the room: \"I'm very honored to be asked to present the award for best director, because I'm pretty sure that means the Globes people think I'm also one of the best directors.\"",
      "But Apatow is more at home behind the camera, as a director of comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\" and of documentaries about some of his idols, like comedians Garry Shandling and George Carlin.",
      "His latest subject hardly needs an introduction.",
      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",
      "In the documentary, Brooks described his wartime experience:",
      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right. Forty-five degree angle with your bayonet, go through the soil, find, find, find, dink dink. Oh, oh!\"",
      "\"I said to him, you know, \"Did you ever think that you were gonna die?'\" Apatow recalled. \"And he goes, 'Only every second of every day.'\"",
      "Brooks came home from the war, but he never really stopped fighting the Nazis \u2013 lampooning them in \"The Producers,\" \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and \"History of the World Part I.\"",
      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

      "He's recognizable from any number of roles over the decades, from Hollywood blockbusters (\"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\"), popular streaming shows (\"Andor\"), European art-house fare (\"Breaking the Waves\"), and even an ABBA musical.",

      "In the film, he plays a father of two. In real life he's the father of eight. All live nearby, and all have worked in the film industry, five of them actors. \"It's insane,\" he said of the \"family business.\" \"I mean, what is the chance? I didn't encourage them.

    "summary": "Another allegation against Busfield was reported to law enforcement the same day he turned himself in, according to a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield made his first court appearance on Wednesday, a day after turning himself in to authorities to face charges of child sex abuse stemming from allegations that he inappropriately touched a minor on the set of a TV series he was directing in New Mexico.",
      "Busfield was ordered held without bond. He appeared remotely via a video link from jail. Whether he remains in jail will be the subject of a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "During Wednesday's brief court appearance, Busfield stood silent and expressionless, dressed in orange prison clothes, while a defense attorney spoke on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield allegedly touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

    "summary": "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat.",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",

      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",
      "\"Any changes to the ACA tax credits mid-year would complicate the logistics and slow down the reopening of enrollment and the premium relief,\" he said in a post.",

That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",

      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",

      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",

      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "As the president prepares to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he's made no secret of his goal for lower interest rates \u2014 but there are a few political roadblocks in the way.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump prepares to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming months, he hasn't been shy about his goal for the powerful economic posting: lower interest rates.",
      "\"I want somebody that when the market is doing great, interest rates can go down because our country becomes stronger,\" the president said during a speech in Detroit on Tuesday. He's long pushed for lower rates, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow.",
      "He has also made no secret of his frustration with outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has supported cutting interest rates at a fairly slow clip, wary of causing inflation to resurge. For months, Mr. Trump has called Powell \u2014 whom the president appointed Fed chief during his first term \u2014 a \"moron,\" a \"stubborn mule,\" a \"real stiff\" and \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "And then, in a surprising Sunday night video message, Powell announced the Fed had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department \"threatening a criminal indictment\" over Powell's testimony to Congress about a pricey renovation to the Fed's headquarters. He accused the administration of using the renovation cost overruns and his testimony as \"pretexts.\" He also argued the independence of the Fed, which operates separately from the executive branch and isn't funded by tax dollars, is at risk.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said, asserting that this threat \"is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"",
      "The White House says Mr. Trump didn't direct the Justice Department to issue subpoenas, and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro has insisted the subpoenas were \"not a threat,\" but were instead issued because the Fed wasn't answering questions. In an interview with CBS News, Mr. Trump brushed off allegations of political retribution, saying: \"I can't help what it looks like.\"",
      "But the subpoenas have outraged some Republican lawmakers, jeopardizing Mr. Trump's plan to immediately nominate a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May.",
      "That congressional pushback is just the latest roadblock in Mr. Trump's quest to get the Fed to cut rates. There's also the looming possibility that Powell could remain on the Federal Reserve's board even after his term as chair ends. And ultimately, the decisions on interest rates are made by a committee that's largely out of the president's reach.",
      "\"As we learned this week, [Mr. Trump] may not have as much freedom to pick a Fed chair as he thought,\" David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, told CBS News.",
      "New Fed chair will need to get through a skeptical Senate",
      "Mr. Trump has identified two leading candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed board member Kevin Warsh.",
      "\"The two Kevins are very good,\" the president told Reuters.",
      "But the next chair will need to be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 and there are signs the Justice Department's investigation into Powell could complicate things, as several GOP lawmakers have raised concerns that the Fed's delicate independence may be at risk.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina reacted furiously to the Powell probe, writing on X that Trump advisers were \"actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" Tillis wrote just hours after Powell publicly announced the subpoenas.",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, and if he were to vote with the panel's Democrats to oppose Mr. Trump's nominee, the committee would deadlock 12-12.",
      "Any nominee who makes it to the full Senate could face skepticism from several other Senate Republicans. In the current Senate, Mr. Trump can afford to lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats vote against his Federal Reserve pick.",
      "Among the GOP skeptics: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Powell's video revealing the subpoenas raised \"a lot of disturbing questions,\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she sees the investigation as a bid to \"intimidate, threaten and coerce.\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he thinks it's unlikely that Powell did anything wrong and warned the conflict between Mr. Trump and the Fed chief could be economically damaging.",
      "\"If you wanted to design a system to cause interest rates to go up and not down, you would have the Federal Reserve of the United States and the executive branch of the United States get into a pissing contest. We don't need it,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has the ability to bypass a deadlocked Banking Committee and enable a nominee to reach the floor for a vote, acknowledged to reporters Monday that the investigation could make it challenging to confirm new nominees to the Fed.",
      "\"If the Justice Department is pursuing something, I hope they have a smoking gun or something, because I don't think you trifle with the Federal Reserve,\" the South Dakota Republican said Tuesday.",
      "What if Powell doesn't step down?",
      "Another possible wrinkle: Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, but his term as a rank-and-file member of the Fed's Board of Governors doesn't end for another two years.",
      "All seven members of the board serve 14-year terms, but the board's chair serves a separate four-year term. In recent history, most Fed chairs have resigned from the board altogether when their time as boss runs out, but there's nothing requiring them to do so.",
      "Powell has served on the Fed since 2012. He was nominated to a 14-year term by former President Barack Obama two years later, was elevated to chair during Mr. Trump's first term and was nominated to a second term as chair by former President Joe Biden. The 72-year-old Powell hasn't said whether he plans to leave the Fed when his term as chair expires.",
      "Murkowski told reporters Monday that if the goal of the scrutiny on Powell is to get him to speed up his departure from the Fed, it could have the opposite effect.",
      "\"When you get pressured, when you get threatened in this way, most of us would say, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" she said.",
      "Wessel told CBS News he doesn't think Powell is likely to stay on the Fed board, but said: \"I do think there's a possibility, and I think the possibility went up over the last week.\"",
      "If Powell decides to stick around until his term ends in January 2028, it could cause a few problems for Mr. Trump's push for a Fed that aligns with his views on interest rates.",
      "Because the new Fed chair must be selected from among the existing seven Fed governors, there needs to be a vacancy on the board in order for Mr. Trump to appoint a new person as chair. If Powell doesn't create a vacancy by resigning, the president would likely need to nominate his chair to the board seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran.",
      "A Trump economic adviser, Miran was confirmed to a short-term posting on the Fed board last year after a Biden-nominated governor resigned before her term expired. His term as a Fed governor ends on Jan. 31, but it's not clear if Mr. Trump had planned to nominate him to a fresh 14-year term after that. (If a successor to Miran isn't nominated when his current term ends, he can remain in place until the Senate confirms a replacement, under federal law.)",
      "If Mr. Trump replaces Miran with his handpicked Fed chair and Powell remains on the board, only three of the Fed's seven governors would be Trump nominees: the chair, plus two officials who were initially appointed during Mr. Trump's first term, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller.",
      "That could increase to four Trump nominees out of seven after Powell's term ends in 2028. But the three remaining governors \u2014 all Biden nominees \u2014 have terms that end in 2032 or later, keeping them on the Fed until well after Mr. Trump leaves office unless they choose to resign.",
      "Chair doesn't set interest rates on his own",
      "The composition of the Fed's rank-and-file board members matters for Mr. Trump because, when it comes to interest rate-setting decisions, the chair is technically one vote out of a dozen.",
      "Interest rate policy is overseen by a 12-member panel called the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of all seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating cast of four of the other 11 regional Fed bank chiefs.",
      "Mr. Trump has very little control over the regional Fed presidents who sit on the committee. They're hired for five-year terms by each regional bank's board of directors, and while the Fed's Board of Governors needs to approve their appointments, the board voted unanimously to extend most sitting regional bank presidents' terms until 2031 last month. Wessel said the board can fire presidents.",
      "So, depending on whether Powell stays on the Fed, either three or four of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members are set to be Trump nominees.",
      "When the committee meets eight times a year to set interest rate targets, the Fed chair traditionally plays a key role in helping the panel form consensus, but the members vote on their own. It's not uncommon for members to dissent from the committee's decisions, and there's no guarantee that their views will align with Mr. Trump's.",
      "\"If they don't respect the chairman, and the chairman bows to pressure from Trump and wants to do a deep interest rate cut that the other members of the committee think is nuts, they will vote against it,\" Wessel said.",
      "Dissents have been commonplace in recent months. When the committee voted to leave rates flat in July, Bowman and Waller pushed for a rate cut \u2014 but their stance hinged on a belief that the economy is softening, not that it's extremely strong as Mr. Trump argues. And in December, when the committee voted to cut rates by 0.25 points, Miran dissented and called for a larger 0.5-point cut, while two regional presidents favored no cut at all.",
      "And if Powell stays on as a Fed governor, Wessell said he could have \"considerable influence,\" too.",
      "Can Trump fire Fed officials?",
      "Mr. Trump is fighting in court for an extra board seat \u2014 and for more power to shape the board.",
      "Over the summer, the president attempted to fire board member Lisa Cook, accusing the Biden nominee of making false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "The dramatic move posed the first-ever test of a president's power to fire Fed members. Under federal law, the president can only remove board members \"for cause,\" a term that isn't defined.",
      "Cook has sued over the firing, arguing that an \"unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications\" doesn't meet the law's requirement for cause. But the Trump administration has argued the president acted within his power.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in Cook's case on Jan. 21. The courts have let Cook remain in her job \u2014 and vote on interest rate policy \u2014 while the lawsuit plays out, but the federal government is asking the Supreme Court to allow her to be removed for the time being.",
      "It's not clear how the high court might rule. In a separate case that's also set to be decided this term, the Supreme Court appears to be leaning toward giving the president more power to fire members of independent government agencies without cause. But the court has hinted in the past that it views the Federal Reserve as special.",
      "In an order last year that let Mr. Trump fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court explicitly said that the Fed wouldn't be impacted, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "The case could have broad implications for whether the Fed remains independent.",
      "Mr. Trump has long argued that he should have some input in the Fed's interest rate-setting decisions, saying last month that \"my voice should be heard\" because of his business background.",
      "But many experts say it's essential that the Fed operate independently of political influence so that it can weigh the economy's long-term best interest, rather than accommodating politicians' short-term desire for low rates and a hot economy.",
      "\"I think the expectations are [that] the Supreme Court doesn't want to turn the Fed inside out and they're going to let [Cook] stay,\" Wessel said. \"If they didn't let her stay, that would basically be the end of the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is delaying its plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments, backing off a measure that threatened to deliver a financial blow to millions of Americans.",
      "The Education Department announced Friday that involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold as the agency finalizes new repayment plans. The shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause.",
      "Nicholas Kent, the department's higher education chief, said the agency is \"committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options.\"",
      "\"The Department determined that involuntary collection efforts such as Administrative Wage Garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program will function more efficiently and fairly after the Trump Administration implements significant improvements to our broken student loan system,\" Kent said in a statement.",
      "Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans, meaning they are at least 270 days behind on payments. The penalties were put on hold during a pandemic-era pause on student loan payments that the Trump administration lifted.",
      "Last spring, Trump officials said they would resume targeting tax refunds for borrowers in default. In December, officials said they would restart wage garnishment in January, with initial notices being sent to 1,000 borrowers the week of Jan. 7.",
      "Both penalties \u2014 withholding wages and federal payments \u2014 are being paused, according to the Friday announcement.",
      "The department did not set a new date for involuntary collections. It said the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.",
      "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon indicated earlier this week that the department was planning to pause wage garnishment efforts in remarks to local reporters in Rhode Island.",
      "More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to department data. Millions more have fallen behind on loan payments and are at risk of going into default this year. Nearly 10% of borrowers were delinquent by more than 90 days in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to April 2023, and for a one-year grace period after that, borrowers who missed payments could avoid default. The Education Department announced in May that it would resume collections activity.",
      "McMahon said earlier this week that \"we had an incredible falloff in people repaying their loans\" during the pandemic-era pause.",
      "Friday's announcement was welcomed by student loan advocates who urged the department not to resume wage garnishment.",
      "\"The administration's plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the nonprofit Protect Borrowers, told the Associated Press.",
      "Congress last year ordered the department to overhaul repayment plans that critics said had become too confusing. New borrowers will have two options: a standard plan and a plan that lowers payments based on the borrower's income.",
      "Last month the department scrapped the SAVE Plan, which was created under former President Joe Biden and offered lower payments and a quicker path to student loan forgiveness. The plan had been blocked by a federal judge after Missouri and other states challenged it in court.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:23:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. Will it mean lower prices at the pump?",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. \u2014 a shipment the president valued at $500 million.",
      "It's part of the administration's push to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves, some of the largest in the world.",
      "What does that mean for U.S. drivers?",
      "Gas is currently at $2.67 a gallon nationally, the lowest it's been since May 2021. But prices have been steadily declining since last November, weeks before the U.S. military operation\u00a0that captured Venezuela's autocratic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Will Venezuelan oil push prices even lower?",
      "Economists are divided on when or how much these developments may affect consumer prices.",
      "\"If I know prices are going to be lower in the future because I expect this Venezuelan crude, that'll impact prices now,\" said Dr. Ian Lange, a professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines. He also served as a senior economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump's first term.",
      "However, others say it's too soon for Venezuela to be a factor at the pump.",
      "\"It's far too early for any measurable impact on what consumers are paying at the pump \u2014 whether prices go up or down \u2014 as it would likely take years to see a meaningful increase in oil output there,\" wrote Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, in their weekly price update.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. imported nearly 3.1 billion barrels of crude oil, and just 2.75% came from Venezuela. Even before 2019 sanctions, Venezuelan oil made up roughly 8% of yearly U.S. imports \u2014 about the same share Mexico holds today.",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied 1 to 1.8 million barrels per day to the United States. Now the country's current production caps at 750,000 barrels per day.",
      "Returning to that higher level of production, if possible, wouldn't necessarily be a good thing for the global oil supply chain.",
      "\"A big ramp-up in production from Venezuela would sort of add to an already oversupplied market,\" said Lange.",
      "In any case, that ramp-up in production hasn't happened yet.\u00a0Venezuela's oil infrastructure\u00a0has suffered from years of underinvestment, corruption and sanctions, and so far, U.S. companies appear\u00a0reluctant to invest\u00a0in rebuilding it.",
      "\"It could take years of positive developments for additional supply to meaningfully move the needle,\" said De Haan. \"The impact on U.S. gasoline prices may ultimately be limited.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Canadian crude has dominated U.S. heavy oil imports while sanctions have virtually ceased Venezuelan shipments.",
      "Canada now supplies the majority of the heavy crude that American refineries need.",
      "\"It's certainly possible that a large increase in the oil coming out of Venezuela outcompetes Canadian oil, even as most of our refineries are going to be in the Gulf Coast,\" Lange said.",
      "But Lange says Venezuela is not ready to compete in that way right now. It depends on concessions from the Venezuelan government to U.S. energy producers.",
      "Why the U.S. needs heavy crude oil",
      "The U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers. So why Import billions of barrels per year?",
      "It comes down to the type of oil. The U.S. produces mostly \"light crude,\" which is less dense and cheaper to refine. But American refineries, especially those along the Gulf Coast, are designed to process a mix of light and heavy crude.",
      "\"Most of our production of crude oil in the United States is on the light side, and most refineries need a mix of light and heavy,\" Lange said. \"Right now, we get a lot of our heavies from Canada, which may be supplemented by Venezuela in the near future.\"",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves total roughly 300 billion barrels \u2014 about 17% of the world's proven reserves. Much of it is heavy rude, exactly what Gulf Coast refineries need.",
      "If Venezuela can ramp up production, it could mean competition with Canada \u2014 and that's good for consumers, according to Lange.",
      "\"Refineries would pay less as they play the Canadians and the Venezuelans off each other,\" Lange said. \"And that would lead to a lower price of refined products for the end consumer.\"",
      "Can prices drop too low?",
      "More oil sounds good for drivers. But flooding an already oversupplied market carries risks.",
      "If crude prices fall too far, American producers start to cut back. Light crude \u2014 the kind that the U.S. produces \u2014 would become less profitable to drill. The going price for a barrel of oil, roughly 42 gallons, is just over $60.",
      "Experts caution scaling back would mean closing down refineries and cutting industry jobs in places like Texas and the Dakotas.",
      "\"If we don't import crude, we'd close a refinery. And that's not good,\" Lange said. \"That's jobs and economic activity.\"",
      "The cycle of supply and demand continues. If domestic production slows, supply tightens and prices rise again.",

      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",

      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",
      "The AI company said the ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT provides and that it will not share conversations users have with the chatbot \u2014 or their data \u2014 with advertisers.",
      "The OpenAI spokesperson did not disclose the companies it intends to advertise on ChatGPT but said the company will \"have more to share about our early partners soon.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:26:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As obesity rates among Americans drop and weight loss drugs lead to a slimmer society, airlines could save on fuel costs, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines could have weight loss drug manufacturers to thank for savings if passengers become lighter, allowing carriers to spend less money on fuel.",
      "As GLP-1 medications for weight loss become accessible to more Americans, they are expected to have a slimming down effect on society. The implication for airlines is lower fuel consumption and therefore cost savings, a recent analysis from Jefferies Research Services shows.",
      "Fuel costs are directly related to the weight of planes, including passengers, their luggage and other essential cargo. A heavier plane requires more fuel, while a lighter aircraft uses less.",
      "Airlines have always taken steps to keep aircraft as light as possible and limit fuel consumption, from serving pit-less olives to using thin or light paper stock, according to the Jefferies analysis.",
      "Airlines \"have a long history of searching for unique methods to reduce the weight of the aircraft, in turn reducing fuel consumption and limiting an airline's largest cost bucket,\" analysts said in the report.",
      "They have no ability to limit how much passengers weigh, however.",
      "If weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy lead to a 10% slimmer society, the analysts found that would translate to total airline passenger weight declining by 2%. For airlines, this means 1.5% in fuel savings, plus a 4% boost to earnings per share, according to the analysis.",
      "Jefferies used the example of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to model the savings. It weighs 99,000 pounds empty and can carry 46,000 pounds of fuel. If it seats 178 passengers with an average weight of 180 pounds, plus about 4,000 pounds of other cargo, its total takeoff weight reaches 181,200 pounds. By contrast, if passengers slim down by 10%, to weigh an average of 162 pounds, that aircraft's total weight drops to 177,996 pounds.",
      "Jefferies found that translates to $580 million in fuel savings annually for the top four carriers in the U.S. \u2014 American, Delta, Southwest and United. Those airlines are expected to spend $38.6 billion combined on jet fuel this year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-interest-rates-credit-cards-housing-affordability/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:25:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, The Hamilton Project at Brookings found in a 2023\u00a0study.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

    "summary": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.",
      "Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.",
      "Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\"Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.",
      "Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,\" China's top leader said.",
      "Carney looks to improve global governance",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \"under great strain.\"",
      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",
      "The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:05:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The increase in bankruptcy filings comes as Americans face a slate of economic pressures, from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added. Inflation has cooled since hitting a 40-year high in 2022, but prices are still rising faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Still, the process may be more common than you think: One in 10 Americans files for bankruptcy at some point during their lifetime, according to a 2025 LendingTree report.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",
      "\"There's a good chance that filings will even be higher through this year and even into next year,\" he said.",

      "The average interest rate on a conventional mortgage in the U.S. dropped to 6.06%, the lowest level in more than three years, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.",
      "A recent dip in mortgage rates has spurred homebuying activity, with purchase applications on the rise and more owners acting to refinance their loans, according to the government-sponsored enterprise.",
      "A year ago, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.04%. The last time the rate on a typical mortgage was lower was Sept. 15, 2022, when it was at 6.02%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week, dropping to 5.38% from 5.46% last week. A year ago, that average rate was at 6.27%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates began ticking down in July in anticipation of a series of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which began in September and continued last month.",
      "Although the central bank doesn't set rates for home loans, trimming its benchmark rate often points to lower inflation or softer economic growth, spurring investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Although mortgage rates are easing, homeownership remains beyond the means of many Americans.",

      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, has estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points,",
      "Home prices have also surged because of a dearth of affordable housing. The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address that shortage,\u00a0according\u00a0to Goldman Sachs.",

      "\"It's a good time to refinance, because nobody has a crystal ball to figure out what rates are going to do in the future,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Erik Schmitt, a Chase Home Lending executive, said that homeowners \"may be able to significantly reduce their monthly mortgage payment or shorten their loan term\" as borrowing costs ease.",

      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",

      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",

      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-tax-deduction-6000-impact-refund-aarp/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",

      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",

      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",

      "Verizon said Wednesday night an outage had been resolved after customers across the U.S. reported service outages, with many saying that their devices had been limited to SOS since about noon Eastern Time.",
      "\"The outage has been resolved. If customers are still having an issue, we encourage them to restart their devices to reconnect to the network,\" Verizon said at around 10:30 ET Wednesday night.",
      "The company said it would provide account credits for those who had been affected by the outage, the details of which would be \"shared directly with customers.\"",

Our teams will continue to work through the night until service is restored for all impacted customers.\"",
      "It's unclear how many customers were affected by the outage. According to Downdetector, which tracks reports and problem indicators online, more than 180,000 users reported outages at one point. Outages were reported from New York to California, according to complaints posted on the website and social media.",
      "Some T-Mobile users have also reported outages but a T-Mobile spokesperson said its network is \"operating normally and as expected.\"",

    "story": [
      "Financial technology company Bilt, whose credit cards offer customer rewards for rent and mortgage payments, introduced three new credit cards on Wednesday that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",
      "The offer, which will only apply to new purchases, comes after President Trump this week floated\u00a0a 10% ceiling on the interest rates\u00a0credit card issuers charge customers. The proposal drew immediate pushback from Citi, JP Morgan Chase and other major banks, which say it would result in some consumers losing access to credit and hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "By contrast, New York-based Bilt pounced on the opportunity to promote its cards as financial products that can help Americans facing an affordability crunch.",
      "\"This is a win for renters. This is a win for homeowners. This is a win for Americans,\" Ankur Jain, founder and CEO of Bilt, said in a statement.",
      "The privately held startup, which launched in 2019 and is now valued at more than $10 billion, partners with landlords to let cardholders earn rewards on routine transactions, like rent payments.",
      "Jain said the new credit cards are designed to meet the \"bipartisan call for a solution\" to the cost-of-living crisis facing many Americans, the Associated Press reported. If the U.S. imposes an interest rate cap, \"We'd rather be at the forefront,\" he said.",
      "Built is offering three credit card tiers capped at a 10% APR rate for 12 months.

    "summary": "The venerable retailer is seeking protection from its creditors after its $2.65 billion purchase of Nieman Marcus failed to spark growth.",
    "story": [
      "Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, according to court documents entered in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, throwing the future of the roughly century-old high-end department store chain into doubt. Saks Global is the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "Saks also said it had secured a $1.75 billion financing package and that it would keep its stores open as the bankruptcy procedure plays out.",
      "Saks recently missed a debt payment stemming from a 2024 deal by its parent company, Hudson's Bay Company, to buy\u00a0rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus\u00a0for $2.65 billion, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in late December, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Swamped by debt",
      "Hudson's Bay raised $2 billion in debt to complete the Nieman Marcus deal, while Apollo Global Management affiliates provided an additional $1.5 billion in financing. Amazon also took a minority stake in Saks to facilitate the deal.",
      "\"The debt-fueled acquisition of Neiman Marcus always made bankruptcy a likely destination for Saks Global,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData. \"The only real surprise has been the speed of the collapse, which has come barely a year after the deal closed.\"",
      "Saks also missed a more than $100 million interest payment to bondholders, according to the Journal, which said the retailer has fallen behind on payments to vendors. Some suppliers have responded by withholding shipments, leaving Saks with thinner merchandise offerings.",
      "\"The truth is that Saks Global put itself in a financially precarious position that undermined the day-to-day operations of the business. A lack of cash meant suppliers went unpaid. This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet,\" Saunders added.",
      "New York-based Saks launched in 1924, opening its first store in Manhattan, according to a historical account of the company posted on its website. The company expanded quickly between the 1970s and 1990s before it was purchased by Hudson's Bay in 2013. Saks's brands include luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman, which was acquired as part of the deal for Neiman Marcus; retailer Saks Off 5th, and home furnishings seller Horchow.",
      "8,100 store closures",
      "Saks appointed former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck as its new CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds Richard Baker, who stepped down from his role as Saks executive chairman and CEO on Jan. 13. Saks had announced\u00a0on Jan. 2 that Baker would succeed CEO Marc Metrick as chief executive.",
      "\"If there is one positive from the bankruptcy, it's that the previous management team has been cleared out,\" Saunders said. They bear responsibility for the mess, and their reputation with vendors and associates at the firm is thoroughly tarnished.\"",
      "Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, said van Raemdonck is well-suited for his new role, having previously served as CEO of Neiman Marcus, which he led through bankruptcy.",
      "\"He has a background in turning situations around, and he is familiar with Neiman Marcus, so he is a better fit,\" Hynes told CBS News.",
      "Brick-and-mortar retailers face ongoing competitive challenges from e-commerce giants like Amazon and \"fast-fashion\" sellers such as H&M and Uniqlo. More than 8,100 stores closed across the U.S. in 2025, up roughly 12% from the previous year, according to retail industry analytics firm Coresight Research.",
      "\"In general, brick-and-mortar retailers are not growing, so store closures would be somewhat positive for anybody that competes with Saks,\" Hynes said.",
      "What does this mean for shoppers?",
      "Saks Global is reorganizing, not liquidating, so its brands will remain in business for now. But analysts expect Saks to close some stores to save money on costly leases. The fate of the retailer's Fifth Avenue store remains unclear.",
      "When Saks missed payments to vendors, some brands stopped shipping new inventory, leaving its store shelves thinly stocked.",
      "\"Since Saks put in place a widely panned vendor payment plan, many vendors reduced, and as the year went on, stopped shipments to Saks,\" mergers and acquisitions attorney Jonathan Lazarow told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers can now expect the retailer to start receiving new inventory again, now that it has secured a bankruptcy loan and can resume payments to vendors.",

    "summary": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration's tariffs caused a \"few-billion-dollar impact,\" but also praised them for \"leveling the playing field.\"",
    "story": [
      "As General Motors settles into its new Detroit headquarters, the automotive industry is facing challenging times as it contends with rising costs, shifting tariff policies and a fledgling electric vehicle market. GM CEO Mary Barra tells CBS News that, despite those challenges, \"I think we're on a good path\" and she is optimistic about the future of her company and the U.S. economy.",
      "The market for electric vehicles hasn't quite taken off in the U.S. just yet. Barra told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil Tuesday that GM is \"still committed\" to EVs, but thinks a major issue is that the industry was \"getting a little ahead of the consumer.\"",
      "\"A vehicle is such a big purchase for a consumer,\" she said. \"For many of them, it's the most expensive thing that they buy.\"",
      "\"I think we're on a good path. I think as there's more charging infrastructure, as we continue to get the cost of batteries down, I think consumers will pick an electric vehicle, because they're better,\" Barra predicted.",
      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do. We focus on that, and we look at how do we make each of our team members more efficient.\"",
      "She also noted there are some instances in which \"the precision of the job requires automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-inflation-december-2025-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:23:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

      "The top job for 2026: cardiac medical technician. The number of listings for the role on Indeed's website has surged 34% since 2022, while wages have grown by the same amount. Cardiac medical techs earn a median salary of nearly $134,000. Nurse practitioner ranks No. 3, with a median salary of $143,183.",

    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",

      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",

Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "summary": "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement\u200b that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
      "The responses to Mr. Trump's decision ranged from saying it risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" to predicting that \"China and Russia must be having a field day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. Several European countries have sent troops to Greenland in recent days, saying they are there for Arctic security training. Mr. Trump's announcement came Saturday as thousands of Greenlanders were wrapping up a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in the capital, Nuuk.",
      "The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff.",
      "The eight countries issued a joint statement Sunday: \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance,' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"",
      "The statement added: \"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.\"",
      "There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs, because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading. Norway and the U.K. are not part of the 27-member EU, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump's tariffs would impact the entire bloc. EU envoys scheduled emergency talks for Sunday evening to determine a potential response.",
      "It was unclear, too, how Mr. Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a Supreme Court challenge.",
      "European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from the divisions between the U.S. and Europe. She added in a post on social media: \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move also was panned domestically.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot and Democrat who represents Arizona, posted that Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs on U.S. allies would make Americans \"pay more to try to get territory we don't need.\"",
      "\"Troops from European countries are arriving in Greenland to defend the territory from us. Let that sink in,\" he wrote on X. \"The damage this President is doing to our reputation and our relationships is growing, making us less safe. If something doesn't change we will be on our own with adversaries and enemies in every direction.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found widespread opposition among Americans to buying Greenland or taking it by military force. Seventy percent said they would oppose using federal funds to buy the territory, and 86% said they would oppose seizing it militarily.",
      "The tariffs announcement even drew blowback from Mr. Trump's populist allies in Europe.",
      "Italy's right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, considered one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on the continent, said Sunday she had spoken to him about the tariffs, which she described as \"a mistake.\"",
      "The deployment to Greenland of small numbers of troops by some European countries was misunderstood by Washington, Meloni told reporters during a two-day visit to South Korea. She said the deployment was not a move against the U.S. but aimed to provide security against \"other actors\" that she didn't name.",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in France and also a European Parliament lawmaker, posted that the EU should suspend last year's tariff deal with the U.S., describing Mr. Trump's threats as \"commercial blackmail.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also achieved the rare feat of uniting Britain's main political parties \u2014 including the hard-right Reform UK party \u2014 all of whom criticized the tariff threat.",
      "\"We don't always agree with the U.S. government and in this case we certainly don't. These tariffs will hurt us,\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a longtime champion and ally of Mr. Trump, wrote on social media. He stopped short of criticizing Mr. Trump's designs on Greenland.",
      "Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who leads the center-left Labour Party, said the tariffs announcement was \"completely wrong\" and his government would \"be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/america-at-250-and-a-reckoning-for-president-trump/",
    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:17:33 -0500",
    "summary": "In this landmark year for American democracy, historian Lindsay Chervinsky, Washington Post columnist George F. Will, and Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama talk about what the second year of Trump's presidency may mean for America's future.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump took office a year ago, the news has never let up. Just consider recent weeks: An attack in Venezuela; talk of acquiring Greenland (via what Mr. Trump described as \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\"); a criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair; and the fatal shooting of an American woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent.",
      "Now, as we enter the second year of the second Trump presidency, we also enter the 250th year of our republic. Time to take a deep breath \u2013 and take stock.",
      "Historian Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, says that right now, America is at a turning point. \"Most republics in history don't last 300 years, and it's because it's a really hard thing to do,\" she said. \"It's a nation that is based on an idea rather than a shared ethnic or religious background. And that means it's going to be messy.\"",
      "\"I alone can fix this\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put himself at the center not only of the American presidency, but the American system. One of his most famous quotes is \"I alone can fix this.\"",
      "\"I think the American system was never designed to be based on one person; that's really what the Revolution is all about,\" Chervinsky said. \"The best administrations that we have seen \u2013 I would put Washington at the top of that list, Lincoln, FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 they understood that they were better if they had Congress on their side, if they were working together to pass legislation, to make decisions that would stand the test of time, because they had the buy-in of the American people through their representatives.\"",
      "To date, President Trump has had almost total \"buy-in\" from the Republican-controlled Congress. It passed his signature legislation last year, what he called his \"big beautiful bill\" of spending and tax cuts.",
      "Chervinsky said, \"From the very beginning, Congress was always envisioned as the vital force of the government. It was the body that was going to put forth legislation. It was going to pass a budget. It established the rules for any sort of military force. It could declare war. It was supposed to be the most powerful branch, which is why it's first.\"",
      "The bounds of executive power",
      "Recently, Mr. Trump told reporters that his \"morality\" is \"the only thing that can stop\" him. When asked whether the president is testing the bounds of executive power, Washington Post columnist George Will replied, \"President Trump is denying that there are bounds of executive power.\"",
      "Will, a conservative who has chronicled Washington dynamics for more than 50 years, has had sharp criticism for President Trump and his use of power. Indeed, many Republicans on Capitol Hill privately agree with Will, but are publicly silent.",
      "Asked why, Will replied, \"Fear. It's really simple. Of 435 members of the House, there are perhaps 35 competitive districts, which means that an incumbent Republican only has to fear a primary from the right \u2013 being primaried. And they all feel they are one hostile Trump tweet away from a primary challenge.\"",
      "But would incumbents even want to stay in the job these days? Will noted, \"We have this really unfortunate dynamic that the very sort of people you want to stay are leaving. You want them to stay 'cause they take the job seriously. They're leaving because they say it's not a serious job anymore.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the Trump administration's use of federal forces in American cities and towns, Will said, \"Other presidencies haven't done this. Surely when Detroit had horrible riots in the '60s, and Watts and all the rest, troops were sent in, National Guard. But no president has done what this one has done. These young men and women come in [as] ICE dressed for combat on Iwo Jima.",
      "\"But the masks? Why are they wearing masks?\" Will asked. \"What are they hiding, and from whom, and why?",
      "When Mr. Trump first came to power in 2017, he seemed almost unfamiliar with where the levers of power were in the federal government. This time around is different. \"I think he has adjusted to the presidency,\" Will said. \"And I also think (unlike in 2017), in the first year of the second Trump term, we realized that he had people around him now who understood the nuts and bolts of government. [And] they have pushed things.\"",
      "\"President to the world, not just to Americans\"",
      "That push is evident on the foreign front, where the president has pursued an aggressive policy that has been cheered by domestic allies \u2013 and rattled allies abroad.",
      "\"He came in this time really keen to be president to the world, not just to Americans,\" said Vivian Salama, who covers foreign affairs for The Atlantic. \"He's coming to it with what his supporters call 'masculine' foreign policy.\"",
      "Seven years ago, Salama and her colleagues at the Wall Street Journal revealed President Trump had designs on Greenland. \"I thought it was a joke,\" she said. \"It certainly is not a joke now. And in fact, we know that there are serious policy discussions happening at the State Department and the White House and elsewhere in the government, where the wheels are very much in motion to try to figure out how best to make this happen.\"",
      "Even with Venezuela, China, Taiwan, Iran, the Middle East and other global tensions, Salama says the most vexing issue for President Trump in the world is the Ukraine-Russia war, still hovering over him. \"Remember, on the campaign trail, he promised to solve it before he even took office. He said it would take 24 hours,\" she said. \"It is a little harder than that. Governing is hard. Governing is actually hard. And then diplomacy is even harder, and especially when you're dealing with someone like Vladimir Putin, who was a shrewd KGB agent and knows how to manipulate his adversaries. And this is what President Trump is realizing. He says, This is a hard one and I thought it was gonna be easy, but it's hard.\"",
      "Another hard one: this year's midterm elections. The economy will be issue #1, and who controls Congress could determine the future of the Trump presidency \u2013 and the president remains at the center of it all, leaving us all wondering what comes next.",
      "Chervinsky says we are living through a historic time: \"I personally like writing about historic times; I think I'd be okay living in a boring moment for a little while!\" she said. \"Those living through the Revolution or the Civil War understood that they were living through a historic moment. I think that is true of this moment. We can feel that history is being made. We're just not exactly sure what future generations are gonna say about us.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump pledged to back GOP Rep. Julia Letlow if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed a potential primary challenger to Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy late Saturday, encouraging Rep. Julia Letlow to run for the seat held by the Republican who has occasionally broken with his party.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Letlow in a post on Truth Social while pledging to back the Republican congresswoman if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
      "\"Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!\" the president said.",
      "Cassidy, who's seeking a third term in the Senate, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. A medical doctor, Cassidy has also been at odds with the administration in recent months over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership.",
      "Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's nomination out of committee in February, cementing his confirmation to the post. Despite expressing misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades, Cassidy ultimately supported him, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. But since then, Cassidy has broken with the HHS secretary on multiple occasions, including calling for the postponement of key vaccine advisory panel meetings and slamming a change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
      "Still, the Louisiana Republican has repeatedly emphasized his cooperation with the administration in recent months. Late last year, Cassidy, who leads the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, worked to spearhead a new approach to address health care costs that Mr. Trump had touted. Amid a push to extend health insurance tax credits by Democrats, Cassidy introduced a measure to put funds into health savings accounts as the president pushed for sending money directly to Americans rather than insurance companies.",
      "Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump's post on social media Saturday.",
      "\"I'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana,\" Cassidy said in a post on X. \"If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\"",
      "Letlow, who became the first Republican woman elected to represent Louisiana in Congress in 2021, has not previously announced a Senate bid. She came to the House after winning a special election for Louisiana's 5th Congressional District following the death of her husband, who died in 2020 from complications related to COVID-19 before he could be sworn into office.",
      "Letlow thanked the president for his support in a post on X Saturday.",
      "\"I'm honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,\" Letlow said. \"This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.\"",

    "summary": "Looking overseas, there is wide opposition to the idea of taking Greenland by force.",
    "story": [
      "More Americans now describe ICE's operations as too tough when stopping and detaining people, and there's a growing view that President Trump's deportation program is targeting more people than just dangerous criminals.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.",
      "In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program \u2014 which has roughly divided the nation for months \u2014 has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.",
      "And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.",
      "There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.",
      "So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.",
      "Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.",
      "More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.",
      "Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.",
      "Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.",
      "Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.",
      "Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran",
      "Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.",
      "Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.",
      "Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.",
      "The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.",
      "Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.",
      "What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?",
      "Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.",
      "Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.",

      "That sentiment has been a regular theme throughout his second term. It matters to Americans because a large majority continues to say their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation.",
      "People say prices, specifically, are the top way they judge the overall economy, so other measures \u2014 like the stock market or even jobs \u2014 don't move the needle for them quite the same way that prices do.",
      "By contrast, Americans today believe the administration puts too much focus on events overseas.",
      "Still, despite the net negativity, the views of Mr. Trump and Republicans' approaches to the economy and immigration issues nonetheless outpace perceptions of the Democrats' approach.",
      "Looking back over that first year, few Americans feel that the president's policies have made them better off. In fact, more say worse than either the same or better.",
      "(A year ago, the expectation among many was that Mr. Trump's policies would improve their finances.)",
      "As he talks about the economy of late, the president's ratings on his handling of it have come off their lows this term.",
      "As Mr. Trump has publicly disagreed with some of the Fed's decisions, a large majority continue to think it's best for the economy if the Fed makes decisions independently from what the president wants.",
      "Issues related to finances, like the economy, jobs, and inflation, remain high priorities in the minds of Americans. And with recent attention on the events in Minneapolis, as well as those overseas, the issues of immigration and international events have seen a bump up in importance.",
      "How do you feel about Trump's presidency?",
      "Americans are generally mixed on how much the president has done in this first year of his second term; most in his party feel he's done more than expected. Americans overall say he's either done more or about what they'd thought.",
      "Those who feel he's done less than expected overall are especially likely to say he's not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Americans pick a wide range of sentiments to describe how Mr. Trump's first term has made them feel. \"Uneasy\" and \"frustrated\" emerge as top picks; Republicans are more apt to pick \"confident\" and \"satisfied,\" and \"safe\" but not at the rate that Democrats pick words like \"uneasy.\"",
      "Overall Trump approval",
      "The president's overall approval hasn't changed substantially in recent months and has been steady in recent weeks.",
      "The past year, Mr. Trump has seen routinely solid approval from his Republican base (especially from MAGA, and especially on immigration) as he does today. But over the course of the year he's also seen declines among independents and younger people, among others, which has coincided with the declines in views on his handling of the economy and inflation that took place over the year.",
      "Comparison to Democrats",
      "Despite the majority disapproval for Trump on the issues, Trump and the Republicans' approaches to both the economy and immigration still outpace views of the Democrats' approaches. Plenty say neither or aren't sure as the nation heads into another election year.",

      "He says that the employee was released sometime after they were detained and is safe.",
      "\"This incident is unacceptable.

He says that he \"urged them to be more respectful to the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.\"",
      "In response to a request for comment on the incident, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security shared a statement that said: \"Neither ICE nor CBP have any record of any employee of the LA County's DA's office being detained.

    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 20:49:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Mr. Trump previously threatened to impose tariffs against countries that do not support his plans to acquire the territory.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on countries that have sent military forces into Greenland amid his push to annex the Arctic island.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that the tariffs will be levied against Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland and take effect on Feb. 1, 2026. All eight countries are members of NATO.",
      "The tariffs will be increased to 25% on June 1, Mr. Trump wrote, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"",
      "There was no forewarning from official channels to U.S. allies and NATO partners before Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday, two European diplomats told CBS News. Officials in those allied nations feel alienated, frustrated and see this as a potential breaking point in the U.S.-Europe relationship, multiple diplomats said. Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel on Tuesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he likely will run into the European leaders he just threatened with tariffs.",
      "CBS News senior foreign correspondent\u00a0Liz Palmer described the Danish soldiers as a \"token force\" and said the military presence \"is a signal to Washington that if Trump is worried about Arctic security, his NATO allies are willing to do their part in helping to look after it.\" On Truth Social, Mr. Trump accused the countries of having \"journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.\"",
      "\"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.\"",
      "In a statement Saturday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democratic lawmakers in the upper chamber would introduce legislation to block \"these tariffs before they do further damage to the American economy and our allies in Europe.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump's foolhardy tariffs have already driven up prices and damaged our economy and now he is only making things worse,\" Schumer wrote. \"It is incredible that he wants to double down on the stupidity by imposing tariffs on our closest allies for his quixotic quest to takeover Greenland.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, also criticized the tariffs early Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies,\" he\u00a0wrote on X. \"It's great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see NATO divided. The fact that a small handful of \"advisors\" are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid. It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the NATO alliance over the years.\"",
      "Thousands of Greenlanders, including Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, took part in a protest march Saturday against Mr. Trump from Greenland's capital city of Nuuk to the U.S. Consulate, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"I thought this day couldn't get any worse but it just did,\" 21-year-old Malik Dollerup-Scheibel said after the AP told him about Mr. Trump's tariff announcement. \"It just shows he has no remorse for any kind of human being now.\"",
      "Thousands of people also protested in front of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.",
      "European leaders react to Trump tariff threats",
      "In a statement posted to X on Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the country is \"committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere,\" and it is on that basis that France \"decided to take part in the exercise organized by Denmark in Greenland.\"",
      "\"Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context,\" Macron said. \"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat to impose tariffs on European nations \"come as a surprise,\" Denmark's foreign minister said Saturday in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,\" said Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs Lars Lokke Rasmussen. \"We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter.\"",
      "Other European leaders are also having discussions to form a joint response, according to Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. In a statement to AFP on Saturday, Kristersson said, \"We won't let ourselves be intimidated.\"",
      "\"I will always defend my country and our allied neighbours,\" he added, stressing that this was \"a European question.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that NATO allies should be working together, adding he will be talking with the Trump administration directly about the tariff threats.",
      "\"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" Starmer said in a statement.",
      "Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 member countries will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday. The meeting was called by Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, according to Reuters.",
      "EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, president of the European Council, said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump's tariffs would \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "\"Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,\" they said, adding that \"the EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.\"",
      "\"Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S.,\" they said.",
      "In a post to LinkedIn, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business and mineral resources, praised the response of European leaders.",
      "\"I am amazed to witness the first responses from the targeted countries,\" Nathanielsen wrote. \"I am thankful and hopeful for diplomacy and allieship to prevail.\"",
      "Trump's interest in Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes the U.S. needs to acquire the island for\u00a0national security reasons. He has said the island is vital for the\u00a0Golden Dome missile defense system\u00a0he intends to build, and has expressed concern about\u00a0Russia or China\u00a0acquiring Greenland. The sparsely populated island is the location of the northernmost U.S. military base and has reserves of\u00a0oil, natural gas and minerals. Its northern position also means it is near\u00a0valuable shipping routes\u00a0that may become even more useful as warm temperatures melt sea ice in the area.",
      "Leaders of the semi-autonomous Danish territory have repeatedly stated that the island is not for sale, and residents of Greenland have protested a potential acquisition.",
      "Mr. Trump's post came as a bipartisan U.S. Congressional delegation attempted to reassure Greenlandic and Danish leaders during a visit to the Arctic island. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said that Greenland needs to be viewed as a U.S. ally, \"not as an asset.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said he was considering tariffs on countries that \"did not go along with\" his plans to acquire Greenland, though he did not offer specifics.",
      "Greenlandic and Danish leaders met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday to discuss long-term security in Greenland. Denmark and the U.S. still have \"fundamental\" disagreements about Greenland's future, Denmark's foreign minister said that afternoon, but a working group to discuss cooperation was established. A Danish official told CBS that Denmark offered more security access and greater defense investment. The official added that Denmark has set two things as a red line: territorial integrity and self-determination for Greenlanders.",
      "The White House has not ruled out the use of military force to take the island, despite warnings from Denmark that doing so would be seen as a threat to the NATO alliance.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed President Trump for the deaths and injuries of protestors during recent demonstrations that shook the Middle Eastern country.",
      "\"We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,\" he said, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. Khamenei was speaking to a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday.",
      "Khamenei also described the protests as an \"American conspiracy\" and accused the United States of trying to \"put Iran back under military, political and economic domination.\" He also called Mr. Trump a \"criminal,\" Reuters said.",
      "\"The latest anti-Iran \u200dsedition was different in that the U.S. president \u2060personally became involved,\" Khamenei said, according to Reuters.",
      "The protests began as demonstrations against economic hardship and snowballed quickly into nationwide protests against the Islamic Republic's leadership.",
      "The demonstrations raged for more than two weeks before authorities began a brutal crackdown. Iran's Internet was shut down late last week, and information from within the country is still hard to come by. Two sources inside the Islamic Republic, including one inside Iran who was able to call out of the country on Tuesday, told CBS News that at least 12,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 people are feared to have been killed. Thousands of others were arrested and are now\u00a0facing possible death sentences\u00a0for taking part in the demonstrations.",
      "Senior foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab said on \"CBS Saturday Morning\" that sources inside Iran have described a nation \"gripped with fear and in deep mourning.\"",
      "\"We've had accounts of mass funerals and bodies buried in unmarked graves,\" Tyab said. The worst of the violence reportedly came during what's being called \"The Night of Blood\" last Thursday, he said.",
      "Sources say there is now relative calm during the day, Tyab said, though chants of \"death to the dictator\" rise from rooftops at night.",
      "Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that there would be \"very strong actions\" against the Iranian regime if it hanged accused protestors. He said in the Oval Office on Wednesday that \"we have been told that the killing in Iran is stopping, it has stopped, it's stopping.\"",
      "\"They've said the killing has stopped and the executions won't take place,\" he said, citing \"very important sources on the other side\" but not giving any specifications. \"There were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won't take place. And we're going to find out.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump even took the unusual step of thanking the Iranian government for not following through on executions of what he said were meant to be hundreds of political prisoners.",
      "\"Iran canceled the hanging of over 800 people,\" he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, adding that he \"greatly respected\" the move.",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly expressed his support for the protestors and told Iranians that \"help is on its way.\" The Trump administration says the president has a\u00a0range of options\u00a0at his disposal, from conventional military strikes to cyber warfare.",

    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger has been sworn into office as Virginia's first female governor. Spanberger was sworn in at noon Saturday amid a cold drizzle outside the state Capitol after centuries of men holding the state's top office.",
      "\"The history and the gravity of this moment are not lost on me \u2014 I maintain an abiding sense of gratitude to those who worked generation after generation to ensure women could be among those casting ballots, but who could only dream of a day like today,\" Spanberger said in her inauguration speech.",
      "\"I stand before those who made it possible for a woman to also participate in that peaceful transfer of power and take that oath\u2026\"\u00a0 she added.",
      "Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin, also a Republican. During the election, Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration. She frequently capitalized on frustrations over federal layoffs in a state with nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs\u00a0to cinch the role.",
      "Her victory marks a new chapter as Democrats pull the levers of power in Virginia while Republican President Trump sits in the White House next door.",
      "Two other Democrats were also sworn in. Ghazala F. Hashmi, the first Muslim woman to serve in statewide office in the U.S., is the new lieutenant governor. Jay Jones\u00a0is the first Black person elected attorney general in Virginia, winning the race despite a text message scandal.",
      "She will be referred to with traditional formality: \"Madam Governor\" or, as some officials phrase it, \"her excellency.\"",
      "Spanberger's inauguration marks a new chapter in the state, with Democrats pulling the levers of power in state government while Republicans run neighboring Washington. The state Democrats picked up 13 seats in the House of Delegates a year after the party's stunning losses nationwide in the\u00a02024 presidential election.",
      "The governor ran on a vow to protect Virginia's economy from the aggressive tactics of Mr. Trump's administration. On the trail, she spoke of the White House's gutting the civil service, rising costs of goods and changes impacting the state's already fragile health care system.",
      "She addressed these issues during her inauguration speech, saying she knows many \"are worried about the recklessness coming out of Washington,\" which is cutting healthcare access, imperiling rural hospitals, and driving up costs. She added she know many are worried about \"Washington policies that are closing off markets, hurting innovation and private industry, and attacking those who have devoted their lives to public service.\"",
      "Democrats in the statehouse have vowed to work with Spanberger to push through their bullish agenda, which includes redrawing the state's Congressional district map ahead of the midterm elections this year.",

He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals.",
      "The Trump administration has not ruled out taking the island by military force.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would be imposing 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European countries because of their opposition to his administration's plans for Greenland.",

      "European leaders have insisted it is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.",
      "\"There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,\" Coons said. \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\"",

      "Mr. Trump supports the group's efforts to govern Gaza after the two-year war between Israel and Hamas. Israeli troops withdrew from parts of Gaza after the ceasefire took effect on Oct. 10, while thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to what is left of their homes.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff were key negotiators in helping Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas reach a ceasefire deal, the premise of which was based on a 20-point blueprint from the White House. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in October, Kushner said the success or failure of the peace plan would depend on whether Israel and the international partners involved can create \"a viable alternative\" to Hamas' violent tactics.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-interest-rates-federal-reserve-hurdles-jerome-powell-subpoena/",
    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "As the president prepares to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he's made no secret of his goal for lower interest rates \u2014 but there are a few political roadblocks in the way.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump prepares to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming months, he hasn't been shy about his goal for the powerful economic posting: lower interest rates.",
      "\"I want somebody that when the market is doing great, interest rates can go down because our country becomes stronger,\" the president said during a speech in Detroit on Tuesday. He's long pushed for lower rates, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow.",
      "He has also made no secret of his frustration with outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has supported cutting interest rates at a fairly slow clip, wary of causing inflation to resurge. For months, Mr. Trump has called Powell \u2014 whom the president appointed Fed chief during his first term \u2014 a \"moron,\" a \"stubborn mule,\" a \"real stiff\" and \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "And then, in a surprising Sunday night video message, Powell announced the Fed had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department \"threatening a criminal indictment\" over Powell's testimony to Congress about a pricey renovation to the Fed's headquarters. He accused the administration of using the renovation cost overruns and his testimony as \"pretexts.\" He also argued the independence of the Fed, which operates separately from the executive branch and isn't funded by tax dollars, is at risk.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said, asserting that this threat \"is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"",
      "The White House says Mr. Trump didn't direct the Justice Department to issue subpoenas, and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro has insisted the subpoenas were \"not a threat,\" but were instead issued because the Fed wasn't answering questions. In an interview with CBS News, Mr. Trump brushed off allegations of political retribution, saying: \"I can't help what it looks like.\"",
      "But the subpoenas have outraged some Republican lawmakers, jeopardizing Mr. Trump's plan to immediately nominate a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May.",
      "That congressional pushback is just the latest roadblock in Mr. Trump's quest to get the Fed to cut rates. There's also the looming possibility that Powell could remain on the Federal Reserve's board even after his term as chair ends. And ultimately, the decisions on interest rates are made by a committee that's largely out of the president's reach.",
      "\"As we learned this week, [Mr. Trump] may not have as much freedom to pick a Fed chair as he thought,\" David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, told CBS News.",
      "New Fed chair will need to get through a skeptical Senate",
      "Mr. Trump has identified two leading candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed board member Kevin Warsh.",
      "\"The two Kevins are very good,\" the president told Reuters.",
      "But the next chair will need to be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 and there are signs the Justice Department's investigation into Powell could complicate things, as several GOP lawmakers have raised concerns that the Fed's delicate independence may be at risk.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina reacted furiously to the Powell probe, writing on X that Trump advisers were \"actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" Tillis wrote just hours after Powell publicly announced the subpoenas.",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, and if he were to vote with the panel's Democrats to oppose Mr. Trump's nominee, the committee would deadlock 12-12.",
      "Any nominee who makes it to the full Senate could face skepticism from several other Senate Republicans. In the current Senate, Mr. Trump can afford to lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats vote against his Federal Reserve pick.",
      "Among the GOP skeptics: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Powell's video revealing the subpoenas raised \"a lot of disturbing questions,\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she sees the investigation as a bid to \"intimidate, threaten and coerce.\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he thinks it's unlikely that Powell did anything wrong and warned the conflict between Mr. Trump and the Fed chief could be economically damaging.",
      "\"If you wanted to design a system to cause interest rates to go up and not down, you would have the Federal Reserve of the United States and the executive branch of the United States get into a pissing contest. We don't need it,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has the ability to bypass a deadlocked Banking Committee and enable a nominee to reach the floor for a vote, acknowledged to reporters Monday that the investigation could make it challenging to confirm new nominees to the Fed.",
      "\"If the Justice Department is pursuing something, I hope they have a smoking gun or something, because I don't think you trifle with the Federal Reserve,\" the South Dakota Republican said Tuesday.",
      "What if Powell doesn't step down?",
      "Another possible wrinkle: Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, but his term as a rank-and-file member of the Fed's Board of Governors doesn't end for another two years.",
      "All seven members of the board serve 14-year terms, but the board's chair serves a separate four-year term. In recent history, most Fed chairs have resigned from the board altogether when their time as boss runs out, but there's nothing requiring them to do so.",
      "Powell has served on the Fed since 2012. He was nominated to a 14-year term by former President Barack Obama two years later, was elevated to chair during Mr. Trump's first term and was nominated to a second term as chair by former President Joe Biden. The 72-year-old Powell hasn't said whether he plans to leave the Fed when his term as chair expires.",
      "Murkowski told reporters Monday that if the goal of the scrutiny on Powell is to get him to speed up his departure from the Fed, it could have the opposite effect.",
      "\"When you get pressured, when you get threatened in this way, most of us would say, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" she said.",
      "Wessel told CBS News he doesn't think Powell is likely to stay on the Fed board, but said: \"I do think there's a possibility, and I think the possibility went up over the last week.\"",
      "If Powell decides to stick around until his term ends in January 2028, it could cause a few problems for Mr. Trump's push for a Fed that aligns with his views on interest rates.",
      "Because the new Fed chair must be selected from among the existing seven Fed governors, there needs to be a vacancy on the board in order for Mr. Trump to appoint a new person as chair. If Powell doesn't create a vacancy by resigning, the president would likely need to nominate his chair to the board seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran.",
      "A Trump economic adviser, Miran was confirmed to a short-term posting on the Fed board last year after a Biden-nominated governor resigned before her term expired. His term as a Fed governor ends on Jan. 31, but it's not clear if Mr. Trump had planned to nominate him to a fresh 14-year term after that. (If a successor to Miran isn't nominated when his current term ends, he can remain in place until the Senate confirms a replacement, under federal law.)",
      "If Mr. Trump replaces Miran with his handpicked Fed chair and Powell remains on the board, only three of the Fed's seven governors would be Trump nominees: the chair, plus two officials who were initially appointed during Mr. Trump's first term, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller.",
      "That could increase to four Trump nominees out of seven after Powell's term ends in 2028. But the three remaining governors \u2014 all Biden nominees \u2014 have terms that end in 2032 or later, keeping them on the Fed until well after Mr. Trump leaves office unless they choose to resign.",
      "Chair doesn't set interest rates on his own",
      "The composition of the Fed's rank-and-file board members matters for Mr. Trump because, when it comes to interest rate-setting decisions, the chair is technically one vote out of a dozen.",
      "Interest rate policy is overseen by a 12-member panel called the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of all seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating cast of four of the other 11 regional Fed bank chiefs.",
      "Mr. Trump has very little control over the regional Fed presidents who sit on the committee. They're hired for five-year terms by each regional bank's board of directors, and while the Fed's Board of Governors needs to approve their appointments, the board voted unanimously to extend most sitting regional bank presidents' terms until 2031 last month. Wessel said the board can fire presidents.",
      "So, depending on whether Powell stays on the Fed, either three or four of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members are set to be Trump nominees.",
      "When the committee meets eight times a year to set interest rate targets, the Fed chair traditionally plays a key role in helping the panel form consensus, but the members vote on their own. It's not uncommon for members to dissent from the committee's decisions, and there's no guarantee that their views will align with Mr. Trump's.",
      "\"If they don't respect the chairman, and the chairman bows to pressure from Trump and wants to do a deep interest rate cut that the other members of the committee think is nuts, they will vote against it,\" Wessel said.",
      "Dissents have been commonplace in recent months. When the committee voted to leave rates flat in July, Bowman and Waller pushed for a rate cut \u2014 but their stance hinged on a belief that the economy is softening, not that it's extremely strong as Mr. Trump argues. And in December, when the committee voted to cut rates by 0.25 points, Miran dissented and called for a larger 0.5-point cut, while two regional presidents favored no cut at all.",
      "And if Powell stays on as a Fed governor, Wessell said he could have \"considerable influence,\" too.",
      "Can Trump fire Fed officials?",
      "Mr. Trump is fighting in court for an extra board seat \u2014 and for more power to shape the board.",
      "Over the summer, the president attempted to fire board member Lisa Cook, accusing the Biden nominee of making false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "The dramatic move posed the first-ever test of a president's power to fire Fed members. Under federal law, the president can only remove board members \"for cause,\" a term that isn't defined.",
      "Cook has sued over the firing, arguing that an \"unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications\" doesn't meet the law's requirement for cause. But the Trump administration has argued the president acted within his power.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in Cook's case on Jan. 21. The courts have let Cook remain in her job \u2014 and vote on interest rate policy \u2014 while the lawsuit plays out, but the federal government is asking the Supreme Court to allow her to be removed for the time being.",
      "It's not clear how the high court might rule. In a separate case that's also set to be decided this term, the Supreme Court appears to be leaning toward giving the president more power to fire members of independent government agencies without cause. But the court has hinted in the past that it views the Federal Reserve as special.",
      "In an order last year that let Mr. Trump fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court explicitly said that the Fed wouldn't be impacted, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "The case could have broad implications for whether the Fed remains independent.",
      "Mr. Trump has long argued that he should have some input in the Fed's interest rate-setting decisions, saying last month that \"my voice should be heard\" because of his business background.",
      "But many experts say it's essential that the Fed operate independently of political influence so that it can weigh the economy's long-term best interest, rather than accommodating politicians' short-term desire for low rates and a hot economy.",
      "\"I think the expectations are [that] the Supreme Court doesn't want to turn the Fed inside out and they're going to let [Cook] stay,\" Wessel said. \"If they didn't let her stay, that would basically be the end of the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",

      "The Trump administration is delaying its plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments, backing off a measure that threatened to deliver a financial blow to millions of Americans.",
      "The Education Department announced Friday that involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold as the agency finalizes new repayment plans. The shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause.",
      "Nicholas Kent, the department's higher education chief, said the agency is \"committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options.\"",
      "\"The Department determined that involuntary collection efforts such as Administrative Wage Garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program will function more efficiently and fairly after the Trump Administration implements significant improvements to our broken student loan system,\" Kent said in a statement.",
      "Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans, meaning they are at least 270 days behind on payments. The penalties were put on hold during a pandemic-era pause on student loan payments that the Trump administration lifted.",
      "Last spring, Trump officials said they would resume targeting tax refunds for borrowers in default. In December, officials said they would restart wage garnishment in January, with initial notices being sent to 1,000 borrowers the week of Jan. 7.",

      "The department did not set a new date for involuntary collections. It said the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.",
      "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon indicated earlier this week that the department was planning to pause wage garnishment efforts in remarks to local reporters in Rhode Island.",
      "More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to department data. Millions more have fallen behind on loan payments and are at risk of going into default this year. Nearly 10% of borrowers were delinquent by more than 90 days in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to April 2023, and for a one-year grace period after that, borrowers who missed payments could avoid default. The Education Department announced in May that it would resume collections activity.",
      "McMahon said earlier this week that \"we had an incredible falloff in people repaying their loans\" during the pandemic-era pause.",
      "Friday's announcement was welcomed by student loan advocates who urged the department not to resume wage garnishment.",
      "\"The administration's plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the nonprofit Protect Borrowers, told the Associated Press.",
      "Congress last year ordered the department to overhaul repayment plans that critics said had become too confusing. New borrowers will have two options: a standard plan and a plan that lowers payments based on the borrower's income.",
      "Last month the department scrapped the SAVE Plan, which was created under former President Joe Biden and offered lower payments and a quicker path to student loan forgiveness. The plan had been blocked by a federal judge after Missouri and other states challenged it in court.",

    "story": [
      "A Minnesota federal judge put limits Friday on the tactics that federal law enforcement are permitted to use in their handling of the ongoing protests in Minneapolis over the Trump administration's surge of immigration resources to the city.",
      "In an 83-page order, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez blocked federal agents who are deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration's immigration operations from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on, or arresting, peaceful protesters.",
      "The order also bars federal law enforcement from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is \"no reasonable articulable suspicion\" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.",
      "Menendez, nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden in 2021, called some of the allegations against agents \"disturbing.\" She cited descriptions provided to the court by protesters that law enforcement had threatened to break drivers' windows, waited for protesters outside their homes, followed protesters to their homes or told the protesters they knew where they lived.",
      "\"There may be ample suspicion to stop cars, and even arrest drivers engaged in dangerous conduct while following immigration enforcement officers, but that does not justify stops of cars not breaking the law,\" Menendez wrote, adding she is \"mindful\" that the ongoing protest activity in the state is \"somewhat unique.\"",
      "\"There is little discussion in the caselaw about situations like the ones playing out all over the Twin Cities, in which small groups of protesters are mobile and gather wherever immigration officers are attempting to make arrests or otherwise enforce immigration law,\" Menendez wrote.",
      "Menendez's order will remain in effect until the recent mass surge of federal law enforcement to Minneapolis concludes.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement responding to the ruling that the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.\" She said agents have faced assaults, vandalism and other threats, but have \"followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary.\"",
      "\"We remind the public that rioting is dangerous\u2014obstructing law enforcement is a federal crime and assaulting law enforcement is a felony,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The ruling follows a weekslong uptick in immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the area to seek out those suspected of being in the U.S. illegally and to investigate allegations of fraud in Minnesota.",
      "The operations have drawn tense protests that were amplified after Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week. In some cases, protesters and agents have clashed, with agents being reported using pepper spray.",
      "A group of Minnesota protesters sued the Department of Homeland Security last month, alleging federal agents had \"violently subdued\" demonstrations against the agency's immigration enforcement actions. The plaintiffs accused the government of engaging in a \"campaign of constitutional violations\" by infringing on protesters' First Amendment right to free speech and Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.",
      "Menendez found Friday that several of the protesters were likely to succeed in showing that their First and Fourth Amendment rights were violated after federal law enforcement personnel arrested them or sprayed chemical irritants at them.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government earlier this month\u00a0denied any constitutional violations, arguing that federal agents have needed to use pepper spray and arrests to quell \"violent, obstructive, dangerous, and often criminal behavior\" that has impeded immigration operations. They accused several of the plaintiffs of obstructing, assaulting or attempting to assault federal officers, or following ICE vehicles.",
      "The Trump administration has also accused local officials who have strongly criticized the immigration operations of stoking chaos. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are both under federal investigation for an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents, CBS News reported earlier Friday.",
      "Both officials have denounced the probe, with Walz accusing the administration of \"threatening political opponents\" and Frey calling it an \"obvious attempt to intimidate me.\"",

Medical staff immediately attempted lifesaving measures and then transported him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead about one hour later.",
      "ICE said it first encountered Sanchez on Jan. 7 after he was arrested for driving without a license, DHS said. Two days later, on Jan. 9, ICE filed a notice requiring Sanchez to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "DHS said Sanchez entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 22, 2023, at or near Nogales, Arizona. Border Patrol agents arrested him that same day and issued him a notice to appear. He was later released without bond.",
      "After his Jan. 7 arrest, ICE transferred Sanchez to the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center as he awaited removal proceedings. Medical staff conducted an intake evaluation and reported no signs of distress at the time.",
      "On Thursday, Mexico's consulate in Atlanta said it was \"closely monitoring\" the death of a Mexican citizen Wednesday at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility and was maintaining \"permanent communication\" with the ICE field office in Atlanta.",

      "Pennsylvania's two sitting senators \u2014 Republican Dave McCormick and Democrat John Fetterman \u2014 told CBS News they do not support a U.S. military takeover of Greenland, but are open to more U.S. control over the Arctic island coveted by President Trump.",
      "Fetterman told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Friday that \"it's not an absurd idea\" for the U.S. to buy Greenland from Denmark, given its strategic importance. He argued the idea is \"not a brand-new conversation,\" pointing to a secret Cold War-era proposal by former President Harry Truman to purchase the territory for $100 million.",
      "\"But obviously we're not showing up with the military [to] take over. It's the size, in terms of the population, of Harrisburg. I mean, you're not going to invade,\" added Fetterman, who spoke to Dokoupil in a joint interview with McCormick at U.S. Steel's Mon Valley Works-Irvin Plant in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin.",
      "McCormick told CBS News he believes there's an \"open door\" for \"diplomatic negotiations, for commercial negotiations\" with Denmark on Greenland.",
      "\"I agree with the senator that \u2026 we shouldn't use military force, but I think we need to have a strategic foothold, and I think there's a path to it, and I think the Trump administration will get there,\" McCormick said.",
      "In the past, McCormick has floated both a \"voluntary purchase\" of Greenland and deeper U.S. ties to the island as potential options, while Fetterman\u00a0has said: \"Ideally, we purchase it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has floated a U.S. takeover of Greenland for months, pointing to the territory's strategically valuable location. His administration has not ruled out taking the island by military force, and on Friday, Mr. Trump threatened to hike tariffs on any countries that don't \"go along with\" his push to annex Greenland.",

      "President Trump has pardoned Puerto Rico's former governor, Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, who pleaded guilty last year in a federal public corruption case.",
      "Her two co-defendants, the billionaire Venezuelan-Italian banker and Britannia Financial Group founder Julio Martin Herrera Velutini and Mark Rossini, were also pardoned Thursday for their crimes in the bribery scheme, according to Justice Department records.",
      "The plan to issue the pardons was first reported by CBS News.",
      "Herrera Velutini's daughter, Isabel Herrera, donated\u00a0$2.5 million in December 2024\u00a0and\u00a0$1 million\u00a0last July to the pro-Trump political action committee MAGA Inc., according to public records. A White House official told CBS News that the donations had nothing to do with the pardon.",
      "\"Mr. Herrera Velutini is profoundly grateful to President Donald J. Trump for bestowing the grace of his benevolent pardon and looks forward to moving on with his life and dedicating his time to his family and career,\" his attorney Chris Kise told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which last year was largely dismantled, charged the three in 2022 with conspiracy, federal programs bribery, and honest services wire fraud in connection with V\u00e1zquez's 2020 campaign.",
      "All three defendants pleaded guilty to lesser corruption charges in August, after the Justice Department abruptly cut a deal with the defendants as the case was nearing trial.",
      "Among the defense attorneys who helped broker the deal with Mr. Trump's Justice Department was Chris Kise, who previously defended the president over criminal charges that he retained classified information after departing the White House in early 2021.",
      "Last year, as the trial approached, Kise met with senior department officials and sought to convince them to drop or reduce the charges, sources previously told CBS News.",
      "It was one of corruption cases in which defense lawyers in the last year have sought to have dismissed, claiming without evidence they were examples of weaponization by the Biden administration, the sources previously said.",
      "Trump officials have said they believed the case was politically motivated, noting the investigation into V\u00e1zquez started in 2020, days after she had endorsed Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Ms. V\u00e1zquez's pardon materials state that there was never any element of a quid pro quo deal and that her prosecution was politically motivated,\" a White House official told CBS News, speaking anonymously because the president hasn't yet formally announced the pardons.",
      "In July, the federal judge presiding over the case expressed dismay after the Justice Department said it wanted to dismiss the most serious offenses and allow the defendants to plead to lesser misdemeanor charges of violating the Federal Electoral Campaign Act.",
      "\"Strikingly, the penalty for violating Section 30121 of the FECA is a mere slap on the wrist when compared to the sentencing exposure the defendants faced if convicted of the conduct charged in the Indictment,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Silvia Carre\u00f1o-Coll for the District of Puerto Rico.",
      "\"But alas, the Government's decision to shift gears at the eleventh hour is allowed because ultimately the Government decides how it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion,\" she added.",
      "The Public Integrity Section, which prosecuted the case along with the local U.S. Attorney's office, was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal and was tasked with handling some of the most politically sensitive prosecutions.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department ordered it to stop consulting with U.S. attorneys, and it had all but two of its prosecutors transferred into other jobs throughout the department.",
      "As the section has unraveled, Mr. Trump has undone much of its work over the past year, pardoning a slew of defendants the section had successfully prosecuted or were in the process of prosecuting.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats asked Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rand Paul to hold hearings on the federal law enforcement deployment in states.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Homeland Security Committee Democrats are urging the panel's chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, to convene oversight hearings and call Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify, after the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.",
      "Good's fatal shooting on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer has sparked days of protests and heated clashes with federal officers, and it's prompted renewed scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.",
      "In a letter first obtained by CBS News, Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, called on Paul, a Kentucky senator, to use the panel's authority to hold hearings and potentially issue subpoenas to senior administration officials.",
      "In addition to Noem and Homan, the lawmakers said ICE acting director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino should be called before the committee.",
      "The senators said the deployment of federal agents has occurred \"without appropriate coordination with state and local law enforcement.\" They also accused federal officers of engaging in \"numerous operations involving excessive uses of force,\" including in the case of Good's killing.",
      "Good sustained at least three gunshot wounds, and possibly a fourth, according to a Minneapolis Fire Department incident report obtained by CBS News Minnesota. The newly released details followed a week of protests in Minnesota that prompted President Trump to threaten invoking the Insurrection Act. The rarely used law would allow him to deploy the U.S. military to the state or federalize the National Guard.",
      "Democrats say Good's killing is part of a broader pattern. They catalogued incidents beyond Minnesota, alleging federal agents appear to have used excessive force in firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters, detaining U.S. citizens during immigration raids \u2014 despite proof of citizenship \u2014 and deploying tear gas and pepper balls against journalists covering demonstrations.",
      "The lawmakers also expressed concern about agents conducting operations while masked and their use of unmarked vehicles, both practices they say have fueled fear and confusion in communities.",
      "The senators accuse DHS leadership of failing to fairly and transparently investigate such incidents. They faulted Noem for claiming publicly that \"no American citizens have been arrested or detained,\" despite lawsuits, rulings and reporting that indicate otherwise, and for stating in the immediate aftermath of Good's killing that she had committed an act of domestic terrorism.",
      "In response to the Democrats' letter, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \"DHS is a law enforcement agency \u2014 enforcing the rule of law passed by Congress. If members don't like the law, it is quite literally their job to change it.\"",
      "She added, \"As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, politicians are more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually removing criminals from our streets.\"",
      "Noem last testified before Congress on Dec. 11, during a contentious House hearing on immigration enforcement that ended abruptly when she left early, a move Democrats criticized as evading oversight. A subsequent Democratic effort to subpoena her testimony was blocked by Republicans.",
      "The push for Senate hearings comes as Congress negotiates funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers passed a three-bill package this week funding several federal agencies, but left DHS unresolved after Democrats said they would not support a funding bill without new accountability measures for ICE.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats in both chambers are demanding changes to ICE's conduct as part of the appropriations process, ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline.",
      "The oversight demand also comes as ICE operations expand nationwide. CBS News reported Friday that the agency's detainee population has reached a record high of 73,000.",
      "With Republicans in control of the Senate, Democrats cannot compel hearings or subpoenas on their own. But the letter places pressure on the GOP chairman at a moment when scrutiny of ICE operations, DHS leadership and federal enforcement tactics is intensifying.",
      "A spokesperson for Paul said the chairman's office is reviewing the letter.",

    "summary": "Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to placate President Trump and build a strong relationship between the U.S. and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing \"compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.",
      "The comments come after President Trump threatened action against Mexican drug cartels by U.S. forces last week. Mr. Trump told Fox News last week that the United States had \"knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water\" and that the U.S. was \"going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.\" The Trump administration has also begun to\u00a0add militarized zones to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a \"cool head,\" has sought to placate Mr. Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. A dramatic\u00a0United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed\u00a0former president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in early January set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Mr. Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.",
      "On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed \"more must be done to confront shared threats.\"",
      "Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. Mexican authorities seized over 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine from clandestine laboratories in the country earlier this week.",
      "She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\"There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,\" she said.",
      "She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.",
      "\"The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump also spoke by phone on Monday. Sheinbaum said it was a \"very good conversation.\"",
      "\"We told him, so far it's going very well, it's not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico's sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The Pentagon says it's changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it no longer includes \"woke distractions.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \"reporting for our warfighters\" and no longer includes \"woke distractions.\"",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership.",
      "It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \"editorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\" and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \"governed by the principles of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Mr. Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes - to effectively shut it down - before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that, \"We are bringing Stars & Stripes into the 21st century. We will modernize its operations, refocus its content away from woke distractions that syphon morale, and adapt it to serve a new generation of service members.",
      "He said the Pentagon \"is returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters\" and will \"refocus its content away from woke distractions.\"",
      "\"Stars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\" Parnell wrote. \"It will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\"",
      "He said the department is committed to ensuring the outlet's legacy of reporting news that's important to service members.",
      "Stars and Stripes' publisher, Max Lederer, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment. But Jacqueline Smith, the outlet's ombudsman, called Parnell's statement a surprise. She said Stars and Stripes reports on matters important to service members and their families - not just weapons systems or war strategy - and she's detected nothing \"woke\" about its reporting.",
      "\"I think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\" Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith serves in a role created by Congress three decades ago to ensure that independence, and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump has also sought to shut down government-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that report independent news about the world in nations overseas.",
      "Also this week, the administration raided the home of a Washington Post journalist as part of an investigation into a contractor accused of stealing government secrets, a move many journalists interpreted as a form of intimidation.",
      "The Post reported that applicants to Stars and Stripes were being asked how they would advance Mr. Trump's executive orders and policy priorities in the role. They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",
      "Smith said it was the government's Office of Personnel Management - not the newspaper - that was responsible for the question on job applications and said it was consistent with what was being asked of applicants for other government jobs.",

    "summary": "Demand has risen for the EB-1A visa, creating a cottage industry of services for vanity awards, ghostwritten research papers and \"profile building\" services. USCIS is investigating potential fraud.",
    "story": [
      "As the backlog has grown for many employment-based U.S. visas, applications have skyrocketed for the so-called \"Einstein visa\" reserved for people who can show extraordinary ability in their fields.",
      "But as interest has spiked in the high-achiever visa, called the EB-1A, so has a market for credential-boosting services that in some cases may constitute fraud, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "Some visa hopefuls, especially in science and technology fields, have turned to a marketplace of services to pad their resumes with false or low-quality records of achievement. Research brokers or consultants ghostwrite research papers, boost article citations, or confer vanity awards to customers willing to pay up to hundreds or thousands of dollars.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes the applications, is aware that a growing number of EB-1A applicants have been applying with purchased or fraudulent credentials, two former USCIS officials familiar with the agency's fraud investigations told CBS News.",
      "\"If you have money, then you have a way to buy your evidence and fabricate those things,\" said the official, who left the agency last year and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations at USCIS.",
      "Those who are caught misrepresenting themselves or using fraudulent credentials on a visa application may simply have their application denied, but could also be prevented from successfully reapplying for a visa by being deemed inadmissible to the U.S. USCIS could also revoke an existing visa from someone if they find they lied on their application.",
      "\"USCIS is committed to rooting out fraud by thoroughly screening and vetting all aliens seeking immigration benefits,\" agency spokesman Matthew Tragesser wrote in a statement to CBS News. \"Anyone submitting fake evidence or misrepresenting themselves will be found out and face the consequences.\"",
      "But those who sell the credentials, middlemen who often operate anonymously on social media or through companies marketed as consulting groups, profit regardless.",
      "Academic research brokers",
      "The number of EB-1A petitions has tripled over the past four years, according to quarterly data from USCIS. Nearly 7,500 applied from April to June 2025, the most recent available data shows, up from about 2,500 in the last three months of 2021.",
      "Meanwhile, the approval rate for EB-1A petitions has been dropping since 2021, with about 67% approved from April to June 2025. Data from immigration analytics platform Lawfully indicates it dropped to closer to 50% in recent months.",
      "Applicants must demonstrate they meet at least three of 10 criteria to be considered for an EB-1A visa, such as winning awards, authoring scholarly articles, or being a member of a professional association.",
      "CBS News identified dozens of posts and advertisements on Telegram, Facebook and in WhatsApp groups marketing scholarly papers that customers can pay to have their names on. Several posts specifically targeted visa applicants.",
      "WhatsApp and Facebook owner Meta confirmed some of the posts violated their policies around fake documents, frauds and scams, in which they ban content that \"enables users to get visa approvals without fulfilling normal requirements.\" Meta removed the ads that CBS News sent to a company spokesperson as examples.",
      "Three individuals who posted advertisements told CBS News that clients didn't need to contribute to the papers to be listed as authors.",
      "One individual running a visa \"profile enhancement\" Facebook page told software engineer Abhishek Bakare in May that for $500, he could list him as the fourth author on a computer science research paper, according to a recording of a phone call between the two that Bakare shared with CBS News.",
      "Bakare, who developed an artificial intelligence tool to spot low-quality research, had feigned interest in making a purchase to gather information on the fraud, he told CBS News.",
      "\"Already I was working on this [paper] from the past four to five months,\" the seller told Bakare on the phone. \"I'm adding you literally at the very last stage.\"",
      "He later added that at the time, he had 55 clients, all of them Indian nationals and most aiming for EB-1A or similar employment-based visas.",
      "\"There are people, those who have paid, they have basically purchased a paper,\" the seller admitted, \"which is not sort of ethical for EB-1.\"",
      "A paper with the same title as the one he offered Bakare was accepted by an international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a widely-respected organization within the electrical engineering industry.",
      "When CBS News contacted the seller, he denied that he offered to sell the authorship position to Bakare, and instead claimed the $500 was for a conference fee. If Bakare had moved forward with working with him, he said, he would have had to create the conference presentation to get his name on the paper.",
      "\"My process is the same for everyone: without actively working on a paper, it isn't practically possible for me to add anyone,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message. \"I have not done this in the past, I am not doing it now, and I will not do so in the future.\"",
      "Some papers are published not just to confer authorship to a paying customer, but simply to cite an existing paper to make it appear more credible. One of the research brokers CBS News spoke with, based in Nigeria, charges $500 for a citation.",
      "\"I will boost citations by writing 100% human written articles and publishing them to a journal but I will include your article references in the reference section,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message\u00a0 to CBS News.",
      "He told CBS News he has a team of 10 people who work on the writing and publication process. All of his clients are trying to get U.S. visas, he said.",
      "Low-quality scientific research produced for resume padding isn't an activity exclusive to visa applicants, according to researchers at Northwestern University and The University of Sydney. They found in a recent study that low-quality or plagiarized papers are increasingly published not only in predatory, pay-to-publish platforms, but reputable journals as well.",
      "They discovered that a small group of bad actors were hired as editors at reputable journals,\u00a0 allowing them to \"accept for publication pretty much anything,\" said Luis Amaral, one of the study's authors.",
      "\"It's almost like a spy movie, right? You send a spy to infiltrate a place and that spy inside is actually betraying the organization,\" he said.",
      "In some cases, individuals will submit a paper to a journal, and once they secure acceptance, request to add authors during the editing process, said Reese Richardson, another author on the study. This allows research brokers to sell authorship slots in papers that are all but guaranteed to be published.",
      "\"Profile building\" services",
      "The EB-1A criteria extend beyond papers and citations. That has led to the rise of \"profile building\" services that promise to help customers enhance their resumes, CBS News found.",
      "Arizona-based Next League Program's website says that clients will become eligible candidates for EB-1A visas in \"a matter of a few months,\" and previously promised that participants will become authors of at least one book, over 100 articles and become a founder of an institution with a patent to their name. Its owner, Ranjeet Mudholkar, says that 56 individuals who completed the Next League Program received EB-1A visas.",
      "Two former participants shared receipts showing they paid about $10,000 to enroll. Company lawyers said in court documents that it earned $1 million in revenue in 2024.",
      "\"In my mind it was like, I will get a helping hand to accomplish those things with little time from my end,\" said one former participant, referring to the website's promises. He added that he believed the program's director had connections with journals and award companies that would help him achieve the credentials.",
      "He and another participant who spoke with CBS News requested their names be withheld because they signed a non-disparagement agreement.",
      "In return for their payments, they received dozens of hours of pre-recorded videos with advice on how to hone their areas of expertise and prepare their applications. Neither said they thought the guidance was adequate to build the resume the program's website advertised, and neither received the one-on-one coaching they said they were promised, which required making their way through the prerecorded content first.",
      "They soon came to believe that some Next League participants were buying their credentials, they told CBS News.",
      "At least seven successful EB-1A applicants who completed the program received the same vanity award, called the Globee Business Award, a review by CBS News found. Immigration attorneys told CBS News that although the award's website claims it has a \"rigorous and comprehensive judging process,\" it is easily obtained by those who pay a fee.",
      "At least two of those individuals had published scholarly articles in an India-based journal whose website promises to publish peer-reviewed papers within four hours of submission after publication fees were received. One of them told CBS News their review took a few days, and that she chose it because it had lower submission fees.",
      "Richardson, the academic fraud researcher, reviewed the journal and described it as \"predatory,\" identifying several alleged red flags to CBS News. A genuine peer review process takes months, often longer than a year, and there is no guarantee after an article is submitted to a legitimate journal that it will be sent out for peer review or that it will be published, he said.",
      "The journal's editors told CBS News they do not guarantee publication and accept roughly half of all submissions.",
      "When asked about purchased credentials, Mudholkar wrote in a statement to CBS News that the company \"does not sell, require, or mandate any specific awards, journals, or publications, nor does it submit evidence without legal review and advisement,\" and that \"participants retain agency over where they publish.\"",
      "A few of the Next League Program participants also set up a professional organization, the American Association of Information Technology Professionals. Mudholkar agreed to be the chairman, so they would have a U.S. citizen on paper as its leader, he told CBS News. Being a member of a professional organization or society meets one of the EB-1A criteria.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Mudholkar disputed the idea that Next League Program's sole purpose is to help visa hopefuls meet these criteria.",
      "\"You really need to be an expert in your field,\" he said. \"We are looking for people who have changed lives.\"",
      "He described the program as a \"transformation coaching program\" that follows a process he patented, and said that he encourages applicants to view the visa as a \"milestone\" in becoming the best version of themselves.",
      "Mudholkar also repeatedly emphasized that the company's status as an alternative business structure in Arizona lends it a layer of regulatory overview other companies don't have. The structure allows non-lawyers to run a company that provides legal services, and requires getting a license from the state Supreme Court.",
      "In interviews, two former participants Mudholkar referred to CBS News praised the program and credited it with helping them get an EB-1A visa. But multiple others wrote on social media or in complaints to the Arizona attorney general's office that they felt they were scammed.",
      "\"As with any selective, high-intensity program, experiences vary. Public praise and criticism both exist,\" Mudholkar wrote to CBS News.",
      "Profile building services can blur the line of what's considered fraudulent.",
      "\"Having an attorney or career coach help you apply to legitimate opportunities that can raise an applicants' profile is not wrong,\" immigration attorney Loren Locke said. \"That line between what's appropriate like profile building, what's fair-game versus what's shady, it can be difficult to spot.\"",
      "A yearslong backlog meets a USCIS crackdown",
      "Federal law sets annual limits for each visa category. In FY 2025, the cap was 140,000 employment-based visas, including EB-1A, with no more than 7% going to nationals of one single country, regardless of its population.",
      "That can create huge backlogs, particularly for applicants from India and China, where demand for U.S. employment-based visas is high. Many of the services and advertisements CBS News reviewed appeared to target Indian nationals, who have to wait years to receive certain visas.",
      "The EB-1 visa, of which EB-1A is a subcategory, is less backlogged than the EB-2 visa, which is reserved for those with \"exceptional ability,\" but does not require the same level of acclaim as the EB-1A.",
      "That's helped make EB-1A \u2014 and the marketplace of services around it \u2014 more popular.",
      "\"They've been put in a situation just that's super untenable, which increases desperation, which increases risk taking.\" Locke said.",
      "The vast majority of EB-1A applicants are not fraudulent, said Melissa Warburton, an immigration attorney who left USCIS last year. Investigations into EB-1A fraud, which Warburton said predate the current administration, are coinciding with a broader crackdown on fraud in visa applications.",
      "\"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns,\" said USCIS director Joseph Edlow in an October interview with CBS News's Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "In its recent hiring push for immigration service officers, USCIS created the new title of \"homeland defenders.\" Its informational webpage includes a video of Edlow saying the agency is \"declaring war on fraud.\"",
      "USCIS announced in early December it was launching a new vetting center focused on \"more thorough supplemental review of immigration applications and petitions.\"",
      "It is not clear how much of this effort will be directed toward EB-1A petitions, which make up less than 1% of the total applications USCIS processes each year.",
      "\"USCIS is strengthening the integrity of all immigrant worker programs with increased screening and vetting in support of President Trump's promise to protect American jobs and workers,\" Tragesser, the agency spokesperson, wrote to CBS News. \"Anti-fraud measures apply to EB-1A as they do to all immigration benefit categories.\"",
      "This month, the agency will propose a new regulation that will, among other changes, \"update provisions governing extraordinary ability,\" \"modernize outdated provisions\" and \"clarify evidentiary requirements\" for the visa.",
      "USCIS may now be going back and reevaluating some EB-1A applications it already approved to check for fraud, immigration attorneys and the former USCIS employees said. The agency can revoke a visa, and even initiate a denaturalization process, if it can prove willful misrepresentation or fraud.",
      "\"We don't know to what extent people have done this,\" said immigration attorney Evan Law, \"but if they did commit fraud, it will come back to them eventually, in my view.\"",

      "New dinosaur fossils were discovered at the Dinosaur National Monument, leading to the first excavation there in more than 100 years, officials revealed Friday.",
      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",
      "Research released last October suggests that dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago.",
      "In January 2025, a nearly\u00a070-million-year-old dinosaur fossil was discovered during a parking lot project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. It is the oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within Denver's city limits.",
      "\"This fossil comes from an era just before the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs, and it offers a rare window into the ecosystem that once existed right beneath modern-day Denver,\" the museum's Curator of Geology, James Hagadorn, said at the time.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:12:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Four Artemis II astronauts plan to fly around the moon and back next month, traveling farther from Earth than any humans before them.",
    "story": [
      "After months of meticulous preparation, NASA's 32-story-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, was hauled to its seaside launch pad Saturday in Florida, setting the stage for a long-awaited flight next month to send four astronauts on a trip around the moon.",
      "The 5.7-million-pound rocket, carried by an upgraded Apollo-era crawler-transporter tipping the scales at some six million pounds, began the trip to pad 39B just after 7 a.m. local time, creeping out of NASA's cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at a top speed of just under 1 mile per hour.",
      "Hundreds of space center workers, family members and guests gathered near the VAB and along the crawlerway to take in the sight, posing for selfies and enjoying a chilly Saturday morning as the towering moon rocket slowly rolled past.",
      "New NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and the Artemis II astronauts \u2014 Cmdr. Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen \u2014 were also on hand to witness the milestone.",
      "\"Wow. LETS GO!!!\" Wiseman posted on the social media platform X with a photo of the SLS rocket moving out of the VAB. In another post, he called the SLS and its Orion crew capsule \"engineering art.\"",
      "Wow. LETS GO!!! pic.twitter.com/xozFfnJI8c",
      "Generating some 8.8 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, the SLS is the most powerful rocket ever operated by NASA, including the agency's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. It has a little more than half the thrust of SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but after a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022 \u2014 Artemis I \u2014 NASA deemed it safe enough to put astronauts aboard.",
      "The SpaceX rocket is still in the test phase, and it's not known when it might make its first flight with people on board.",
      "The Artemis II crew plans to blast off in early February to test drive their Orion crew capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space on a flight around the moon that will carry them farther from Earth than any astronauts have ever ventured. In the process, they will get a chance to observe the far side of the moon in some detail.",
      "\"I think one of the most magical things for me in this experience is when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent (moon) in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,\" Wiseman told reporters during the SLS rollout. \"It was a waning crescent here, so it's a waxing gibbous on the far side.\"",
      "He added: \"And you just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look, and seeing Earth rise, those sorts of things, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective is what I think when I look out (at the moon) right now.\"",
      "The trip to launch pad 39B took about eight hours, kicking off a busy few weeks of tightly scripted tests and checkouts before a critical fueling test around Feb. 2 when nearly 800,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen will be pumped aboard for a \"wet\" dress rehearsal countdown.",
      "\"One of the first things that happens after we get to the pad, we get  connected ... all the validations, getting tied back to the firing  room, getting ready to power up the individual elements,\" said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"We will get into our crew module  work (and) we're going to power everything up.\"",
      "Blackwell-Thompson added: \"We have  incrementally tested all of this offline or in the integrated  environment of the VAB and now it's just getting out to the pad and  testing those pad interfaces. ... Wet dress is the big test at the pad.  That's the one to keep an eye on, I guess, that's the driver to launch.\"",
      "The maiden flight of the SLS rocket in 2022 was delayed multiple times by propellant loading problems and persistent hydrogen leaks. For the rocket's second flight, NASA and its contractor team have implemented multiple upgrades and procedural changes to minimize or eliminate any such problems the second time around.",
      "\"Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,\" said Blackwell-Thompson. \"And the things that we learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.\"",
      "Because of the relative positions of the Earth and moon, along with the trajectory NASA plans to use for Artemis II, the agency only has five launch opportunities in February: Feb. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because rollout came a few days later than planned, pushing the fueling test into early February, it would appear only the final three opportunities are still available.",
      "But a leak-free fueling test, in the absence of any other major issues, will clear the way for a launch attempt on one or two of those days. If not, the next set of launch windows opens in March.",
      "A wild card in the mission planning is the launch of a fresh crew to the International Space Station to replace four crew members who returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue affecting one of the astronauts. That launch originally was scheduled for Feb. 15, but NASA managers are looking into moving it up by several days to minimize the gap between crews.",
      "NASA flight controllers want to avoid flying two piloted spacecraft at the same time. If the space station crew replacement flight stays on track, or if problems are found during the SLS fueling test, agency managers might be forced to delay the Artemis II launch to the next set of opportunities in March.",
      "But Isaacman is keeping NASA's options open.",
      "\"We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,\" he said. \"But look, that's our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared. We'll take it.\"",

    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

      "Descending under four large parachutes, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov landed in the Pacific off San Diego at 3:41 a.m. EST, closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",
      "\"All four crew members will be transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation, taking advantage of medical resources on Earth to provide the best care possible,\" NASA said in a blog post.",
      "\"Following a planned overnight hospital stay, the crew will return to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will reunite with their families and undergo standard post-flight reconditioning and evaluations.\"",
      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven: Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flyer gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years.",

      "\"So one part of us are getting ready to leave this beautiful space station, and another part is getting ready to take over full command and get (it) ready for another Dragon crew to come,\" Fincke said.",
      "\"This is the International Space Station. We've had continuous human habitation for 25 years. It's a wonder of engineering, a wonder of science and a wonder of diplomacy. We're from all over the planet, and we're working together. It's a great symbol of what human beings can do.\"",
      "Fincke thanked each crewmate for their performance during the shortened mission, telling Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, \"you are a rock star, superstar, awesome star.\"",
      "\"It's been a pleasure serving with you, watching you see Earth for the first time, riding on the rocket, and now it's coming to an end where we get to go home,\" he said. \"It's bittersweet.\"",
      "All four Crew 11 fliers looked healthy and in good spirits on a  space-to-ground television broadcast of the change of command ceremony with no indication of which astronaut may have experienced the undisclosed medical issue that triggered Crew 11's early departure.",
      "Fincke then presented Kud-Sverchkov with a symbolic key to the space station.",
      "\"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we're going to do our job on board ISS, performing scientific tasks, maintenance tasks, whatever happens. It's a big honor to be a commander of space station,\" Kud-Sverchkov said. \"Thank you, Mike. And I want to (issue) the first command: let's make a group hug!\"",
      "And with that, all seven station crew members floated together to hug each other as suggested by Fincke before he handed over the key to the space station.",
      "Fincke, Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov were told to cut their mission short last week after an unidentified crew member reported a medical issue.",
      "NASA said the early return was not an emergency. But by bringing the crew down right away, agency officials said, flight surgeons will be better able to diagnose the issue with facilities and expertise not available aboard the station.",
      "Cardman, Fincke, Yui and Platonov plan to undock from the station around 5 p.m. Eastern Time Wednesday, about a month earlier than originally planned.",

      "Kud-Sverchkov and his two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates \u2014 Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams \u2014 will have the station to themselves until mid February when Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev arrive.",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI announced Friday that it will begin testing ads on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, opening the door to another potential revenue stream for the AI company in addition to its subscription-based models.",
      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",
      "Only adults who use the free version of ChatGPT, or ChatGPT Go, a new low-cost subscription plan OpenAI announced Friday, will be shown ads. Higher-tier subscriptions, including Pro, which now costs $200 a month, will not include ads, OpenAI said.",
      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",
      "The AI company said the ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT provides and that it will not share conversations users have with the chatbot \u2014 or their data \u2014 with advertisers.",
      "The OpenAI spokesperson did not disclose the companies it intends to advertise on ChatGPT but said the company will \"have more to share about our early partners soon.\"",
      "OpenAI framed the introduction of the ads as a way to keep the free and low-cost versions of the chatbot accessible to more users.",
      "\"Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.",
      "The AI company, which launched ChatGPT in 2022, is valued at $500 billion, but hasn't turned a profit yet, CNBC reported in November. The additional cash flow generated from ads could help ChatGPT invest in its growth and fund ongoing expenses, Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told CBS News.",
      "Still, it remains to be seen what role ads will play in OpenAI's overall business strategy. During a podcast\u00a0interview\u00a0last year, CEO Sam Altman downplayed the importance ads would play in OpenAI's revenue stream. \"I expect it's something we'll try at some point,\" he said. \"I do not think it is our biggest revenue opportunity.\"",

      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",

      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",

      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "The Chinese mobile app \"Are You Dead?\" which sounds an alarm if a user doesn't check in every 48 hours, has announced it will drop its catchy name, after it drew international media attention.",
      "It rose to the top of paid app rankings on Apple's App Store in China, prompting widespread media coverage among Chinese and foreign press.",

      "\"After extensive consideration, the 'Sileme' app will officially adopt the global brand name 'Demumu' in its forthcoming new release,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday evening.",
      "It said the app has \"experienced explosive growth overseas\" since the publication of an article by British broadcaster BBC. Other foreign media outlets, including AFP, also covered the app's success.",
      "\"Demumu\" was already the name of the international version of the app, and \"Are You Dead?\" the Chinese version's.",
      "\"Moving forward, Demumu will remain steadfast in its founding mission of safeguarding safety, bringing China-originated protection solutions to the world and serving more solitary individuals globally,\" the company's statement added.",
      "Users expressed surprise online at the rebranding, although its blunt name had divided public opinion.",
      "\"Don't you think your virality is precisely due to your name? Without it, no one would have installed this app, except in cases of absolute emergency,\" said one Weibo user.",

      "Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok faces intense criticism \u2013 accused of allowing users on the Musk-owned social media platform X to generate fake, sexually explicit images of real women and children.",
      "Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Musk's children, is one of the alleged victims. She said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Tuesday that Grok allowed users to generate and publish sexual deepfake images of her to X without permission, including manipulating photos of her as a minor.",
      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",
      "The mother of two, who has a 1-year-old son with Musk, said she asked Grok to take the photos down.",
      "\"Grok said, 'I confirm that you don't consent. I will no longer produce these images.' And then it continued to produce more and more images, and more and more explicit images,\" she said.",
      "St. Clair said she filed a report directly with Musk's company xAI, which operates Grok. Some of the images were then removed.",
      "\"This can be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" St. Clair said.",
      "St. Clair said her issue is with the Chatbot, not Musk \u2013 who recently said he plans to file for sole custody of their child over allegations that St. Clair \"might\" transition their son. A source close to St. Clair said that is \"absurd and unequivocally false.\"",
      "\"If they want to say my bone to pick is \u2026 the chatbot undressing minors and myself and stripping me nude, yes. You're right. I have a bone to pick with that and I don't care who's doing it. So Elon's not special about me speaking out on this,\" St. Clair said.",
      "CBS News reached out to Musk and has not received a response yet. Earlier this month, xAI said it \"takes action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "\"Make it stop\"",
      "A recent study by AI Forensics, a nonprofit that investigates the algorithms of major platforms, found 53% of the Grok images they reviewed contained individuals in minimal attire, with 81% of them being women.",
      "St. Clair said she wants the U.S. government to solve the issue and \"make it stop.\"",
      "\"The need to regulate it,\" she said. \"AI should not be allowed to generate and undress children and women. That's what needs to happen.\"",
      "She believes the key is enforcing already existing laws, saying, \"who's ever responsible for enforcing them. Not me.\"",
      "St. Clair said her ability to earn money on X has been revoked since she has spoken out and when asked if she plans to take legal action, she said she's \"considering all options available.\"",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",

Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

      "Brumund is the president of the Highpointers Club, a group devoted to celebrating, and summiting, the highest peak in every state. \"It's partially about just coming together as a group that enjoys this kind of weird hobby that people haven't heard of,\" she said.",
      "On the surface, to those who do not prioritize elevation above all else, \"highpointing\" might sound a little bit pointless. After all, why would a person with enough skill to climb Wyoming's challenging Gannett Peak at nearly 14,000 feet, also care about visiting Britton Hill, a parking lot in the panhandle of Florida with an elevation of 345 feet?",
      "\"We have this, like, huge, unique, beautiful and diverse country, and a lot of people don't see a lot of it,\" said Lucy Westlake. \"And I just think highpointing is an amazing way to travel around the country and have, like, a purpose and a guideline on how to do that.\"",
      "In 2021, at 17 years old, Westlake became the youngest woman to ever visit every state highpoint. She now writes a column for the club's Apex to Zenith newsletter.",
      "For most members, getting to all 50 is a lifetime goal.",
      "While some of the highpoints are extremely physically challenging, others, like Mount Washington in New Hampshire, or High Point State Park in New Jersey, have drivable summits.",
      "And some can be logistically complex. The highest point in Illinois, Charles Mound, is on a private farm. But to accommodate the altitude-obsessed, the landowners allow access on just four weekends a year. \"A lot of hikers will say this is the hardest highpoint because you just got to time it,\" said Floridian Rick Wise, who has been hitting highpoints with his dog, Kika.",
      "Carol and Greg Weiland came to Charles Mound from Ohio, to continue their tradition of taking photos of their shoes on each survey marker.",
      "Two weeks before traveling to Illinois from Montana, Dee Winters summited Utah's 13,528-foot King's Peak. \"As a group, they encourage you to keep going and keep moving, and I think that's important,\" she said. \"As you age, you've got to keep moving, you have to. Otherwise, you'll sit and die. And I'm not up for that yet!\"",
      "Up on Charles Mound, surrounded by soybean fields, it's certainly scenic, but there is no superlative viewpoint, the kind that everyone says, \"You have to see.\" It's more of a geographical quirk that has brought people here. \"Yeah,\" said Ray O'Conor, who came from New York, \"but you know, the scenery, the farm fields, the dirt roads \u2013 there's a little bit of magic in almost every route that brings you to one of these places.\"",
      "It's what's brought siblings Lidy and Sjaak Van Schie from the Netherlands to the U.S. for dozens of highpointing expeditions. Asked what sort of reaction they get back home after visiting a spot no one has heard of, Sjaak said, \"Well, they don't understand. But we do, and that's most important!\"",
      "Lidy added, \"The nice thing about highpointing is that all those highpoints are places you would normally not go.\"",
      "Places like Bishop, California. As Shannon Brummund explains, coming to these Highpointers Club conventions, discussing all of these highs and lows, offers a chance to enjoy some middle ground. She said, \"I think being part of the club has helped me realize, like, if you sit down in a room with people and you're talking about something that you love, all the rest of the stuff matters less.\"",

    "summary": "To mark Martin Luther King Jr's birthday, \"Sunday Morning\" talks with some of those who were engaged from the very beginning of the civil rights movement, from sit-ins and marches to the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, Martin Luther King Day has been a federal holiday. But with his legacy and landmarks of the civil rights era no longer set in stone, we thought it might be a good time to look back at some events from the tumultuous decade between 1955 to 1965, and meet people who lived them.",
      "Tampa lunch counter sit-in",
      "Arthenia Joyner became a prominent lawyer, and a Florida state senator. But in February 1960, Joyner, then 17, was one of 20 Black high school students picked by the NAACP to take part in a sit-in at a Whites-only lunch counter. The old Woolworth's in downtown Tampa, Florida, is just a gutted shell now.",
      "Similar sit-ins by students took place across the South.",
      "Asked about being scared of taking part in the sit-in, Joyner replied, \"There are things that are bigger than fear. Older folks thought that you're taking a heck of a chance, you could get killed. Why are you doing this? Because we have a right to fight for respect and dignity, and we are gonna do it. It's time for a change.\"",
      "Joyner was a fifth grader in 1954, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously, in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools were unconstitutional. \"It said that I was equal,\" she said. \"I was entitled to have schools like the ones that the White kids went to. That inspired me.\"",
      "Montgomery bus boycott",
      "On Dec. 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White passenger on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama. What came next was the Montgomery bus boycott. Approximately 40,000 Black Montgomerians decided it was time. They walked, or took Black-owned taxis, or carpooled, rather than riding the bus, for over a year.",
      "Their spokesman: a young, unknown Martin Luther King, Jr., advocating non-violent, passive resistance.",
      "King and Parks' lawyer was Fred Gray. Just out of law school, 26 years old, he won the U.S. Supreme Court case that ended segregation on Alabama's buses, and by extension all public transportation.",
      "It was the first of four big civil rights cases \u2013 Browder v. Gayle (1956) on equal protection; NAACP v. Alabama (1958) on freedom of association; Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) on racial gerrymandering; and N.Y. Times v. Sullivan (1964) on free speech \u2013 that Gray would win before the Supreme Court by the age of 35. \"It was just taking one step at a time, and in my mind was to ultimately file lawsuits [that] would destroy everything segregated I could find,\" he said.",
      "Gray, now 95, winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was the titan of the civil rights movement the public didn't see at the head of a march. He was in court.",
      "Without those lawsuits, he was asked, would any of what we consider the civil rights movement achievements of those ten years have been possible? \"I don't think so,\" he replied.",
      "On television",
      "What else was pushing change? Television. On the evening news, images of non-violence being met with brutality. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964. Martin Luther King Jr won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the confrontations didn't stop.",
      "\"Bloody Sunday\" \u2013 Selma, Alabama, March 7, 1965, at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. This was not the peaceful march from Selma to Montgomery to promote voting rights that King and other movement leaders had spent months planning, staying with the Jackson family in Selma.",
      "\"The world had a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,\" said Jawana Jackson. \"I had an Uncle Martin that read me bedtime stories and offered me cookies.\"",
      "Jawana was four at the time. Her father, a dentist, and her mother, a teacher, saved everything, aware that they were preserving history. The house and its contents have been acquired by the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and moved there. It opens to the public in June.",
      "\"This house, for a brief period of time, belonged to the world,\" said Jawana. \"History is portable. The history, and the message of the Jackson house, can be told anywhere, but it must be told.\"",
      "Here, after Bloody Sunday, coordinating with President Lyndon Johnson and convincing the federal courts to let the march to Montgomery go ahead consumed these men. On March 15, as President Johnson spoke, 70 million Americans watched.",
      "\"Really it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice,\" said Johnson. \"And we shall overcome.\"",
      "On March 21, marchers set off from Selma protected \u2013 not beaten \u2013 by law enforcement. By the time they reached Montgomery four days later, there were 25,000 (Jawana and her mother among them).",
      "On the sixth of August 1965, LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act, considered by many the crowning achievement of the Civil Rights Era. Lately, attorney Fred Gray has watched as the Supreme Court chips away at it and other milestones he's devoted his life to making the law of the land.",
      "He says he believes the clock has turned back: \"But we can't give up. We can't look at saying it's turning back and then say, 'Well, I give up.' We were arrested. We were put in jail. We suffered all those things. But we didn't stop.\"",

    "summary": "Darci Bass was in a convenience store when in walked Matthew Edgar, out on bail while charged with the murder of Bass' daughter Livye Lewis.",
    "story": [
      "On Dec. 16, 2021, Darci Bass was standing in her local convenience store when the man who stood accused of the shooting death of her 19-year-old daughter Livye Lewis strolled in. \"When he came in the door ... I just went \u2014 started \u2014 started throwing whatever at him and went for him,\" Bass told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant in an interview for \"The Blackout Murder of Livye Lewis.\"",
      "An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, Jan. 17 at 9/8c on CBS and and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "It all began in the early morning hours of Halloween 2020, when Lewis was discovered on the side of a road in the tiny town of Hemphill, Texas. She was draped over the steering wheel of her car, dead from a rifle shot to the neck.",
      "Bass says she was not notified by police of her daughter's death. Instead, she heard from a friend that Lewis was in trouble and showed up at the crime scene demanding answers. \"I just needed to know is she alive or is she dead,\" Bass told Van Sant. Her anguished cries for answers were caught on police bodycam video. \"I wanna see my child,\" she shouted. \"Livye Lewis! Where is she?\"",
      "Sabine County Sheriff's Investigator J.P. MacDonough says that the minute he saw Lewis' body, he knew that Lewis' killer was no stranger to her. \"She was just sitting there with her legs crossed,\" he tells Van Sant. \"Well, it indicates to me she was not afraid ... She was actually, to some degree, comfortable with who she was speaking with.\"",
      "MacDonough says he didn't have to look very far for a suspect. Also discovered at the crime scene was Lewis' boyfriend, 23-year-old Matthew Edgar. \"He was found in the fetal position behind the vehicle that Lewis was found in,\" says MacDonough. Beside Edgar was his rifle.",
      "Edgar was rushed from the scene of the crime in an ambulance. Bloodied but not injured, he is seen on police bodycam footage lying in a hospital bed, being interviewed by MacDonough.",
      "\"When was the last time you saw Livye?\" MacDonough asks Edgar. \"Tonight,\" he answers, and then claims to have no memory of how he ended up at the crime scene. \"You don't know how you ended up on the ground behind the car ... With the dead girl in it,\" says MacDonough. \"No, sir,\" Edgar replies. \"I have no clue.\"",
      "But for Edgar's defense attorney Rob Hughes, it was not an open-and-shut case. \"We got all the DNA results back and ... there were some holes in the case,\" Hughes tells Van Sant. \"There were no fingerprints taken or DNA lifted off the gun.\"",
      "Shaun Dunn, who calls himself a close friend of Edgar's, tells \"48 Hours\" that he believes Edgar when he says he can't recall how he ended up at the crime scene. Dunn thinks that, like Lewis, Edgar was a victim and that someone else pulled the trigger. \"I believe it was someone that was ... close to Matthew,\" he says. \"Someone that was involved in events of that evening.\"",
      "But where Dunn sees a victim, MacDonough saw a suspect and arrested Edgar while he was lying in that hospital bed. Then, months later, Bass says that while she was praying for justice, Edgar was released. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the courts and with no grand juries being convened, Texas law required that a still-unindicted Edgar be allowed out on bail.",
      "It was months after Edgar's release when he walked into that convenience store in Bass' neighborhood. \"And I just remember saying, 'You killed my daughter ... you killed my daughter.'\" According to MacDonough, Bass chased Edgar into the parking lot, where she grabbed a chain in the bed of his truck and started slinging it across his windshield. Bass says she just wanted some answers: \"She loved you and she was good to you and your kids and to your family. What made you think that this was the answer to anything that was going on?\"",
      "Edgar called the sheriff's office and filed a complaint against Bass, who was then charged with assault caused by bodily injury, retaliation and criminal mischief. An arrest warrant was issued and Bass turned herself in. The charges were eventually dropped.",
      "On March 16, 2021, four-and-a-half months after his arrest, a grand jury heard the evidence against Edgar and indicted him for the murder of Lewis. But Edgar, who was still out on bail during his trial, was not done breaking the law. On the fourth day of trial, Edgar let the battery on his ankle monitor die and went on the run. His trial went on without him, and the jury found him guilty. But it took authorities 11 months to capture Edgar, so he could be sentenced to 99 years, with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:17:33 -0500",
    "summary": "In this landmark year for American democracy, historian Lindsay Chervinsky, Washington Post columnist George F. Will, and Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama talk about what the second year of Trump's presidency may mean for America's future.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump took office a year ago, the news has never let up. Just consider recent weeks: An attack in Venezuela; talk of acquiring Greenland (via what Mr. Trump described as \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\"); a criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair; and the fatal shooting of an American woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent.",
      "Now, as we enter the second year of the second Trump presidency, we also enter the 250th year of our republic. Time to take a deep breath \u2013 and take stock.",
      "Historian Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, says that right now, America is at a turning point. \"Most republics in history don't last 300 years, and it's because it's a really hard thing to do,\" she said. \"It's a nation that is based on an idea rather than a shared ethnic or religious background. And that means it's going to be messy.\"",
      "\"I alone can fix this\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put himself at the center not only of the American presidency, but the American system. One of his most famous quotes is \"I alone can fix this.\"",
      "\"I think the American system was never designed to be based on one person; that's really what the Revolution is all about,\" Chervinsky said. \"The best administrations that we have seen \u2013 I would put Washington at the top of that list, Lincoln, FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 they understood that they were better if they had Congress on their side, if they were working together to pass legislation, to make decisions that would stand the test of time, because they had the buy-in of the American people through their representatives.\"",
      "To date, President Trump has had almost total \"buy-in\" from the Republican-controlled Congress. It passed his signature legislation last year, what he called his \"big beautiful bill\" of spending and tax cuts.",
      "Chervinsky said, \"From the very beginning, Congress was always envisioned as the vital force of the government. It was the body that was going to put forth legislation. It was going to pass a budget. It established the rules for any sort of military force. It could declare war. It was supposed to be the most powerful branch, which is why it's first.\"",
      "The bounds of executive power",
      "Recently, Mr. Trump told reporters that his \"morality\" is \"the only thing that can stop\" him. When asked whether the president is testing the bounds of executive power, Washington Post columnist George Will replied, \"President Trump is denying that there are bounds of executive power.\"",
      "Will, a conservative who has chronicled Washington dynamics for more than 50 years, has had sharp criticism for President Trump and his use of power. Indeed, many Republicans on Capitol Hill privately agree with Will, but are publicly silent.",
      "Asked why, Will replied, \"Fear. It's really simple. Of 435 members of the House, there are perhaps 35 competitive districts, which means that an incumbent Republican only has to fear a primary from the right \u2013 being primaried. And they all feel they are one hostile Trump tweet away from a primary challenge.\"",
      "But would incumbents even want to stay in the job these days? Will noted, \"We have this really unfortunate dynamic that the very sort of people you want to stay are leaving. You want them to stay 'cause they take the job seriously. They're leaving because they say it's not a serious job anymore.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the Trump administration's use of federal forces in American cities and towns, Will said, \"Other presidencies haven't done this. Surely when Detroit had horrible riots in the '60s, and Watts and all the rest, troops were sent in, National Guard. But no president has done what this one has done. These young men and women come in [as] ICE dressed for combat on Iwo Jima.",
      "\"But the masks? Why are they wearing masks?\" Will asked. \"What are they hiding, and from whom, and why?",
      "When Mr. Trump first came to power in 2017, he seemed almost unfamiliar with where the levers of power were in the federal government. This time around is different. \"I think he has adjusted to the presidency,\" Will said. \"And I also think (unlike in 2017), in the first year of the second Trump term, we realized that he had people around him now who understood the nuts and bolts of government. [And] they have pushed things.\"",
      "\"President to the world, not just to Americans\"",
      "That push is evident on the foreign front, where the president has pursued an aggressive policy that has been cheered by domestic allies \u2013 and rattled allies abroad.",
      "\"He came in this time really keen to be president to the world, not just to Americans,\" said Vivian Salama, who covers foreign affairs for The Atlantic. \"He's coming to it with what his supporters call 'masculine' foreign policy.\"",
      "Seven years ago, Salama and her colleagues at the Wall Street Journal revealed President Trump had designs on Greenland. \"I thought it was a joke,\" she said. \"It certainly is not a joke now. And in fact, we know that there are serious policy discussions happening at the State Department and the White House and elsewhere in the government, where the wheels are very much in motion to try to figure out how best to make this happen.\"",
      "Even with Venezuela, China, Taiwan, Iran, the Middle East and other global tensions, Salama says the most vexing issue for President Trump in the world is the Ukraine-Russia war, still hovering over him. \"Remember, on the campaign trail, he promised to solve it before he even took office. He said it would take 24 hours,\" she said. \"It is a little harder than that. Governing is hard. Governing is actually hard. And then diplomacy is even harder, and especially when you're dealing with someone like Vladimir Putin, who was a shrewd KGB agent and knows how to manipulate his adversaries. And this is what President Trump is realizing. He says, This is a hard one and I thought it was gonna be easy, but it's hard.\"",
      "Another hard one: this year's midterm elections. The economy will be issue #1, and who controls Congress could determine the future of the Trump presidency \u2013 and the president remains at the center of it all, leaving us all wondering what comes next.",
      "Chervinsky says we are living through a historic time: \"I personally like writing about historic times; I think I'd be okay living in a boring moment for a little while!\" she said. \"Those living through the Revolution or the Civil War understood that they were living through a historic moment. I think that is true of this moment. We can feel that history is being made. We're just not exactly sure what future generations are gonna say about us.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump pledged to back GOP Rep. Julia Letlow if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed a potential primary challenger to Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy late Saturday, encouraging Rep. Julia Letlow to run for the seat held by the Republican who has occasionally broken with his party.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Letlow in a post on Truth Social while pledging to back the Republican congresswoman if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
      "\"Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!\" the president said.",
      "Cassidy, who's seeking a third term in the Senate, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. A medical doctor, Cassidy has also been at odds with the administration in recent months over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership.",
      "Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's nomination out of committee in February, cementing his confirmation to the post. Despite expressing misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades, Cassidy ultimately supported him, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. But since then, Cassidy has broken with the HHS secretary on multiple occasions, including calling for the postponement of key vaccine advisory panel meetings and slamming a change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
      "Still, the Louisiana Republican has repeatedly emphasized his cooperation with the administration in recent months. Late last year, Cassidy, who leads the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, worked to spearhead a new approach to address health care costs that Mr. Trump had touted. Amid a push to extend health insurance tax credits by Democrats, Cassidy introduced a measure to put funds into health savings accounts as the president pushed for sending money directly to Americans rather than insurance companies.",
      "Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump's post on social media Saturday.",
      "\"I'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana,\" Cassidy said in a post on X. \"If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\"",
      "Letlow, who became the first Republican woman elected to represent Louisiana in Congress in 2021, has not previously announced a Senate bid. She came to the House after winning a special election for Louisiana's 5th Congressional District following the death of her husband, who died in 2020 from complications related to COVID-19 before he could be sworn into office.",
      "Letlow thanked the president for his support in a post on X Saturday.",
      "\"I'm honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,\" Letlow said. \"This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:34:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Looking overseas, there is wide opposition to the idea of taking Greenland by force.",
    "story": [
      "More Americans now describe ICE's operations as too tough when stopping and detaining people, and there's a growing view that President Trump's deportation program is targeting more people than just dangerous criminals.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.",
      "In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program \u2014 which has roughly divided the nation for months \u2014 has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.",
      "And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.",
      "There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.",
      "So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.",
      "Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.",
      "More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.",
      "Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.",
      "Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.",
      "Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.",
      "Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran",
      "Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.",
      "Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.",
      "Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.",
      "The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.",
      "Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.",
      "What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?",
      "Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.",
      "Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,523 U.S. adults interviewed between January 14-16, 2026. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "Bruno Rocuba claimed he shot his wife Melissa Rocuba accidentally, but then he started getting rid of all her belongings. \"It's like he wanted her erased,\" said one of their daughters.",
    "story": [
      "On a summer's night in August 2013, 22-year-old Chelsea Cicio received an alarming call from her father, Bruno Rocuba. He said there had been a terrible accident and her mother, Melissa Rocuba, had been injured.",
      "Cicio, who lived next door to her parents in Simpson, Pennsylvania, was captured on a home security camera, frantically racing to see what had happened. She can be heard screaming, \"Mommy, Mommy\" as she enters the house and finds her mother has been shot in the head.",
      "\"Soon as I walked in, you could see right here \u2026 she was laying on the bed,\" Cicio told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Anne-Marie Green as they revisited the scene for \"Melissa Rocuba's Final Moments,\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "\"The blood was just all over the floor, the side of the bed,\" Cicio explained.",
      "Cicio said her father would later tell her that he had been sitting on the bed cleaning his gun, when her mother sat down and it accidentally went off. With one bullet, Bruno Rocuba had shot himself in the left hand and his wife in the head.",
      "Melissa Rocuba was airlifted to the hospital and placed on life support, as family raced to her bedside. Bruno Rocuba was taken to a different hospital, where he had surgery on his hand. \"Everyone felt horrible for him,\" said Cicio's older sister, Sabrina Rocuba. \"That's his wife of 25 years.\"",
      "The day after the shooting, Bruno Rocuba agreed to walk several Pennsylvania State troopers through his still bloody house and explain how the shooting happened. With a trooper videotaping him, Bruno Rocuba sat on a mattress stained with his wife's blood and used a toy gun to demonstrate how he says he accidentally shot her.",
      "Bruno Rocuba said his .40 caliber pistol was on the nightstand by their bed because there had been several robberies in the neighborhood. \"I reached over. I grabbed it,\" so he could put it away, Bruno Rocuba told investigators. \"My wife was sitting on the bed on that side. I was on this side,\" he continued. \"And I pulled the trigger by accident.\"",
      "Sabrina Rocuba says her father's story was very believable given the injury to his hand. \"We thought, like \u2026 well, who was gonna \u2013 who's gonna shoot themselves?\" \u00a0she said.",
      "Melissa Rocuba was in intensive care for three days when her family made the heart-wrenching decision to take her off life support. The next day, on Aug. 10, 2013, she was pronounced dead.",
      "The couple's daughters were devastated by the loss, but in the days that followed, they were so worried about their father that their focus was on comforting him. \"I kept wanting to make sure he was OK,\" said Cicio.",
      "Cicio said she was worried that her father might be arrested, so she recommended that he hire a top local attorney named Joe D'Andrea. But D'Andrea says he didn't have to do much to keep Bruno Rocuba out of jail. The Lackawanna County District Attorney's Office, he said, didn't have enough evidence to charge Bruno Rocuba with murder, so they didn't charge him at all.",
      "\"Not every shooting is a crime,\" said D'Andrea. \"He never wavered from his story \u2026 that it was an accident.\"",
      "But as time went by, Melissa Rocuba's daughters and her sister, Joanne Swinney, began to have second thoughts about the shooting and events that followed.",
      "For starters, said Swinney, Bruno Rocuba spent very little time by his wife's side as she lay dying. \"He would come there, maybe stay like an hour \u2026 and then leave,\" she said.",
      "While their mother was still on life support, Melissa Rocuba's daughters said their father asked them to clean his bloody house and get rid of the mattress on which their mother had been shot.",
      "\"He's like \u2026 I can't go home to that \u2026 I don't want to see all the blood,\" Cicio recalled. \"And here I am, 21, 22. \u2026 Now as an adult, I'm like, wow, I can't believe he asked us to do that.\"",
      "Melissa Rocuba's daughters said that even before their mother was buried, their father asked for help getting rid of her belongings.",
      "\"He wanted us to get rid of everything,\" Cicio told Green. \"It's like he wanted her erased.\"",
      "Sabrina Rocuba said her father even got rid of her mother's beloved 10-year-old Rottweiler, Zeus. \"My mom loved that dog. And my dad got rid of him right after my mom died,\" she says.",
      "Melissa Rocuba's sister said she was shocked when she saw that Bruno Rocuba had even removed all photographs of his wife. \"Bruno said he couldn't look at them \u2026 he was grieving, he couldn't look at them,\" said Swinney. She said Bruno Rocuba also got rid of her sister's entire wardrobe. \"We had to go down to the thrift store where they donated the clothes \u2026 and I had to get clothes for my sister to bury her in.\"",
      "But most alarming, said Cicio, was that within months of her mother's death, her father began dating a woman named Tonia Wilczewski. \"I remember looking out my window and she was cooking Christmas dinner in my mom's kitchen. I wasn't invited,\" she said.",
      "Swinney began to wonder if her sister's husband had been having an affair with Wilczewski prior to the shooting. Swinney said that not long after her sister's death, Melissa Rocuba's best friend got a call from Bruno Rocuba to ask her, \"How long do you think it is before, you know, you could kind of like go public with dating someone?\" And she said, \"Are you freaking kidding me?\"",
      "Wilczewski declined \"48 Hours'\" request for an interview but sent a text message that stated, \"There was never an affair.\"\u00a0 Bruno Rocuba never responded to requests for an interview.",
      "Despite their suspicions, Melissa Rocuba's daughters and sister said they didn't have enough evidence that her shooting was intentional, so they were forced to accept the district attorney's decision not to charge their father.",
      "Then, seven years after the shooting, in 2020, Pennsylvania State Police investigators Greg Allen and Dan Nilon were assigned to investigate open homicide cases, and this one caught their eye.",
      "\"What about this case stood out to you?\" asked Green. \"To me, it was the original 911 call,\" Corporal Allen explained. \"On the 911 call, I hear three different accounts of what happened.\"",
      "Bruno Rocuba had called 911 to report his wife's shooting, and when the operator asked, \"Was it self-inflicted?\" Rocuba said, \"No, we were fighting.\" Then he nervously changed his story and said that he had been \"playing with the gun\" and accidentally \"let it go off.\"",
      "Rocuba then denied any argument and changed his story a third time. He said that he had been handling the gun because he and his wife were \"going to go shooting,\" and that's when he accidentally pulled the trigger.",
      "Investigators Allen and Nilon then watched the videotape of Rocuba's police walkthrough and interview the day after the shooting, and said they heard several more inconsistencies in Rocuba's explanation of the shooting.",
      "\"There were so many red flags\u2026 that we knew he wasn't telling the truth,\" said Nilon.",
      "Corporal Nilon then did a deep dive into the case and discovered a key piece of evidence that had been collected at the Rocuba home but never been examined. A home security system that had captured footage of Melissa Rocuba's last movements and words.",
      "\"We were able to \u2026 hear \u2026 their last conversation together,\" says Nilon. \"And then a gunshot goes off.\"",
      "\"It may very well be your sister's own voice that ultimately put him behind bars,\" Green commented to Swinney.",
      "\"I never really thought about it like that. Yeah,\" Swinney replied.",
      "On June 3, 2022, nearly nine years after Melissa Rocuba's death, Bruno Rocuba was arrested and charged with her murder.",
      "But two years later, in May 2024, as Bruno Rocuba's trial approached, both sides agreed to a plea deal. Bruno Rocuba pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced to 12 to 40 years behind bars. With time served, he will be up for parole starting in 2035.",

      "But Edgar's court-appointed defense attorney, Rob Hughes, argued that a tiny drop of blood doesn't prove a thing.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How else could that speck have gotten on his pant leg if not coming from blood spatter from the shooting?",
      "Rob Hughes: You can get DNA transferred from just touching someone.",
      "Hughes says there's no telling how long that blood had been there.",
      "And all that blood on Edgar's face that MacDonough swabbed and had tested? It wasn't Livye's or Edgar's \u2014 and once they were excluded, investigators didn't pursue other matches. Hughes says there were additional DNA tests that also raised questions about who else may have been at the crime scene.",
      "Rob Hughes: There were other people's DNA on Matthew, and Livye was excluded as a contributor to those DNA samples.",
      "Hughes tried his best to argue that the DNA should be considered reasonable doubt but admits that his biggest obstacle in defending Edgar were those texts \u2014and Edgar's insistence that he has no memory of sending them.",
      "Peter Van Sant: In your entire career as a defense attorney, have you ever had a client who was functioning during the course of a crime \u2014\u00a0 texting, conversing with people, driving an automobile \u2014\u00a0 then said they had no memory whatsoever of the events?",
      "Rob Hughes: I have not.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you understand why that would be hard for people to believe?",
      "Rob Hughes: Yes.",
      "Hughes also asserted that the murder weapon had not been tested for fingerprints or DNA. But conceded the rifle belonged to Edgar. After a second day of testimony, the prosecutor notified Hughes that he would be resting his case the next morning, and it would then be Hughes' turn to call witnesses. Shaun Dunn says that he had been Snapchatting with Edgar, who was feeling optimistic about his chances.",
      "Shaun Dunn: He was so confident that \u2026 he was gonna need a job \u2026 and asked me \u2026 would I find him a spot to go to work?",
      "But the next morning, as Hughes arrived at the courthouse,. he got a panicked call from Edgar's mother, who told him her son was now a fugitive.",
      "Rob Hughes: She just started \u2026 frantically telling me that Matthew was gone. Matthew had run and he had taken a gun with him. And she was afraid he was gonna kill himself.",
      "Darci Bass: Are you serious? Like he's \u2014 he's gone? He had \u2014 he shouldn't even been out on bond. And he had an ankle monitor on. What happened with that?",
      "Authorities say Edgar had simply waited for the battery on his ankle monitor to die, and then left home \u2014 most likely on foot.",
      "J.P. MacDonough: We started getting assets from all over. \u2026 Lufkin P.D. SWAT, uh, DPS, Texas Rangers \u2026 we even had tracking dogs from the \u2014 from the prison unit \u2026 they followed a trail through the woods, roughly two miles.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar's trial went on without him. That very same day, defense attorney Hughes began presenting his case. The jury was not told that Edgar had fled, but they must have wondered.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, a case that's already very difficult for you has now become, I'll use the word impossible.",
      "Rob Hughes: It \u2014 it made it much \u2014 it \u2014 it didn't help, that's for sure.",
      "No one was surprised when, after deliberating for about an hour-and-a-half, the jury found Edgar guilty of murder. But he was still on the loose, out there somewhere \u2014 an armed threat to himself and the community.",
      "Bayley Williams: I mean I think that it was like a scary time because \u2026 it's Hemphill, he knows where everybody lives at.",
      "Darci Bass: That was a terrible, crazy time for me knowing that he's out there. \u2026 supposedly loved my daughter, but murdered her, and me, the one that's actively trying to make sure that he goes to jail, what would he had done to me.",
      "Bass says it felt like no one was searching for Edgar, so she became a mother on a mission and hung a homemade wanted poster all over town. But she wasn't alone. MacDonough had been joined by Jeff Coulter, a special deputy with the Eastern District U.S. Marshal's Service, and they were on the hunt for Edgar.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Do you consider him right off the bat to be a dangerous fugitive?",

      "Darci Bass: (at the memorial) I just want everyone to remember what happened here \u2026 what Livye had to go through.",
      "It's also a place that Bass is convinced Edgar visited, after becoming a fugitive.",
      "Darci Bass: I just felt it as a mother., I was like he's coming here. He's not far.",
      "Bass says she also heard rumors that Edgar's mother had been spotted buying her son's favorite cigarettes and liquor in large quantities.",
      "Darci Bass: Where is she taking 'em to?",
      "One week after Edgar ran from the law, Jeff Coulter, a special deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service, was asked to take over the manhunt.",
      "Peter Van Sant: When you first \u2026 begin your investigation, do you start with his family? \u2026\u00a0 to see if they've heard anything?",
      "Jeff Coulter: No, no. \u2026 I don't like being lied to. \u2026 I've already heard their stories \u2026 claiming\u00a0 \u2026 she was killed by the cartel \u2026 So, no \u2026 I didn't even waste my time.",
      "Coulter says he quietly spent nearly a year working with the sheriff's office and other law enforcement agencies around the country, to chase down every lead that came their way.",
      "Jeff Coulter: And we had put in a lot of hours, a lot of weekends, a lot of late nights.",
      "Then, a tip that Edgar might actually be hiding in plain sight \u2013 in a house just yards from his grandparent's property.",
      "Jeff Coulter: It looked great, it sounded great. But we physically have to put eyes on him before we make a move on his residence.",
      "The house, which belonged to a family friend, was surrounded by woodlands, so Coulter enlisted the aid of two wardens with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.",
      "The plan? To get as close as possible, under the cloak of darkness, using night vision to ID their man.",
      "Jeff Coulter: We were gonna enter into the woods. Make our way up to the back of the property. Get as close as we could and sit there and see if we could get a visual of him.",
      "While Coulter led a team of three men into the woods, MacDonough and his deputies were on the opposite side of the house, near the driveway \u2014 but out of sight, in their vehicles.",
      "J.P. MacDonough: My job was to sit right there at the front door of that house.",
      "If Coulter and his men made a positive ID on Edgar, they would finally have him cornered.",
      "Jeff Coulter: We went in about 4:30 in the afternoon. We knew it was gonna get dark about 5:30. \u2026 we got into probably about a hundred yards of the house. And \u2014 we heard barking, um, come to find out they had a pretty good-sized Rottweiler in the backyard.",
      "Jeff Coulter: We're out there for an hour or so. \u2026 We could hear voices. \u2026 We hear a female voice. We could hear male voice, but it's so thick. We can't see. \u2026 Then we catch a violent thunderstorm \u2026 And there's lightning and thunder and torrential rain. It was miserable. But it was a blessing in disguise \u2026 the noise covered our movement.",
      "They were 30 yards from the house when a second storm hit, but there was no giving up.",
      "Jeff Coulter: That's 11 months and two days. \u2026 this needed to end tonight.",
      "Drenched and exhausted, Coulter and his team could hear voices on the back porch of the house but couldn't see faces. Until about 8 p.m., when a man stepped off the porch.",
      "Jeff Coulter: Walks around the side of the house and he stands there.",
      "One of Coulter's men immediately recognized that man as Matthew Edgar.",
      "Jeff Coulter: He goes, \"He's here. I got eyes on him.\"",
      "J.P. MacDonough: We got word that they had made a confirmation \u2026 drove down, pulled in the driveway.",
      "Jeff Coulter: Once we saw the lights, it was a 30-yard sprint, all four of us. \u2026 We break the corner, and we started screaming \"law enforcement, police.\" \u2026 He jumps up and he throws himself against the wall, like, oh, crap.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You got me.",
      "Jeff Coulter: Yeah. It was over with.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did you guys make eye contact?",
      "J.P. MacDonough: Absolutely. \u2026 He said, \"Hey, J.P..\" I said, \"Hey, Matthew.\" And then he asked me, \"You haven't \u2026 proven my innocence yet?\" And I said, \"No, Matthew. \u2014 I have not.\"",
      "Coulter says that's not all Edgar had to say that night.",

At the same time, it is just as important to react quickly if they don't meet the needs of our guests.\"",

      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",

      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",

      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",

    "summary": "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement\u200b that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
      "The responses to Mr. Trump's decision ranged from saying it risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" to predicting that \"China and Russia must be having a field day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. Several European countries have sent troops to Greenland in recent days, saying they are there for Arctic security training. Mr. Trump's announcement came Saturday as thousands of Greenlanders were wrapping up a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in the capital, Nuuk.",
      "The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff.",
      "The eight countries issued a joint statement Sunday: \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance,' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"",
      "The statement added: \"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.\"",
      "There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs, because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading. Norway and the U.K. are not part of the 27-member EU, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump's tariffs would impact the entire bloc. EU envoys scheduled emergency talks for Sunday evening to determine a potential response.",
      "It was unclear, too, how Mr. Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a Supreme Court challenge.",
      "European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from the divisions between the U.S. and Europe. She added in a post on social media: \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move also was panned domestically.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot and Democrat who represents Arizona, posted that Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs on U.S. allies would make Americans \"pay more to try to get territory we don't need.\"",
      "\"Troops from European countries are arriving in Greenland to defend the territory from us. Let that sink in,\" he wrote on X. \"The damage this President is doing to our reputation and our relationships is growing, making us less safe. If something doesn't change we will be on our own with adversaries and enemies in every direction.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found widespread opposition among Americans to buying Greenland or taking it by military force. Seventy percent said they would oppose using federal funds to buy the territory, and 86% said they would oppose seizing it militarily.",
      "The tariffs announcement even drew blowback from Mr. Trump's populist allies in Europe.",
      "Italy's right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, considered one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on the continent, said Sunday she had spoken to him about the tariffs, which she described as \"a mistake.\"",
      "The deployment to Greenland of small numbers of troops by some European countries was misunderstood by Washington, Meloni told reporters during a two-day visit to South Korea. She said the deployment was not a move against the U.S. but aimed to provide security against \"other actors\" that she didn't name.",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in France and also a European Parliament lawmaker, posted that the EU should suspend last year's tariff deal with the U.S., describing Mr. Trump's threats as \"commercial blackmail.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also achieved the rare feat of uniting Britain's main political parties \u2014 including the hard-right Reform UK party \u2014 all of whom criticized the tariff threat.",
      "\"We don't always agree with the U.S. government and in this case we certainly don't. These tariffs will hurt us,\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a longtime champion and ally of Mr. Trump, wrote on social media. He stopped short of criticizing Mr. Trump's designs on Greenland.",
      "Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who leads the center-left Labour Party, said the tariffs announcement was \"completely wrong\" and his government would \"be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\"",

    "summary": "The aircraft lost contact with ground control while approaching a mountainous region.",
    "story": [
      "Indonesian rescuers on Sunday recovered a body in an ongoing search for 11 people aboard a regional passenger aircraft that is believed to have crashed the previous day. The plane lost contact with ground control Saturday while approaching a mountainous region between Indonesia's main island of Java and Sulawesi island, officials said.",
      "The rescue team retrieved the body of a man in a ravine about 200 meters, or 656 feet, deep on the slope of Mount Bulusaraung on Sunday afternoon, located near scattered aircraft debris. The evacuation of the body is underway, said Muhammad Arif Anwar, who heads Makassar's Search and Rescue Office and is the mission coordinator.",
      "Teams also found additional wreckage, including parts of the aircraft frame and passenger seats, and visually identified what is believed to be the engine, Anwar said.",
      "The body has not yet been identified, but is believed to have come from the turboprop ATR 42-500 that was on its way from Yogyakarta on Indonesia's main island of Java to Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi province, when it vanished from radar on Saturday shortly after being instructed by air traffic control to correct its approach alignment.",
      "The plane, operated by Indonesia Air Transport, was on the way from Yogyakarta to the capital city of South Sulawesi when it vanished from radar, said Endah Purnama Sari, a spokesperson for the Transportation Ministry. The aircraft was last tracked at 1:17 p.m. local time in the Leang-Leang area of Maros, a mountainous district of South Sulawesi province.",
      "Sari said the plane disappeared shortly after being instructed by air traffic control to correct its approach alignment: \"After the last ATC instructions, radio contact was lost and controllers declared the emergency distress phase.\"",
      "She said rescue teams focused their search around the mountains where the aircraft, with eight crew members and three passengers from the Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry aboard, was believed to have deviated from its approach to Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport. Weather conditions at the time indicated clouds and nearly 5-mile visibility, Sari said.",
      "A rescue team on an air force helicopter on Sunday morning spotted what appeared to be a small aircraft window in a forested area on the slope of Mount Bulusaraung, said Anwar. Rescuers on the ground later retrieved larger debris consistent with the main fuselage and tail scattered on a steep northern slope, Anwar told a news conference.",
      "\"The discovery of the aircraft's main sections significantly narrows the search zone and offers a crucial clue for tightening the search area,\" Anwar said, \"Our joint search and rescue teams are now focusing on searching for the victims, especially those who might still be alive.\"",
      "Multiple search and rescue teams, supported by air force helicopters, drones and ground units, were deployed after the aircraft when missing. Hopes for locating the wreckage grew after hikers on Mount Bulusaraung reported finding scattered debris, a logo consistent with Indonesia Air Transport markings, and small fires still burning at the scene.",
      "\"The sightings were reported to authorities and are being verified by rescue teams attempting to reach the area,\" said Maj. Gen. Bangun Nawoko, the South Sulawesi's Hasanuddin military commander.",
      "Ground and air rescue teams continued moving toward the wreckage site Sunday, despite strong winds, heavy fog and steep rugged terrain that have slowed the search, said Nawoko. The teams, which include more than 100 personnel, supported by the Specialized Search and Rescue Units of the army's elite forces, have been dealing with heavy rain and thick fog with visibility of only about five meters at the summit, according to the military commander.",
      "\"This affected movement and even forced the cancellation of a planned vertical descent for safety,\" Nawoko said.",
      "Photos and videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency on Sunday showed rescuers were trekking along a steep, narrow mountain ridgeline blanketed in thick fog to reach scattered wreckage.",

      "The U.S. official told CBS News that while there is no requirement to join the board, countries can contribute $1 billion if they would like to be permanent members, instead of having just a three-year membership.",
      "The U.S. official also told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza. The official said that \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the board's mandate, adding that there will be no \"exorbitant salaries \"or \"administrative bloat.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-greenland-military-tariffs/",
    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 20:49:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Mr. Trump previously threatened to impose tariffs against countries that do not support his plans to acquire the territory.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on countries that have sent military forces into Greenland amid his push to annex the Arctic island.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that the tariffs will be levied against Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland and take effect on Feb. 1, 2026. All eight countries are members of NATO.",
      "The tariffs will be increased to 25% on June 1, Mr. Trump wrote, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"",
      "There was no forewarning from official channels to U.S. allies and NATO partners before Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday, two European diplomats told CBS News. Officials in those allied nations feel alienated, frustrated and see this as a potential breaking point in the U.S.-Europe relationship, multiple diplomats said. Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel on Tuesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he likely will run into the European leaders he just threatened with tariffs.",
      "CBS News senior foreign correspondent\u00a0Liz Palmer described the Danish soldiers as a \"token force\" and said the military presence \"is a signal to Washington that if Trump is worried about Arctic security, his NATO allies are willing to do their part in helping to look after it.\" On Truth Social, Mr. Trump accused the countries of having \"journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.\"",
      "\"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.\"",
      "In a statement Saturday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democratic lawmakers in the upper chamber would introduce legislation to block \"these tariffs before they do further damage to the American economy and our allies in Europe.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump's foolhardy tariffs have already driven up prices and damaged our economy and now he is only making things worse,\" Schumer wrote. \"It is incredible that he wants to double down on the stupidity by imposing tariffs on our closest allies for his quixotic quest to takeover Greenland.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, also criticized the tariffs early Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies,\" he\u00a0wrote on X. \"It's great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see NATO divided. The fact that a small handful of \"advisors\" are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid. It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the NATO alliance over the years.\"",
      "Thousands of Greenlanders, including Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, took part in a protest march Saturday against Mr. Trump from Greenland's capital city of Nuuk to the U.S. Consulate, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"I thought this day couldn't get any worse but it just did,\" 21-year-old Malik Dollerup-Scheibel said after the AP told him about Mr. Trump's tariff announcement. \"It just shows he has no remorse for any kind of human being now.\"",
      "Thousands of people also protested in front of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.",
      "European leaders react to Trump tariff threats",
      "In a statement posted to X on Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the country is \"committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere,\" and it is on that basis that France \"decided to take part in the exercise organized by Denmark in Greenland.\"",
      "\"Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context,\" Macron said. \"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat to impose tariffs on European nations \"come as a surprise,\" Denmark's foreign minister said Saturday in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,\" said Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs Lars Lokke Rasmussen. \"We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter.\"",
      "Other European leaders are also having discussions to form a joint response, according to Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. In a statement to AFP on Saturday, Kristersson said, \"We won't let ourselves be intimidated.\"",
      "\"I will always defend my country and our allied neighbours,\" he added, stressing that this was \"a European question.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that NATO allies should be working together, adding he will be talking with the Trump administration directly about the tariff threats.",
      "\"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" Starmer said in a statement.",
      "Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 member countries will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday. The meeting was called by Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, according to Reuters.",
      "EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, president of the European Council, said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump's tariffs would \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "\"Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,\" they said, adding that \"the EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.\"",
      "\"Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S.,\" they said.",
      "In a post to LinkedIn, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business and mineral resources, praised the response of European leaders.",
      "\"I am amazed to witness the first responses from the targeted countries,\" Nathanielsen wrote. \"I am thankful and hopeful for diplomacy and allieship to prevail.\"",
      "Trump's interest in Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes the U.S. needs to acquire the island for\u00a0national security reasons. He has said the island is vital for the\u00a0Golden Dome missile defense system\u00a0he intends to build, and has expressed concern about\u00a0Russia or China\u00a0acquiring Greenland. The sparsely populated island is the location of the northernmost U.S. military base and has reserves of\u00a0oil, natural gas and minerals. Its northern position also means it is near\u00a0valuable shipping routes\u00a0that may become even more useful as warm temperatures melt sea ice in the area.",
      "Leaders of the semi-autonomous Danish territory have repeatedly stated that the island is not for sale, and residents of Greenland have protested a potential acquisition.",
      "Mr. Trump's post came as a bipartisan U.S. Congressional delegation attempted to reassure Greenlandic and Danish leaders during a visit to the Arctic island. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said that Greenland needs to be viewed as a U.S. ally, \"not as an asset.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said he was considering tariffs on countries that \"did not go along with\" his plans to acquire Greenland, though he did not offer specifics.",
      "Greenlandic and Danish leaders met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday to discuss long-term security in Greenland. Denmark and the U.S. still have \"fundamental\" disagreements about Greenland's future, Denmark's foreign minister said that afternoon, but a working group to discuss cooperation was established. A Danish official told CBS that Denmark offered more security access and greater defense investment. The official added that Denmark has set two things as a red line: territorial integrity and self-determination for Greenlanders.",
      "The White House has not ruled out the use of military force to take the island, despite warnings from Denmark that doing so would be seen as a threat to the NATO alliance.",
      "Margaret  Brennan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed President Trump for the deaths and injuries of protestors during recent demonstrations that shook the Middle Eastern country.",
      "\"We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,\" he said, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. Khamenei was speaking to a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday.",
      "Khamenei also described the protests as an \"American conspiracy\" and accused the United States of trying to \"put Iran back under military, political and economic domination.\" He also called Mr. Trump a \"criminal,\" Reuters said.",
      "\"The latest anti-Iran \u200dsedition was different in that the U.S. president \u2060personally became involved,\" Khamenei said, according to Reuters.",
      "The protests began as demonstrations against economic hardship and snowballed quickly into nationwide protests against the Islamic Republic's leadership.",
      "The demonstrations raged for more than two weeks before authorities began a brutal crackdown. Iran's Internet was shut down late last week, and information from within the country is still hard to come by. Two sources inside the Islamic Republic, including one inside Iran who was able to call out of the country on Tuesday, told CBS News that at least 12,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 people are feared to have been killed. Thousands of others were arrested and are now\u00a0facing possible death sentences\u00a0for taking part in the demonstrations.",
      "Senior foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab said on \"CBS Saturday Morning\" that sources inside Iran have described a nation \"gripped with fear and in deep mourning.\"",
      "\"We've had accounts of mass funerals and bodies buried in unmarked graves,\" Tyab said. The worst of the violence reportedly came during what's being called \"The Night of Blood\" last Thursday, he said.",
      "Sources say there is now relative calm during the day, Tyab said, though chants of \"death to the dictator\" rise from rooftops at night.",
      "Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that there would be \"very strong actions\" against the Iranian regime if it hanged accused protestors. He said in the Oval Office on Wednesday that \"we have been told that the killing in Iran is stopping, it has stopped, it's stopping.\"",
      "\"They've said the killing has stopped and the executions won't take place,\" he said, citing \"very important sources on the other side\" but not giving any specifications. \"There were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won't take place. And we're going to find out.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump even took the unusual step of thanking the Iranian government for not following through on executions of what he said were meant to be hundreds of political prisoners.",
      "\"Iran canceled the hanging of over 800 people,\" he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, adding that he \"greatly respected\" the move.",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly expressed his support for the protestors and told Iranians that \"help is on its way.\" The Trump administration says the president has a\u00a0range of options\u00a0at his disposal, from conventional military strikes to cyber warfare.",

      "The FBI plans to extradite Alejandro Rosales Castillo, 27, who was wanted in the killing nine years ago of a woman he worked with at a North Carolina restaurant, Truc Quan \"Sandy\" Ly Le.",
      "The news comes as President Trump has threatened action against Mexican drug cartels by U.S. forces. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, spoke with Mr. Trump on Monday. A United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed then-president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month fueled speculation Mr. Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Mexico and Cuba.",
      "In 2016, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said Le, 23, was Castillo's former girlfriend. Authorities found her vehicle at a bus station in Phoenix, Arizona, on August 15, 2016, and found her body on August 17, 2016, in a wooded area in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, with a gunshot wound to her head, The Charlotte Observer reported at the time.",

      "Castillo was arrested in Mexico on Friday and will be extradited to North Carolina, officials told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan U.S. Congressional delegation sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support amid President Trump's push to take control of the strategic Arctic island.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said that Greenland needs to be viewed as a U.S. ally, \"not as an asset,\" while Sen. Chris Coons said they want to de-escalate the situation.",
      "\"I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said in Copenhagen, adding that the U.S. has respect for Denmark and NATO \"for all we've done together.\"",
      "Their comments contrasted with those emanating from the White House. Mr. Trump has floated a U.S. takeover of Greenland for months, pointing to the island's strategically valuable location. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals.",
      "The Trump administration has not ruled out taking the island by military force.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would be imposing 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European countries because of their opposition to his administration's plans for Greenland.",
      "He said in a social media post that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would face the tariff, which would be raised to 25% on June 1 if a deal is not in place for \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.",
      "The gambit has drawn strong pushback from officials in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe.",
      "Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen\u00a0said\u00a0earlier this week that \"we choose Denmark,\" and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0has said\u00a0a U.S. takeover would effectively mean the end of NATO.",
      "\"It undermines NATO at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, in Denmark.",
      "European leaders have insisted it is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.",
      "\"There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,\" Coons said. \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\"",
      "Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week\u00a0with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "That encounter didn't resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group \u2014 on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.",
      "And as this Arctic fight over Greenland's future heats up, many of its nearly 60,000 people are scared.",
      "\"The Americans used to be the good guys; they helped us, but now they all of a sudden are our enemy and that is a shock,\" said Liv Aurora Jensen.",
      "Thousands of people marched through Copenhagen, many of them carrying Greenland's flag, on Saturday afternoon in support of the self-governing island. Others held signs with slogans like \"Make America Smart Again\" and \"Hands Off.\"",
      "\"This is important for the whole world,\" Danish protester Elise Riechie told The Associated Press as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. \"There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.\"",

      "Syrian government forces entered two northern towns Saturday morning after the command of Kurdish-led fighters said it would evacuate the area in an apparent move to avoid conflict.",
      "Two soldiers were killed and others wounded in the latest clash, state media reported. The town of Deir Hafer changed hands after deadly fighting erupted earlier this month between government troops and the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the city of Aleppo, Syria's largest. It ended with the evacuation of Kurdish fighters from three neighborhoods taken over by government forces.",
      "An Associated Press reporter on Saturday saw government tanks, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles, including pickup trucks with heavy machine guns mounted on top, entering Deir Hafer after bulldozers removed barriers. There was no SDF presence on the edge of the town.",
      "The Syrian military said its forces were in full control of Deir Hafer, captured the Jarrah air base to the east, and were in the process of clearing mines and explosives. It added that troops would move toward the nearby town of Maskana, where an AP reporter saw a military convoy rolling in hours later.",
      "The SDF said in a statement that according to an agreement, Syrian forces were supposed to enter Deir Hafer and Maskana after the Kurdish-led force ended their withdrawal. \"Damascus violated the terms of the agreement and entered the towns before our fighters had fully withdrawn, creating a highly dangerous situation with potentially serious repercussions,\" the SDF said.",
      "State news agency SANA reported that SDF fighters \"violated the agreement\" by targeting an army patrol near Maskana, leaving two soldiers dead and others wounded. SANA added that government forces kept moving east, reaching two villages in the northern province of Raqqa.",
      "Over the past two days, more than 11,000 people fled Deir Hafer and Maskana using side roads to reach government-controlled areas, after the government announced an offensive to take the towns.",
      "On Friday night, after government forces started pounding SDF positions in Deir Hafer, the Kurdish-led fighters' top commander\u00a0Mazloum Abdi\u00a0posted on X that his group would withdraw from contested areas in northern Syria. Abdi said SDF fighters would relocate east of the Euphrates River starting 7 a.m. local time Saturday.",
      "The easing of tension came after U.S. military officials visited Deir Hafer on Friday and held talks with SDF officials in the area. The United States has good relations with both sides and has urged calm.",
      "Abdi was scheduled to hold talks with U.S. special special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on Saturday.",
      "The SDF's decision to withdraw from Deir Hafer was made after Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree Friday boosting the rights of the country's Kurds, who made up about 10% of Syria's population of 23 million before the conflict began in 2011. Over the past decades, Syria's Kurds had been marginalized and deprived of their cultural rights under the rule of the Baath Party that ran Syria for six decades until Bashar Assad's fall in December 2024.",
      "Al-Sharaa's decree recognized Kurdish as a national language, along with Arabic, and adopted the Newroz festival, a traditional celebration of spring and renewal marked by Kurds around the region, as an official holiday.",
      "The Kurdish-led authority in northeast Syria said Saturday that the rights of Kurds should not be protected by \"temporary decrees\" but by mentioning them in the country's constitution. It added that a decree \"does not form a real guarantee for rights of Syria's ethnic groups.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the death of a Mexican citizen in an immigration detention facility this week in Georgia, as Mexican authorities sought details surrounding the circumstances of the incident.",
      "On Wednesday, Heber Sanchez Dom\u00ednguez, a 34-year-old Mexican citizen, died while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, DHS said in a statement Friday. The cause of death is currently under investigation.",
      "Sanchaz was in ICE custody for six days and was awaiting a hearing when he was discovered \"hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters\" at about 2:05 a.m. local time, DHS said. Medical staff immediately attempted lifesaving measures and then transported him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead about one hour later.",
      "ICE said it first encountered Sanchez on Jan. 7 after he was arrested for driving without a license, DHS said. Two days later, on Jan. 9, ICE filed a notice requiring Sanchez to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "DHS said Sanchez entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 22, 2023, at or near Nogales, Arizona. Border Patrol agents arrested him that same day and issued him a notice to appear. He was later released without bond.",
      "After his Jan. 7 arrest, ICE transferred Sanchez to the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center as he awaited removal proceedings. Medical staff conducted an intake evaluation and reported no signs of distress at the time.",
      "On Thursday, Mexico's consulate in Atlanta said it was \"closely monitoring\" the death of a Mexican citizen Wednesday at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility and was maintaining \"permanent communication\" with the ICE field office in Atlanta.",
      "Mexican officials requested \"that the circumstances of the incident be clarified,\" the consulate said, adding that it was \"collaborating on the necessary procedures to ensure that the investigation is conducted promptly and transparently.\"",

      "Last year, 2025, was the deadliest year for ICE detainees in two decades, with at least 30 people dying in detention centers. At least four people have died in ICE detention so far this year, according to agency data.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan congressional delegation met with Danish and Greenlandic officials in Copenhagen Friday in an effort to show support for Greenland's territorial integrity despite President Trump's continued push\u00a0to acquire the island.",
      "The delegation is led by Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, and Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. Addressing reporters after the meeting, Coons said that the delegation \"spoke about the value of NATO and the commitment to respecting the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination.\"",
      "\"And we spoke with clarity about the importance of the people of Greenland make their decisions about their future. So, it was a constructive and hopeful dialogue,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said Greenland needs to be treated as \"our ally, not as an asset.\"",
      "\"It is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, 'We do not think that that is a good idea,'\" Murkowski told reporters. \"This senator from Alaska does not think it is a good idea.\"",
      "Murkowski said Congress has some tools at their disposal, particularly the power of the purse, to address the Greenland issue, although she emphasized the goal of the trip is to hear directly from the people of Greenland and Denmark.",
      "The White House had said Thursday that discussions involving Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials in Washington earlier this week were \"technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland.\" That claim has been strongly rejected by Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, who told Danish broadcaster TV2 that if the U.S. side comes to more talks with that mindset then it will be a \"a very, very short series of meetings.\"",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry told Fox News Friday that he believes a deal can be achieved on the U.S. acquiring Greenland and that he plans to visit the island in March.",
      "\"The president is serious. I think he's laid the markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, and now it's a matter of having Secretary Rubio and Vice President JD Vance make a deal,\" Landry said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Greenland\u2014 the world's largest island, which lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans \u2014 is a self-governing Danish territory. Its strategic location and natural resources have attracted growing attention from President Trump.",
      "The leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly rejected\u00a0the idea of a U.S. takeover of the island. Earlier this week Rasmussen, Denmark's top diplomat, said his country and the U.S. still had \"fundamental\" differences over Greenland's future but would continue to talk.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to control the vast, largely frozen island for national security reasons, to counter the geopolitical threat posed by Russia and China. The president has not ruled out seizing the territory through military force.",
      "Speaking at the University of Copenhagen Friday, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is taking part in the congressional visit, told attendees that \"millions of Americans are deeply concerned by the recent rhetoric about the United States taking over Greenland, either buying it or using military force.\"",
      "\"That rhetoric doesn't just undermine our bilateral relationship, it undermines the NATO Alliance at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division,\" Shaheen said. \"(Russian President) Vladimir Putin would welcome any move that fractures NATO or diverts attention and resources away from Ukraine,\" Shaheen said.",
      "Denmark is a member of the U.S.-led military alliance and several NATO members have expressed concern about the Trump administration's rhetoric regarding Greenland.",
      "On Thursday, Danish soldiers arrived there, as did troops from NATO partners including France, Germany and the Netherlands in an effort to bolster the island's security.",
      "\"At the request of Denmark, I have decided that France will participate in the joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland, Operation Arctic Endurance,\" French president Emmanuel Macron said in a social media post Wednesday.",
      "Speaking to reporters at a press briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the presence of European troops in Greenland doesn't impact Mr. Trump's \"goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said \"Greenland belongs to its people\" in a joint statement, while stressing that America's NATO allies are taking security in the Arctic region seriously.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the statement said.",
      "Potential military action by the United States in Greenland could jeopardize the eight-decade-old NATO alliance. Under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an armed attack against one NATO member is considered an attack against the entire alliance. Any U.S. action in Greenland could undermine that central principle.",
      "Article 5 has been triggered only once in history, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. In the subsequent U.S. led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, NATO allies including Denmark provided military support to the United States on the ground.",

    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing \"compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.",
      "The comments come after President Trump threatened action against Mexican drug cartels by U.S. forces last week. Mr. Trump told Fox News last week that the United States had \"knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water\" and that the U.S. was \"going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.\" The Trump administration has also begun to\u00a0add militarized zones to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a \"cool head,\" has sought to placate Mr. Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. A dramatic\u00a0United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed\u00a0former president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in early January set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Mr. Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.",
      "On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed \"more must be done to confront shared threats.\"",
      "Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. Mexican authorities seized over 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine from clandestine laboratories in the country earlier this week.",
      "She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\"There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,\" she said.",
      "She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.",

      "Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump also spoke by phone on Monday. Sheinbaum said it was a \"very good conversation.\"",

    "summary": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.",
      "Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.",
      "Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\"Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.",
      "Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,\" China's top leader said.",
      "Carney looks to improve global governance",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \"under great strain.\"",
      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",
      "The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.",

    "story": [
      "CIA director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez for two hours Thursday in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, to \"deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship,\" a U.S. official told CBS News Friday.",
      "The official described the trip as historic, noting that Ratcliffe was the first Cabinet-level official to visit Venezuela since the U.S. military operation to remove the country's autocratic leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro nearly two weeks ago.",
      "At the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, Ratcliffe was said to convey a warning that Venezuela must stop supporting drug trafficking.",
      "\"During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,\" the official said.",
      "The meeting came the same day that President Trump met with Venezuela's opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado at the White House.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has publicly praised Machado, the administration appears to view Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 who was vice president under Maduro \u2014\u00a0 as more capable of maintaining stability in Venezuela in the near term.",
      "That aligns with the findings of a CIA analytic assessment that modeled potential political leadership scenarios in Venezuela if Maduro were no longer president, CBS News can confirm. The analysis, which was closely held and briefed to a limited group of senior administration officials, concluded that existing Maduro-aligned officials \u2014 including Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 would be best positioned to maintain short-term stability.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearings last year, Ratcliffe promised that, as he put it, the agency would be less risk-averse under his leadership.

    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for more than\u00a0two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with demonstrations in at least 185 cities around the country. An internet blackout impeded communications and made it difficult to know the scope of the protests \u2014 or the crackdown that appeared to be escalating.",
      "Estimates of the death toll jumped sharply on Jan. 13. Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in Parliament that the U.K. government believed there \"may have been 2,000 people killed, there have been more. My fear is that the number may prove to be significantly higher.\"",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, told CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed. Activist groups were working to compile a full death toll based on reports from medical officials across the country. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the massive death toll indicated by the source inside Iran.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "Protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media night after night showed crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA, and the death toll rose as protests entered their third week.",
      "CBS News has verified that video posted online shows the bodies of at least 366 and likely more than 400 people killed amid the protest piled up at a morgue in a Tehran suburb. The video appears to show forensic personnel documenting gruesome injuries on the bodies, and crowds of people seemingly trying to identify the dead.",
      "The injuries visible are extensive and include gunshot wounds, \"birdshot\" shotgun wounds, gashes and other severe injuries.",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press \u2014 a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access beginning Jan. 8\u00a0across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued into Jan. 11, writing on social media that \"national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels.\"",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order U.S. action of some kind if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "He told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in an interview Jan. 13 that the U.S. will \"take very strong action\" if Iranian authorities begin hanging anti-government protesters. He said \"there's a lot of help on the way\" for Iranian citizens, saying it's being offered in \"different forms,\" including economic assistance.",
      "A few days earlier, the\u00a0president wrote\u00a0on Truth Social: \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for a potential response, which could include military or cyber actions.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi \u2014 whose father, the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power \u2014 has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

      "\"One of the hardest things about shooting '24' is that I work with some amazing actors and pretty much everybody gets killed,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter in December 2008. \"So you get used to working with people you develop an unbelievable relationship with \u2014 not only professionally but personally as well \u2014 and then their characters die.\"",

      "\"The songs that I wrote are stories from my life. They're the closest thing I have to a journal,\" he told the BBC in May 2019. \"One of the most awkward moments I've ever had as a performer was the first show I ever played, realizing I didn't have a character that was separating me from the audience. And once I kind of got comfortable enough to lean in to that, it became the most freeing experience as a performer that I've ever had.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.",
      "Belle Burden has seemingly led a charmed life. She was born into a prominent, wealthy New York family, became a corporate lawyer and went on to marry and have three children.",
      "But in 2020, behind the scenes, her life fell apart when her husband of 21 years, hedge fund executive Henry Davis, told her he wanted a divorce after she learned he was having an affair.",
      "In her new memoir, \"Strangers: A Memoir of Marriage,\" Burden goes into intimate detail about how she discovered the affair and the messy aftermath and how she survived it all.",
      "NEW YORK HEIRESS BELLE BURDEN RECOUNTS THE VOICEMAIL THAT TORCHED HER HUSBAND'S DOUBLE LIFE: MEMOIR",
      "Belle Burden and her former husband, seen here in 2008, were married in 1999. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "The voicemail",
      "In March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic began shutting down New York City, Burden and her husband, who she refers to as James in her book, made the decision to leave their family home and stay in their house on Martha's Vineyard.",
      "With their two youngest children, daughters Evie, 15, and Carrie, 12 (their oldest child, son Finn, 17, stayed on Long Island with friends), they began their lockdown like many others, watching the news regularly and trying to navigate the unique situation.",
      "On the evening of March 21, she got a phone call but let it go to voicemail since she didn't recognize the number. When she listened to it, she heard a man who she described as sounding nervous, who said, \"I\u2019m trying to reach Belle. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but your husband is having an affair with my wife.\"",
      "She recalled being frozen for a moment, then went to find James, assuming there was some misunderstanding. He had been looking for her at the same time, and when they found each other, she wrote that he took her into the guest bedroom, sat her down, and said, \"I promise you, this meant nothing. It\u2019s over. I love you and only you. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\"",
      "He told her the affair had only been going on a few weeks, and that the woman was a banker he'd met through work. The conversation was interrupted by her younger daughter, and, later, Burden sent a text to the man who'd left the voicemail, asking him how long the affair had been going on.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Burden's book was released earlier this week. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "She wrote that he texted back with, \"I think a month. But I can\u2019t text because my wife has tried to kill herself. She\u2019s in an ambulance.\"",
      "When she found James again, she said he was on the phone with the woman, and he told her that she'd taken \"a few sleeping pills\" and would be fine. Burden went through the rest of the night in a bit of a daze, struggling to process everything, and at 6 a.m. the next morning, James came into their bedroom in the same clothes he'd been wearing the night before and told her he decided he wanted a divorce.",
      "Telling the children",
      "After telling her he wanted a divorce, Burden wrote that James left the Martha's Vineyard home and became distant and cold despite her attempts to communicate with him. He didn't tell their children goodbye before leaving, he refused therapy and he allegedly texted her, \"I\u2019ll answer what I want, when I want. I\u2019ll speak when I want. I\u2019ll decide when I want.\"",
      "Despite his reluctance to talk through everything, she wrote that he did tell her that he wanted to tell people that their decision to divorce was amicable. She refused, and in late April, weeks after he left, she told him that they needed to tell their children the news.",
      "He initially suggested she tell them alone, and she agreed. Later, his boss contacted her, suggesting it was important for James to be there for the conversation. He lent James his private plane so he could return to Martha's Vineyard from where he was staying in Connecticut.",
      "They told their son first over the phone, and she said he hung up at some point during the conversation without either she or James realizing. When he arrived at the house, he told her he only had 90 minutes before he needed to get back on the plane. They gathered in the living room with their daughters, and he told them, \"Mom and I are separated, and we\u2019re going to divorce. I haven\u2019t been happy.\"",
      "Belle Burden with one of her daughters. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "Their 12-year-old ran out of the room crying, while their 15-year-old remained silent on the couch. Burden wrote that James then turned to her and said, \"I\u2019m starving, can you make me a sandwich?\"",
      "She recalled being shocked by the question but agreed, asking him to go find Carrie. When she was done making the sandwich, she found each of her daughters alone in separate rooms, and James in the basement, going through boxes. When she asked him what he was doing, she said he responded, \"I\u2019m looking for our prenup. If you have it, you have to give it to me.\"",
      "\"I stood there, at the top of the basement stairs, holding the plate, watching him. I told him to stop, to be with the girls during his remaining minutes in the house, but he continued, pulling box after box off the shelves,\" she wrote. \"His duffel sat open on the floor beside the boxes, ready to receive what he found.\"",
      "The prenup had gone missing in the 21 years since they'd first signed it. He gave up the hunt when he had to leave for the airport, and she took her daughters to get takeout after he left.",
      "Later that evening, she got a text from him that said, \"That was a great visit!\"",
      "Giving up custody",
      "Throughout the book, Burden described the change in James after he told her he wanted a divorce. At times, she wrote, she struggled to recognize him as the man she'd known for decades.",
      "When their children were young, she devoted all her time and energy to raising them while James focused on his career, often joking, \"I don\u2019t do bath, bed or homework.\" While he didn't deal with the daily work of parenting, he did pay attention to them, she wrote, taking them on special outings and trips regularly.",
      "But in one of the conversations they had shortly after he left her, Burden wrote that he told her, \"You can have the house and the apartment. You can have custody of the kids. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want any of it.\"",
      "Initially, she and the children stayed in the Martha's Vineyard house while he stayed in their apartment in the city, but in May 2020, he told her that he'd purchased a new two-bedroom apartment.",
      "Burden with her stepmother, Susan, and her ex-husband. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "She wrote, \"I looked at the sales website for the building, at the model two-bedroom floor plan and photos. It looked modern and expensive. But a two-bedroom? Would he be able to fit all three kids in one bedroom? I still thought he would want to make a home for them, that he wouldn\u2019t follow through with his decision to have no custody, no overnights. Even if he refused formal custody, I thought the kids would stay with him now and then, that Carrie would go there after school when she chose to, that she would have a room to sleep in, that he would give her a key.\"",
      "When he moved into the apartment in February 2021, he turned the second bedroom into a home office. She said that he kept in touch with the kids through texts and occasionally took them to dinner, \"but he continued to refuse a daily role in their lives.\"",
      "Burden had her lawyer sent James a custody agreement, one that gave them each 50/50 custody, assuming he \"would have realized his mistake\" in not seeking more time with their children by then. Instead, she wrote, \"James returned the document stripped of all his time, including vacations, holidays, weeks during the summer. He included only dinner on Thursday nights.\"",
      "She admitted that she believes James genuinely thought he was being \"selfless\" by not making the official agreement and that he argued their children were old enough to decide for themselves when they wanted to see him. For bigger moments, like when their son had surgery, she said that he showed up, but \"for everyday issues, he responded with irritation.\"",
      "Eventually, even the Thursday night dinner stopped, and she stopped trying to press him to spend more time with their children, fearing it was \"dangerous\" to expose her children to \"more hurt, more rejection\" from their father.",
      "Court battle",
      "Before Burden met James, she'd signed a contract with her mother, promising to get a prenup before she got married. Two months before her wedding, her family lawyer sent a draft of the agreement to her. In that agreement, anything either brought into the marriage would remain their own in case of divorce, but anything earned during the marriage and anything in joint name would be split.",
      "She said James was \"upset\" by the prenup, and she ignored it for weeks, but eventually he suggested an amendment. Instead of splitting everything earned during the marriage, they'd only split the things that were under both of their names.",
      "Her lawyer advised against it, telling her it was a \"bad idea,\" but she insisted, and that was the way their prenup was designed.",
      "In July 2019, less than a year before their marriage fell apart, Burden and James had a meeting with their lawyer, and one of the things they'd planned on doing was dissolving the prenup because it was no longer fair to her. James had become incredibly successful in his career while she'd put hers on hold to raise the children, and she'd emptied her trusts, which would have been protected regardless of a prenup, to purchase their homes in New York City and Martha's Vineyard.",
      "Burden is the granddaughter of New York socialite Babe Paley. (Getty Images)",
      "She wrote, \"He said, \u2018Let\u2019s table the prenup for now. We have too many other things to do. Let\u2019s focus on the wills. I want to leave everything to you. Not in trust for the kids.\u2019\"",
      "She recalled being \"touched\" by the notion, but when they met with their lawyer and conversation about the wills came up, he cut the meeting short, saying he had to get back to work.",
      "They never adjusted their wills, nor did they get rid of the prenup, and when he filed for divorce, he continued paying for the family's expenses, with her providing annotated credit card bills and him approving any bigger purchases. In January 2021, as part of the divorce proceedings, she received a series of documents detailing his earnings throughout the marriage, and she was shocked to find that he was much more financially successful than she knew \u2014 not because he ever hid it, she admitted, but just because she hadn't looked into it.",
      "She and her lawyer filed a counterclaim in the divorce case, although they knew with the prenup they didn't have much of a chance at being successful with it. In July of that year, the judge dismissed it, and James, who hadn't brought up the counterclaim to her directly, was \"inflamed\" that she'd tried to go against him.",
      "\"He said he would give me only the minimum child support required by law,\" she wrote. \"He said I would have to face the consequences of the prenup, of my failed counterclaim.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "His lawyer sent her a letter, assuming that she'd want to buy James out of his claim on both houses she'd bought with her family trust, which she couldn't afford to do. At this point, although she'd been struggling greatly with the breakdown of her marriage, things \"became very dark,\" so much that she began experiencing suicidal ideation.",
      "In October 2021, just an hour before the trial was set to begin, Burden and James reached a settlement. He agreed to give up his interest in both of their homes, and he pays child support and covers medical expenses and school tuition. He did keep the money he accumulated during their marriage.",
      "Burden's parents are publisher Carter Burden and urban planner Amanda Burden. (Horst P. Horst/Conde Nast via Getty Images)",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what finally made him decide to settle,\" she wrote. \"I have several guesses, but I will never know for sure. Maybe he always planned to resolve it before trial, to give me the house and the apartment. But only after he brought me to my knees.\"",
      "The aftermath",
      "Burden admitted she doesn't know much about James' life now. She doesn't know how long he stayed with the other woman or if he's still with her. She does know he hasn't remarried, and that while he is \"kind and loving\" to their children, he hasn't had an overnight visit or a vacation or holiday with any of them since he left.",

      "\"I don\u2019t know if he cheated throughout our marriage or if she was his first and only affair,\" she admitted. \"I don\u2019t know if he made the decision to leave suddenly after being caught, or if he\u2019d carefully planned his exit for years. I don\u2019t know what role the pandemic played. I don\u2019t know how much of it was about money. I don\u2019t know how much of it was about me.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know why he left. I don\u2019t think I ever will.\"",

      "EATING MEAT COULD PROTECT AGAINST CANCER-RELATED DEATH, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "The red meat itself wasn\u2019t the problem, Michaels suggested \u2014 it was about the saturated fat in the red meat. \"So now, the conversation comes down to: Is saturated fat good for you or bad for you?\"",
      "The expert emphasized that saturated fat is \"unquestionably better\" than refined vegetable oils, due to the extraction process that exposes the oils to unhealthy chemicals.",
      "\"The food pyramid has been effectively inverted. This is wonderful. This is long overdue,\" Michaels told Fox News Digital. (iStock; Getty Images)",

      "The powerful law allows the president to \"take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress [an] insurrection\" when state officials are unwilling or unable to.

      "His remarks come as protests and instances of vandalism and violence continue to rock Minneapolis.

      "The shooting happened after DHS deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of Operation Metro Surge, which has led to at least 2,000 arrests, according to court papers filed as part of a lawsuit Minnesota\u2019s leaders brought against the administration over the crackdown.",

      "Trump federalized the National Guard under Title 10, a separate statute, to respond to anti-ICE activity in Illinois and Oregon, but the Supreme Court recently halted those deployments.",

    "summary": "The Rictor X4 electric aircraft promises personal flight for $39,900, making eVTOL technology accessible with 50 mph speeds and truck-bed portability.",
    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A new malware campaign is turning WhatsApp Web into a weapon. Security researchers say a banking Trojan linked to Astaroth is now spreading automatically through chat messages, making the attack harder to stop once it starts.",
      "The campaign is known as Boto Cor-de-Rosa. It shows how cybercriminals keep evolving, especially when they can abuse tools people trust every day. This attack focuses on Windows users and uses WhatsApp Web as both the delivery system and the engine that spreads the infection further.",

      "BROWSER EXTENSION MALWARE INFECTED 8.8M USERS IN DARKSPECTRE ATTACK",
      "Attackers abuse the WhatsApp Web to spread malware through messages that appear to come from people you trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this WhatsApp Web attack works",
      "The attack starts with a simple message. A contact sends what looks like a routine ZIP file through WhatsApp. The file name appears random and harmless, which lowers suspicion. Once opened, the ZIP contains a Visual Basic script disguised as a normal document. If the user runs it, the script quietly pulls in two more pieces of malware. Then the script downloads the Astaroth banking malware written in Delphi. It also installs a Python-based module designed to control WhatsApp Web. Both components run in the background without obvious warning signs. From there, the infection becomes self-sustaining.",
      "Malware that spreads itself through your contacts",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is how it propagates. The Python module scans the victim's WhatsApp contacts and sends the malicious ZIP file to every conversation automatically. Researchers at Acronis found that the malware adapts its messages based on the time of day. It sends friendly greetings, making the message feel normal and familiar. The text says, \"Here is the requested file. If you have any questions, I'm available!\" Because the message appears to come from someone you know, many people open it without hesitation.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "A single ZIP file sent through chat can quietly install banking malware and begin spreading to every contact. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Built-in tracking keeps the attack efficient",
      "This malware is carefully designed to monitor its own performance in real time. The propagation tool tracks how many messages are successfully delivered, how many fail to send and the overall sending speed measured per minute. After every 50 messages, it generates progress updates that show how many contacts have been reached. This feedback allows attackers to measure success quickly and make adjustments if something stops working.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "The initial script is heavily obfuscated to avoid detection by antivirus tools. Once it runs, it launches PowerShell commands that download more malware from compromised websites. One known domain used in this campaign is coffe-estilo.com. The malware installs itself inside a folder that mimics a Microsoft Edge cache directory. Inside are executable files and libraries that make up the full Astaroth banking payload. From there, the malware can steal credentials, monitor activity and potentially access financial accounts.",
      "Why WhatsApp Web is being abused",
      "WhatsApp Web is popular because it mirrors your phone conversations on a computer. That convenience makes it easy to send messages, share files and type faster, but it also introduces risk. When you use WhatsApp Web, you link your phone to a browser by scanning a QR code at web.whatsapp.com. Once connected, that browser session becomes a trusted extension of your account. Your chats appear on the screen, messages you send come from your real number and incoming messages sync across both devices.",
      "That setup is exactly what attackers take advantage of. If malware gains access to a computer with WhatsApp Web logged in, it can act as the user. It can read messages, access contact lists and send files or links that look completely legitimate. The messages do not raise alarms because they are coming from a real account, not a fake one.",
      "This is what turns WhatsApp Web into an effective delivery system for malware. Instead of breaking into WhatsApp itself, attackers simply abuse an open browser session to spread malicious files automatically.",
      "Many users do not realize the danger because WhatsApp Web feels harmless. It is often left signed in on work computers, shared devices or systems without strong security. In those situations, malware does not need advanced tricks. It only needs access to an already trusted session. That combination of convenience and trust is why WhatsApp Web has become such an attractive target.",
      "MALICIOUS MAC EXTENSIONS STEAL CRYPTO WALLETS AND PASSWORDS",
      "Once the WhatsApp Web is compromised, malware can act like the user, sending messages and files that look completely legitimate.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web malware",
      "Attacks like this WhatsApp Web malware are designed to spread fast through trusted conversations. A few smart habits can dramatically lower your risk.",
      "Messaging apps feel casual, which is exactly why attackers use them. Never open ZIP files sent through chat unless you confirm with the sender first. Watch for file names made of random numbers or unfamiliar names.\u00a0Treat messages that create urgency or feel overly familiar as a warning sign. If a file arrives out of nowhere, pause before clicking.",
      "This campaign abuses WhatsApp Web to spread automatically once a device is infected. Check active WhatsApp Web sessions and log out of any you do not recognize. Avoid leaving WhatsApp Web signed in on shared or public computers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) inside WhatsApp settings. Cutting off Web access helps limit how far malware can travel.",
      "This type of malware takes advantage of systems that fall behind on updates. Install Windows updates as soon as they are available. Also, keep your web browser fully updated. Staying current closes many of the doors attackers try to slip through. In addition, use strong antivirus software that watches for script abuse and PowerShell activity in real time.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Banking malware often pairs with identity theft and financial fraud. One way to reduce the fallout is by shrinking your digital footprint. A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites that attackers often search. With less information available, criminals have fewer details to exploit if malware reaches your device.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Even with strong security habits, financial monitoring adds another layer of protection. An identity theft protection service can watch for suspicious activity tied to your credit and personal data. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "You should also turn on alerts for bank and credit card transactions so you are notified quickly if something looks wrong. The less exposed your data is, the fewer opportunities attackers have to cause damage.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most malware infections happen because people act too quickly. If a message feels off, trust that instinct. Familiar names and friendly language can lower your guard, but they should never replace caution. Take a moment to verify the message or file before opening anything. Attackers rely on trust and urgency to succeed. Slowing down takes away their advantage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This WhatsApp Web malware campaign is a reminder that cyberattacks no longer rely on obvious red flags. Instead, they blend into everyday conversations and use familiar tools to spread quietly and quickly. What makes this threat especially concerning is how little effort it takes for it to move from one device to dozens of others.",
      "A single click can turn a trusted chat into a delivery system for banking malware and identity theft. The good news is that small changes make a big difference. Paying attention to attachments, locking down WhatsApp Web access, keeping devices updated and slowing down before clicking can stop these attacks cold. As messaging platforms continue to play a bigger role in daily life, staying alert is no longer optional. Awareness and simple habits remain some of the strongest defenses you have.",

      "The device measures volatile organic compounds, especially acetone, which has long been associated with rising blood glucose. That sweet fruity breath is a known marker of diabetes. By detecting changes in those compounds, isaac can alert users to potential glucose events. The device is small, about the size of a quarter, with a loop so it can be worn on a lanyard or clipped to clothing or a bag.",
      "The breath-based design is intended to reduce how often users need finger-prick blood tests, while providing early alerts for glucose-related changes.",
      "The device is named after the inventor's grandson, Isaac, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at just 2 years old. The inventor, Bud Wilcox, wanted to reduce the number of painful finger pricks his grandson faced each day. That personal motivation led to years of collaboration with scientists, designers and engineers. Research and development included work with Indiana University under the direction of Dr. M. Agarwal. The goal was simple but ambitious: Alert families to blood sugar events earlier while reducing the physical and emotional toll of constant testing.",
      "How the isaac device fits into daily life",

      "PreEvnt first introduced isaac publicly at CES 2025. Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials.\u00a0Those studies compare isaac's breath-based alerts with traditional blood glucose monitoring methods.",
      "Trials began with adolescents who have Type 1 diabetes and later expanded to adults with Type 2 diabetes. The company is now working toward regulatory review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because this technology is new, PreEvnt is pursuing a de novo pathway, which allows devices to be evaluated while standards are still being defined. According to the company, regulators have shown strong interest as the data continues to come in.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Noninvasive glucose monitoring has long felt like a future promise that never quite arrives. The attention around isaac at CES 2026 suggests that promise may finally be getting closer. If clinical trials continue to deliver strong results and regulators give approval, breathing into a small device could one day replace at least some finger pricks.

      "Every January, I hear from people who say the same thing: \"I just got an email that looked official, and I almost fell for it.\" That's not a coincidence. January is one of the busiest months of the year for scammers. While most of us are focused on taxes, benefits, subscriptions, and getting our finances in order, criminals are doing their own kind of cleanup, refreshing scam lists and going after people with newly updated personal data.

      "Scam messages often look urgent and official, pushing you to act before you have time to think. That pressure is exactly what criminals rely on. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why January is prime time for scammers",
      "January is when scammers have everything they need.\u00a0According to YouMail's Robocall Index, U.S. consumers received just over 4.7 billion robocalls in January 2025, a roughly 9% increase from December 2024. This year, we can expect the same pattern from scammers.",

      "People are dealing with taxes and government accounts",
      "Benefits and subscriptions reset or renew",
      "Financial stress is higher after the holidays",
      "But the biggest reason scams spike now? Your personal data is easier to find than you think. Data brokers quietly collect and update profiles year after year. By January, those profiles are often more complete than ever, and scammers know it.",
      "The \"account verification\" scam you'll see everywhere",
      "One of the most common January scams looks harmless at first. You get a message saying:",
      "\"Your Social Security account needs verification\"\"Your Medicare information has to be updated\"\"Your benefits could be delayed without action\"",
      "\"Your Social Security account needs verification\"",
      "\"Your Medicare information has to be updated\"",
      "\"Your benefits could be delayed without action\"",
      "The message sounds official. Sometimes it even uses your real name or location. That's where people get tricked. Government agencies don't ask for sensitive information through random emails or texts. Scammers rely on urgency and familiarity to push you into reacting before thinking.",
      "My rule: If you didn't initiate the request, don't respond to it. Always go directly to the agency's official website or phone number, never through a link sent to you.",

      "Emails claiming you owe back taxes",

      "Notices asking you to \"confirm\" banking information.",
      "These scams work because they arrive at exactly the moment people expect to hear from tax agencies or benefits programs.",
      "Scammers don't need much to sound convincing. A name, an email address or an old address is often enough. If you get a tax-related message out of the blue, slow down. Real agencies don't pressure you to act immediately.",

      "The more personal data scammers have, the more convincing their messages become. Removing your information from data broker sites can help reduce targeted scams over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you should do right now",
      "Before January gets any busier, take these steps to reduce your exposure to scams and fraud:",
      "Deleting emails or blocking numbers helps, but it does not stop scams at the source. Scammers rely on data broker sites that quietly collect, update and sell your personal information. Removing your data from those sites reduces scam calls, phishing emails and targeted texts over time. It also makes it harder for criminals to personalize messages using your real name, address or family connections. You have two ways to do this:",
      "Do it yourself:",
      "You can visit individual data broker websites, search for your profile and submit opt-out requests.This method works, but it takes time. Each site has its own rules, identity verification steps, and response timelines. Many brokers also re-add data later, which means you have to repeat the process regularly.",
      "Use a data removal service:",
      "A data removal service automates the opt-out process by contacting hundreds of data brokers on your behalf and monitoring for re-listings. This option saves time and provides ongoing protection, especially if you want long-term results without constant follow-ups.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you did not initiate the request, do not click. Scam messages are designed to create urgency, especially around taxes, benefits and account issues. Instead, go directly to the official website by typing the address yourself or using a saved bookmark. This single habit prevents most phishing attacks.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a critical second layer of protection. Even if someone gets your password, they still cannot access your account without the second verification code. Start with email, financial accounts, social media and government services.",
      "If you receive a warning about an account problem, do not trust the message itself. Open the official app or website, and check there. If something is wrong, you will see it immediately. If not, you just avoided a scam.",
      "Enable login alerts and security notifications on important accounts. These alerts can warn you if someone tries to sign in from a new device or location. Early warnings give you time to act before real damage occurs.",
      "Reusing passwords makes it easy for scammers to take over multiple accounts at once. If one service is compromised, attackers try the same login on email, banking, and social media accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account without needing to remember them.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "January scams aren't random. They're targeted, timed and fueled by personal data that shouldn't be public in the first place. The longer your information stays online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. If you want a quieter inbox, fewer scam calls and less risk this year, take action early, before criminals finish rebuilding their lists. Protect your data now, and you'll be safer all year long.",

      "Kodiak AI, a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous driving technology, has spent years quietly proving that self-driving trucks can work in the real world. The company's core system, the Kodiak Driver, brings software and hardware together in a practical way. As the company explains, \"The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-driven software with modular, vehicle-agnostic hardware into a single, unified platform.\"",
      "That approach matters because trucking is not a closed lab environment. It is highways, weather, fatigue and long hours. Kodiak's strategy focuses on solving those realities first.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How public views on autonomous trucks are changing",
      "During a recent episode of CyberGuy's \"Beyond Connected\" podcast, Kurt spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "Autonomous trucks are already hauling freight on public highways as companies test how the technology performs in real-world conditions. (Kodiak)",
      "Goff described how different the reaction was when the company first launched. \"Kodiak was founded in 2018, and I joined in 2019. When I first started at the company, I said I worked for a company that was working to build trucks that drive themselves, and people kind of looked at me like I was crazy. Over the last few years, we've really seen autonomous vehicles capture the public's imagination. We've seen them grow in the real world. I think that people are getting more used to this idea.\"",
      "For Goff, that shift has come from seeing the technology operate safely outside of test environments, where performance matters more than hype.",
      "Why autonomous trucks could improve road safety",
      "One of Kodiak AI's central arguments is simple. Machines avoid many of the risks that come with human driving. \"We think there are advantages to this technology that humans, myself included, can't match. You know this technology doesn't get distracted. It doesn't check its phone. It doesn't have a phone. It doesn't have a bad day to take it out on the road. It doesn't speed. It doesn't know how to speed. You know they're pretty boring drivers.\" In trucking, boring is often a good thing.",
      "Where autonomous trucks are already operating today",
      "Kodiak AI is already doing this on real roads. The company has been running active freight routes for years, not just testing in controlled settings. \"Kodiak's headquarters are in Mountainview, California, but since 2019, we've had a command center in Lancaster, Texas, which is just south of Dallas. Since 2019, we've actually been delivering freight from that Lancaster hub to Houston, Oklahoma City and Atlanta with what we call a safety driver behind the wheel.\"",
      "Those real-world miles have helped Kodiak fine-tune its system in everyday traffic, weather and long-haul conditions.",
      "Tractor trailers at the entrance of the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 8, 2024. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)",
      "The trucking problem Kodiak is trying to solve",
      "Long-haul trucking is essential to the U.S. economy, but it is also one of the most demanding and risky jobs on the road. Drivers spend long stretches away from home, work extended hours and operate heavy vehicles in all conditions. As Goff put it, \"Driving a truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs that people do in the United States every day. You know, being a truck driver means, for at least a long-haul truck driver, means you're away from your family for sometimes days, weeks, even months at a time, sleeping in the back of the truck.\"",
      "He also pointed to federal safety rules that limit how long drivers can stay behind the wheel, which are meant to reduce fatigue but also restrict how much freight one person can move in a day. \"If you're driving the 11-hour legal maximum per day and there are people who love being long-haul truckers, but we\u2019re not seeing people stepping up for those roles anymore in this country, and drivers are retiring every year.\"",
      "Those realities have contributed to ongoing driver shortages and growing pressure on the freight system. Kodiak believes autonomous technology is best used where the job is hardest and most repetitive. \"The goal for this technology is really best suited for those really tough jobs. The long lonely highway miles, the trucking and remote locations where people either don't wanna live or don't or can't easily live.\"",
      "Goff also highlighted how much capacity is lost simply because trucks sit idle for most of the day. \"The average truck is driven about seven hours a day in the U.S., and you know there are 24 hours a day, so that's a lot of time just sitting there.\"",
      "Autonomy, he said, could help change that math. \"The goal of the technology is that you can basically run 24/7, just kind of stopping to refuel, to inspect the truck for safety, and you know, other than that, the trucks are moving.\"",
      "Long-haul trucking is one of the most demanding jobs on the road, which is why autonomous systems focus on long, repetitive highway routes. (Kodiak)",
      "How many miles Kodiak AI has driven to prove safety",
      "Kodiak AI emphasizes data over promises. \"We've driven over 3 million miles with a safety driver behind the wheel for most of those miles, meaning somebody ready to take over at any time. So, we got a very good track record.\" To put that into perspective, Goff added, \"The average American drives about 800,000 miles in their lifetime, which seems crazy. That's a lot of driving, but we're at almost four average lifetimes with our system today, and we also use computer simulation, all sorts of things to assess the safety of the system.\"",
      "In addition to its long-haul operations, Kodiak AI works with Atlas Energy Solutions, which does oil logistics in the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. As of Q3 2025, the company has delivered 10 driverless trucks to Atlas, which autonomously deliver sand up to 24 hours a day with no human operator in the cab. Goff says, \"We see our work in the Permian as a perfect sandbox for our long-haul operations.\"",
      "The company has also sought third-party validation. \"Additionally, we have done external-facing studies. We did a study with a company called Nauto, which is one of the leaders in AI-enabled dashcams. They actually help vehicle fleets compute safety scores from an outside perspective. Our system scored the highest ever in the Nauto safety score.\"",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Where autonomous truck regulations stand today",
      "Policy is another key factor in adoption. \"From a regulatory perspective. 25 states have passed laws allowing autonomous vehicle deployment.\" Goff believes the danger of everyday driving makes the case clear. \"I think people who think about transportation every day understand how dangerous driving a car is, driving a truck is, and just being on the road see the potential for this technology.\"",
      "What critics say about autonomous trucks",
      "Autonomous trucking still raises concerns among safety advocates and everyday drivers. Critics question whether software can respond fast enough in emergencies, handle unpredictable human behavior or make judgment calls during complex highway situations.",
      "Kodiak AI says those concerns are exactly why safety comes first. As Goff explained, \"In this industry in particular, we really understand how important it is to be safe.\"",
      "The company argues that autonomous systems must earn trust over time through real-world performance, transparent testing and measurable results, not promises or hype.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday drivers, autonomous trucks raise understandable questions. Sharing the road with a vehicle controlled by software can feel unsettling, especially when headlines often focus on what could go wrong. Kodiak's argument is that safety improves when fatigue, distraction and emotional decision-making are removed from long highway driving. If the technology continues to perform as claimed, the impact could show up in quieter ways. That includes fewer tired drivers on overnight routes, more predictable freight movement and potentially safer highways over time. For consumers, it could also mean fewer delivery delays and less strain on a trucking system already short on drivers.",

At the same time, skepticism remains healthy and necessary. Trust in this technology will rise or fall based on transparency, regulation and long-term performance, not promises.

      "FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM ARE USING YOUR DATA TO TRAIN AI: LEARN HOW TO PROTECT IT",
      "Unexpected Instagram password reset emails can look completely legitimate, which is why so many users are caught off guard during this surge. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "Why Instagram password reset emails are surging",
      "This surge is happening because the reset emails themselves can be real, even when the intent behind them is not. Instead of building fake phishing pages or using malware, attackers take advantage of Instagram's normal account recovery system.",
      "The process is simple. An attacker enters your username or email into Instagram's real password reset form. Instagram automatically sends a legitimate reset email to you. The attacker then waits to see how you react.",
      "At this point, your account has not been hacked. The risk comes from what happens next. Attackers are counting on common mistakes, such as clicking the reset button and rushing through the process, reusing a weak password, getting redirected to a fake follow-up page or falling for a second scam email that arrives soon after.",
      "That is why this tactic works as a stress test. It creates urgency and pressure, even though nothing has been compromised yet.",
      "Why attackers love this tactic",
      "This is classic social engineering. The attacker does not need to outsmart Instagram. They need to outsmart you in a stressed moment. A reset email creates urgency. It also feels official. That combination leads people to click first and think second, which is exactly the outcome attackers want. You can treat these surprise reset emails as an early warning system. If you get one:",

      "Your current security setup will decide whether this stays annoying or turns into a takeover",
      "If an email pressures you to act immediately, threatens account deletion or asks for extra information, treat it as suspicious.",
      "The BreachForums leak connection",
      "The timing of this surge has raised fresh concerns. Reports point to data tied to roughly 17.5 million Instagram accounts being shared on BreachForums, an underground forum where cybercriminals trade and discuss stolen data. The alleged post appeared in early January 2026, which lines up with when many users began reporting a sudden wave of password reset emails, sometimes receiving several in a short period of time.",
      "This timing alone does not prove a direct connection. However, leaked usernames or email addresses can make it much easier for attackers to target large numbers of accounts at once, which is exactly what this kind of reset spam depends on. We reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "We reached out to Meta for comment, and a spokesperson for the company told CyberGuy, \"We fixed an issue that allowed an external party to request password reset emails for some Instagram users. We want to reassure everyone there was no breach of our systems and people's Instagram accounts remain secure. People can disregard these emails and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\"",
      "How to tell if the reset email is legitimate",
      "A legitimate Instagram reset email can still be part of an attack attempt. So your goal is not \"confirm it is real,\" it is \"avoid reacting in a risky way.\" Instagram's own guidance boils down to this:",

      "Also, if you get emails about changing your account email address, Instagram says those messages can include a way to reverse the change, which can help you recover if someone broke in.",

      "What scammers rely on",

      "What to do right now if you get a reset email you did not request",
      "So, what should you do if one of these password reset emails lands in your inbox? Take a breath first. Then do this.",
      "Even if the message looks real, treat it like a hot surface. If you want to change your password, do it from the Instagram app or by typing Instagram's address into your browser yourself. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection here. It can help block malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up scams that often appear during a reset email surge.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0is the biggest roadblock for account takeover. Even if someone knows your password, they still need your code to get in from an unfamiliar device. Instagram has pushed 2FA heavily for higher-risk accounts and urges users to enable it. Use an authenticator app if you can. It is often safer than SMS.",
      "If you suspect someone guessed your password, or you reused it elsewhere, change it. Make it long and unique. A password manager can help you generate and store strong passwords without reusing them. Then update the password on your email account too. Your email inbox controls most password resets, so make sure it also uses a strong, unique password.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password reset surges often follow data leaks. When your email address and personal details appear on data broker sites, attackers can target you more easily. A data removal service helps limit where your information shows up online. By shrinking your digital footprint, you reduce the chances of being singled out during large-scale reset email attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Slow down and verify everything inside the app.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A spike in Instagram password reset emails feels scary because it looks like someone is already inside your account. Often, they are not. Still, the surge is a reminder to tighten your basics. Use the app to check security. Turn on two-factor authentication. Change the passwords you reused. Most importantly, do not let an unexpected email rush you into the one click that hands over access.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "If you are tired of scam calls slipping through the cracks, federal regulators just took a meaningful step. The Federal Communications Commission finalized new penalties aimed at telecom companies that submit false, inaccurate or late information to a key anti-robocall system. The changes go into effect Feb. 5. They strengthen oversight of the Robocall Mitigation Database, which plays a central role in tracking spoofed calls and holding providers accountable.",

      "What changed and why it matters",
      "Under the new rules, voice service providers must recertify every year that their filings in the Robocall Mitigation Database are accurate and current. The FCC will now back that requirement with real financial consequences.",
      "The FCC is cracking down on robocalls by tightening rules that govern how telecom providers verify and report call traffic. (iStock)",
      "FCC SCRUBS OWN REFERENCE TO 'INDEPENDENT' AGENCY FROM WEBSITE AFTER DEM'S TESTY EXCHANGE WITH CHAIRMAN",
      "Here is what the commission approved:",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business daysAnnual recertification of all provider filingsThe FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.Two-factor authentication to protect database accessA $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",

      "The FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.",
      "Two-factor authentication to protect database access",
      "A $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "The FCC also made clear that these violations are considered ongoing until corrected, meaning fines can accrue on a daily basis rather than being treated as one-time penalties.",
      "According to the FCC, many past submissions failed basic standards. Some lacked accurate contact details. Others included robocall mitigation plans that did not describe any real mitigation practices at all.",
      "How the Robocall Mitigation Database works",
      "The Robocall Mitigation Database requires providers to verify and certify the identities of callers that use their networks. Regulators and law enforcement rely on it to trace spoofed calls and illegal robocall campaigns. That task is harder than it sounds. America's telecom system is vast and fragmented. Calls often pass through multiple networks owned by major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller regional providers and VoIP services. When calls hop between networks, verification can be missed or ignored. For years, the FCC did not closely verify or enforce the accuracy of these filings. That gap raised serious concerns.",
      "Under the updated rules, providers that fail to recertify or correct deficient filings can be referred to enforcement and removed from the database, which can prevent other carriers from carrying their calls at all.",
      "Why inaccurate robocall data hurts consumers",
      "When robocall filings are wrong or outdated, scam calls are more likely to reach your phone. Providers may treat a call as trusted even when it should raise red flags. That gives robocallers more time to operate and makes it harder for regulators to shut them down quickly. The FCC says stronger penalties and tighter oversight are meant to close that gap before consumers pay the price.",
      "New FCC penalties target inaccurate robocall filings that have allowed scam calls to slip through carrier networks.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Pushback and pressure on the FCC",
      "When the FCC proposed penalties, it asked whether violations should be treated as minor paperwork mistakes or as serious misrepresentations. Telecom trade groups pushed back. They argued that fines should not apply unless providers first get a chance to fix errors or unless the FCC proves the filings were willfully inaccurate.",
      "State attorneys general and the robocall monitoring platform ZipDX urged a tougher stance. They warned that false filings undermine every effort to stop illegal robocalls. The FCC ultimately chose a middle path. It rejected treating violations as harmless paperwork errors. At the same time, it stopped short of imposing the maximum penalties allowed by law.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday consumers, this move matters more than it may seem. Accurate robocall reporting makes it easier to trace scam calls, shut down bad actors and prevent spoofed numbers from reaching your phone. Stronger penalties give telecoms a reason to take these filings seriously instead of treating them as routine compliance chores.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "The FCC also set a firm annual deadline. Providers must recertify their robocall mitigation filings each year by March 1, creating a predictable enforcement checkpoint. While this will not end robocalls overnight, it tightens a weak link that scammers have exploited for years.",
      "Simple steps you can take right now to reduce robocalls",
      "Even with tougher FCC enforcement, scam calls will not disappear overnight. Here are a few smart steps you can take today to reduce your risk.",
      "Do not answer unknown calls. If it is important, a legitimate caller will leave a voicemail.Never press buttons or say yes to robocall prompts. That confirms your number is active and can trigger more scam calls.Report scam calls to your carrier. Most major carriers let you report robocalls directly through their call log or app.Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov/. It will not stop scammers, but it can reduce legitimate telemarketing calls.Block repeat offenders.

      "Pro tip: remove your personal data at the source",
      "Robocalls do not come out of nowhere. Many start with your personal information being sold or shared by data brokers. These companies collect phone numbers, addresses, emails and even family details from public records, apps, purchases and online activity. Scammers and shady marketers buy that data to build call lists. Removing your data from data broker sites can reduce the number of robocalls you receive over time. You can try to do this manually by finding individual data broker websites and submitting removal requests one by one. The process is time-consuming and often needs to be repeated.",
      "Some people choose to use a data removal service to automate this process and continuously monitor for re-posting. That can help limit how often your phone number circulates among marketers and scammers. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for robocallers to target you.

      "Robocalls thrive when accountability breaks down. By adding meaningful fines, stronger security, annual recertification and filing fees, the FCC is signaling that accuracy is no longer optional. Because penalties can continue to build until problems are fixed, telecoms now face real consequences for ignoring or delaying corrections. This rule forces providers to own their role in stopping illegal calls instead of passing the blame along the network chain. Real progress will depend on enforcement, but this is one of the clearest signs yet that regulators are closing gaps scammers rely on.",

      "That sense of security is exactly what attackers like to exploit. Security researchers have now uncovered a fresh wave of malicious Mac extensions that don't just spy on you, but can also steal cryptocurrency wallet data, passwords and even Keychain credentials. What makes this campaign especially concerning is where the malware was found, inside legitimate extension marketplaces that many people trust by default.",

      "How malicious Mac extensions slipped into trusted stores",
      "Security researchers at Koi Security uncovered a new wave of the GlassWorm malware hiding inside extensions for code editors like Visual Studio Code (via Bleeping Computer). If you're not familiar with code editors, they're tools developers use to write and edit code, similar to how you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit text. These malicious extensions appeared on both the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace and OpenVSX, platforms widely used by developers and power users.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "At first glance, the extensions looked harmless. They promised popular features like code formatting, themes or productivity tools. Once installed, though, they quietly ran malicious code in the background. Earlier versions of GlassWorm relied on hidden text tricks to stay invisible. The latest wave goes further by encrypting its malicious code and delaying execution, making it harder for automated security checks to catch.",
      "Even though this campaign is described as targeting developers, you don't need to write code to be at risk. If you use a Mac, install extensions or store passwords or cryptocurrency on your system, this threat still applies to you.",
      "What GlassWorm does once it's on your Mac",
      "Once active, GlassWorm goes after some of the most sensitive data on your device. It attempts to steal login credentials tied to platforms like GitHub and npm, but it doesn't stop there. The malware also targets browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and now tries to access your macOS Keychain, where many saved passwords are stored.",
      "Researchers also found that GlassWorm checks whether hardware wallet apps like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite are installed. If they are, the malware attempts to replace them with a compromised version designed to steal crypto. That part of the attack isn't fully working yet, but the functionality is already in place.",
      "To maintain access, the malware sets itself up to run automatically after a reboot. It can also allow remote access to your system and route internet traffic through your Mac without you realizing it, turning your device into a quiet relay for someone else.",
      "Some of the malicious extensions showed tens of thousands of downloads. Those numbers can be manipulated, but they still create a false sense of trust that makes people more likely to install them.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from malicious Mac extensions",
      "Malicious extensions don't look dangerous. That's what makes them effective. These steps can help you reduce the risk, even when threats slip into trusted marketplaces.",

This adds a critical safety net when something slips through official marketplaces.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: Fox News' Nate Foy and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla.,\u00a0 discuss a surge in teenage suicides related to online 'sextortion', identify the terror groups culpable and share advice for parents to keep their children safe.",
      "At first glance, the job posts look completely harmless. They promise fast money, flexible hours and paid training. No experience required. Payment comes in crypto. But these are not tutoring gigs or customer service roles. They are recruiting ads for ransomware operations.",
      "And many of the people responding are middle and high school students. Some posts openly say they prefer inexperienced workers. Others quietly prioritize young women. All of them promise big payouts for \"successful calls.\"",
      "What they leave out is the risk. Federal charges. Prison time. Permanent records. This underground ecosystem goes by a familiar name. Insiders often refer to it as \"The Com,\" short for \"The Community.\"",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Fake job ads promising fast cash and flexible hours are quietly recruiting teens into ransomware and extortion schemes, often paying in cryptocurrency to hide criminal activity. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How The Com operates behind the scenes",
      "The Com is not a single organized gang. It functions as a loose network of groups that regularly change names and members. Well-known offshoots tied to this ecosystem include Scattered Spider, Lapsus$,\u00a0ShinyHunters and related splinter crews. Some groups focus on data theft. Others specialize in\u00a0phishing or\u00a0extortion. Collaboration happens when it benefits the operation.",
      "Since 2022, these networks have targeted more than 100 major companies in the U.S. and UK. Victims include well-known brands across retail, telecom, finance, fashion and media, including companies such as T-Mobile, Nike and Instacart. The combined market value of affected companies exceeds one trillion dollars.",
      "Teenagers often take on the riskiest roles within these schemes. Phone calls, access testing and social engineering scripts typically fall to younger participants. More experienced criminals remain in the background, limiting their exposure.",
      "That structure mirrors what identity and fraud experts are seeing across the industry. Ricardo Amper, founder and CEO of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, says fake job ads are effective because they borrow trust from a familiar social contract.",
      "\"A job post feels structured, normal and safe, even when the actual behavior being requested is anything but,\" Amper said.\u00a0\"A job posting implies a real process - a role, a manager, training and a paycheck. That's exactly why it works. It lowers skepticism and makes risky requests feel like normal onboarding.\"",
      "Amper notes that what's changed is not just the scale of recruitment, but how criminals package it.\u00a0\"Serious crime is now being sold as 'work.'\"",
      "Why teens excel at social engineering attacks",
      "Teenagers bring a unique mix of skills that make them highly convincing. Fluent English and comfort with modern workplace technology help them sound legitimate. Familiarity with tools like Slack, ticketing systems and cloud platforms makes impersonation easier.",
      "According to Amper, teens don't need technical expertise to get pulled in.\u00a0\"The on-ramp is usually social, a Discord server, a DM, a 'quick gig,'\" he said.\u00a0\"It can feel like trolling culture, but the targets are real companies and the consequences are real people.\"",
      "Risk awareness is often lower. Conversations frequently take place in public chats, where tactics and mistakes are shared quickly. That visibility accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of detection and arrest.",
      "Gaming culture feeds the pipeline",
      "For many teens, it starts small. Pranks in online games turn into account takeovers. Username theft becomes crypto theft. Skills escalate. So do the stakes.",
      "Recruitment often begins in gaming spaces where fast learning and confidence are rewarded. Grooming is common. Sextortion sometimes appears. By the time real money enters the picture, legal consequences feel distant.",
      "Amper compares the progression to gaming itself.\u00a0\"These crews package crime as a ladder,\" he said.\u00a0\"Join the group, do small tasks, level up, get paid, get status.\"",
      "Why young women are being targeted",
      "Cybercrime remains male-dominated, but recruiters adapt. Young women are increasingly recruited for phone-based attacks. Some use AI tools to alter accents or tone. Others rely on stereotypes. Distress lowers suspicion faster than authority. Researchers say women often succeed because they are underestimated. That same dynamic puts them at risk inside these groups. Leadership remains overwhelmingly male. Girls often perform low-level work. Training stays minimal. Exploitation is frequent.",
      "Red flags that signal fake job scams and ransomware recruitment",
      "These warning signs show up repeatedly in cases involving teen hackers, social engineering crews and ransomware groups.",
      "Legitimate employers do not pay workers exclusively in cryptocurrency. Crypto-only pay makes transactions hard to trace and protects criminals, not workers.",
      "Promises of hundreds of dollars for a single call or quick task often point to illegal activity. Real jobs pay hourly or a salary with documentation.",
      "Criminal groups rely on private messaging apps to avoid oversight. Established companies do not recruit employees through gaming chats or encrypted DMs.",
      "Being \"trained from scratch\" by unnamed individuals is common in ransomware pipelines. These mentors disappear when arrests happen.",
      "Any job that asks teens to hide work from parents or employees to hide tasks from employers is crossing a line. Secrecy protects the recruiter, not the recruit.",
      "Amper offers a simple rule of thumb:\u00a0\"If a 'job' asks you to pretend to be someone else, obtain access, move money, or share sensitive identifiers before you've verified the employer, you're not in a hiring process. You're in a crime pipeline.\"",
      "He adds that legitimate employers collect sensitive information only after a real offer, through verified HR systems.\u00a0\"The scam version flips the order,\" he said.\u00a0\"It asks for the most sensitive details first, before anything is independently verifiable.\"",
      "Rushing decisions or creating fear lowers judgment. Social engineering depends on speed and emotional reactions.",
      "If you see more than one of these signs, pause immediately. Walking away early can prevent serious legal consequences later.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Cybercrime recruiters are targeting middle and high school students for risky roles like social engineering calls, exposing them to federal charges and prison time. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Law enforcement is cracking down on teen cybercrime",
      "Since 2024, government indictments and international arrests have shown cybercriminal groups tied to The Com and Scattered Spider are under increasing scrutiny from law enforcement. In Sept. 2025, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a Department of Justice complaint\u00a0against 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, accusing him of orchestrating at least 120 ransomware and extortion attacks that brought in over $115 million in ransom payments from 47 U.S. companies and organizations, including federal court networks. Prosecutors charged Jubair with computer fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.",
      "Across the Atlantic, British authorities charged Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers for their alleged roles in a Transport for London cyberattack in 2024 that compromised travel card data and disrupted live commuter information. Both appeared in court under the U.K.'s Computer Misuse Act. Earlier law enforcement action in the U.S. included criminal charges against five Scattered Spider suspects for mass phishing campaigns that stole login credentials and millions in cryptocurrency, laying out how members of this collective staged coordinated extortion and data theft.",
      "Federal agencies are also issuing advisories about the group's social engineering techniques, noting how attackers impersonate help desks, abuse multi-factor authentication and harvest credentials to access corporate networks.",
      "Parents often learn the truth late. In many cases, the first warning comes when federal agents arrive at the door. Teens can move from online pranks to serious federal crimes without realizing where the legal line lies.",
      "How parents and teens can avoid ransomware recruitment traps",
      "This type of cybercrime thrives on silence and speed. Slowing things down protects families and futures.",
      "Parents play a critical role in spotting early warning signs, especially when online \"work\" starts happening behind closed doors or moves too fast to explain.",
      "1) Pay attention to how online \"jobs\" are communicated",
      "Ask which platforms your child uses for work conversations and who they talk to. Legitimate employers do not recruit through Telegram or Discord DMs.",
      "2) Question sudden income with no clear employer",
      "Money appearing quickly, especially in crypto, deserves scrutiny. Real jobs provide paperwork, supervisors and pay records.",
      "3) Treat secrecy as a serious warning sign",
      "If a teen is told to keep work private from parents or teachers, that is not independence. It is manipulation.",
      "4) Talk early about legal consequences online",
      "Many teens do not realize that cybercrime can lead to federal charges. Honest conversations now prevent life-changing outcomes later. Also, monitoring may feel uncomfortable. However, silence creates more risk.",
      "Teenagers with tech skills have real opportunities ahead, but knowing how to spot fake offers can mean the difference between building a career and facing serious legal trouble.",
      "1) Be skeptical of private messages offering fast money",
      "Real companies do not cold-recruit through private chats or gaming servers.",
      "2) Avoid crypto-only payment offers",
      "Being paid only in cryptocurrency is a common tactic used to hide criminal activity.",
      "3) Choose legal paths to build skills and reputation",
      "Bug bounty programs, cybersecurity clubs and internships offer real experience without risking your future. Talent opens doors. Prison closes them.",

      "What makes this trend so unsettling is how ordinary it all looks. The job ads sound harmless. The chats feel friendly. The crypto payouts seem exciting. But underneath that surface is a pipeline pulling teenagers into serious crimes with real consequences. Many kids do not realize how far they have gone until it is too late. What starts as a quick call or a side hustle can turn into federal charges and years of fallout. Cybercrime moves fast. Accountability usually shows up much later.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "Touch something hot, and your hand snaps back before you even think. That split second matters.",
      "Sensory nerves in your skin send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors. Even tiny delays can lead to broken parts or dangerous interactions.",
      "As robots move into homes, hospitals and workplaces, that lag becomes a real problem.",
      "A robotic skin designed to mimic the human nervous system",
      "Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.",

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",

      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

And to be fair, they look irresistible on paper, offering thousands of channels for a one-time payment. But security researchers are warning that some of these boxes may come with a hidden cost.",

      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your router supports it, isolate smart TVs and streaming boxes from your main network. This prevents a compromised device from seeing your laptops, phones or work systems. It's one of the simplest ways to limit damage if something goes wrong.",
      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

      "If you notice suspicious traffic or behavior, unplug the streaming box immediately and perform a factory reset on your router. In some cases, the safest option is to stop using the device altogether.",
      "Also, make sure your router firmware is up to date and that you've changed the default admin password. Compromised devices often try to exploit weak router settings to persist on a network.",
      "Unlimited premium channels for a one-time fee usually mean you're paying in some other way, often with your data, bandwidth or legal exposure. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is.",
      "If your internet connection or accounts have been abused, your personal details may already be circulating among data brokers. A data removal service can help opt you out of people-search sites and reduce the amount of personal information criminals can exploit for follow-up scams or identity theft.

      "Streaming boxes like SuperBox thrive on frustration. As subscriptions pile up, people look for shortcuts. But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection.

      "FIRST ON FOX: Multiple documents released by Argentine President Javier Milei last year reveal how Argentina\u2019s search for Nazi war criminals, who found refuge in the country during and after the Second World War, were able to avoid arrest and, for the most part, live ordinary lives.",
      "While Argentina\u2019s Peronist government sympathized and often knew of Nazi criminals hiding in their territory \u2013 often under their auspices \u2013 once the populist regime fell, the South American nation half-heartedly tried to keep tabs on the war criminals hiding there.",
      "Though many high-profile cases went nowhere, the case of Hitler\u2019s henchman Martin Bormann is exemplary in showing how inefficient Argentina was in its investigations.",

      "Hitler with Martin Bormann, right, and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in August 1943. (Ullstein Bild/Ullstein Bild via Getty Images)",
      "Bormann was one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi regime, despite his relatively low profile to the public. He used his position as private secretary to Hitler and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery to control the flow of documents personally received by Hitler and who had access to him.",
      "Through enormous administrative influence, he shaped policy and controlled what Hitler saw, who he met, and advised on major decisions. Bormann supported extreme antisemitic measures and was one of the masterminds of the Aryanization project. Bormann disappeared in May 1945 during the fall of Berlin. For decades, it was speculated he had fled to Argentina along the ratlines \u2014 escape routes facilitated by Nazi sympathizers. Bormann was sentenced to death in absentia during the Nuremberg Trials.",
      "The files show that Bormann was one of the very few Nazis the Argentinians actively tried to pursue and bring to justice. However, most of the leads came from sensationalist press articles often devoid of factual and actionable intelligence beyond the mere mention that he was hiding in Argentina.",
      "The files meticulously depict intelligence agencies trying to corroborate such reports and assert whether the floated false aliases matched the actual man in Argentina. Agencies followed information coming from reports in the Argentine, U.S., British and Brazilian press, along with some translations from German-language media published in Argentina by the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community who were suspected of harboring Nazi sympathizers.",
      "The articles triggered extensive paper trails between the ministry of justice, intelligence bodies, border and customs agencies, the federal police, and local authorities, but were often disconnected from one another, or took a long time to be referred to the various sub-offices for action.",

      "As a result, multiple similar searches were carried out at various points haphazardly and a tangle of bureaucracy made authorities play catch up to press reports rather than conduct independent and rational investigations. The files are a testament that the hunt for Nazis in South America was shaped by rumor, miscommunication, mistaken identities, Cold War politics and intense media speculation.",
      "Some of the information reviewed by Fox News Digital showed authorities took rumors such as a hunt for Bormann in the jungles of Peru, Colombia and Brazil as credible. A case of an elderly German man detained in Colombia in 1972 as Bormann (later cleared and released) despite voiced skepticism by Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal is also part of the files.",
      "Partial Memo from the ministry of interior about Walter Flegel's criminal record as requested by authorities who were looking into the whereabouts of Martin Bormann. (General Archives of the Government of Argentina)",
      "The diplomatic shockwaves that followed Israel\u2019s Mossad seizing Adolf Eichmann in Argentina left local officials acutely sensitive to international scrutiny, recasting the search for Bormann as a bid to ensure the country would not be embarrassed on the world stage a second time.",
      "A pivotal\u2014and ultimately flawed\u2014lead in the Bormann files emerged in 1955, when police, relying on fading testimonies about an illegal German laborer, along with rumors, seized correspondence and aging witnesses, began pursuing a man named Walter Wilhelm Flegel.",
      "Mug shot of Walter Wilhelm Flegel. (General Archives of the Government of Argentina)",
      "Flegel had arrived through Chile, was missing an arm due to an accident, and had been previously arrested and brought to court twice on assault and robbery charges. Suspicions led to his arrest in Mendoza in 1960 despite his complete dissemblance, lack of education, long presence in the country, age gaps and missing factual connections that could tie him to Bormann. Notwithstanding such mismatching profiles \u2014 and fingerprints \u2014 it still took a week for Argentinians to be convinced Flegel was not Bormann and free him.",

      "Ultimately, despite continued rumors, and Argentina\u2019s singular resolve in finally arresting one of the many Nazi fugitives thought to be in the country, human remains found in Berlin in 1972 were a match and confirmed Bormann\u2019s death during the city\u2019s fall through dental and cranial records. Later, in the 1990s, further DNA testing confirmed the remains found in Berlin indeed belonged to Bormann, bringing the misdirected Argentinian search finally to a close.",

      "Asked whether the dispute reflects American pressure or European inaction, Whitaker said, \"This is ultimately an issue between the United States, Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "Whitaker said Greenland\u2019s importance has been clear for years as the ice melts, it reshapes the Arctic and opens new routes. \"The security of the high north, which I\u2019ve talked about a lot before this ever happened, is the most important issue,\" he said. \"As the ice thaws and as routes open up in the Arctic, Arctic security, and therefore the security of Greenland, which is the northern flank of the continental United States, is crucial.\"",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration formally launched the second phase of its plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas this week, shifting from a ceasefire framework toward a post-ceasefire political and security phase for Gaza. The announcement immediately raised a central question that now dominates expert analysis: who will actually disarm Hamas.",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff announced Wednesday that phase two is underway, describing it as a transition \"from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance and reconstruction.\" He warned that Hamas must fully comply with its obligations under the deal, including the immediate return of the final deceased Israeli hostage.",
      "\"The U.S. expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage,\" Witkoff wrote on X. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"",

Trump said that since the ceasefire, his team had helped deliver \"RECORD LEVELS of Humanitarian Aid to Gaza, reaching Civilians at HISTORIC speed and scale,\" adding that \"even the United Nations has acknowledged this achievement as UNPRECEDENTED.\"",
      "Trump wrote that these developments had \"set the stage for this next phase,\" which he said would include backing a newly appointed Palestinian technocratic government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, to govern the territory during a transitional period. Trump described himself as chairman of the Board of Peace and said the committee would be supported by the board\u2019s high representative.",

      "\"As long as Hamas can interrupt aid distribution, intimidate and kill Gazans who want a better future, and threaten renewed war with Israel, international investment in reconstruction and reform will be near zero,\" he said.",

      "Ruhe noted that a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizes an International Stabilization Force to disarm Hamas, but he said no country has been willing to put troops in that role. Instead, he said the Trump plan outlines a more limited mission for international forces, focused on guarding aid sites and preventing Hamas resupply.",
      "\"Trump and Netanyahu both said Israel might have to disarm Hamas,\" Ruhe said. \"But the IDF ground forces need to rest and refit after two years of grueling combat, and a major offensive risks blowing up the international coalition needed for phase two.\"",

    "summary": "Federal officials are investigating the partner of Renee Nicole Good to determine whether she may have impeded a federal officer moments before he shot and killed Good in Minneapolis, sources say",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal officials are investigating the partner of Renee Nicole Good to determine whether she may have impeded a federal officer moments before he shot and killed Good in Minneapolis, according to two people familiar with the investigation who spoke to NBC News.",
      "The federal investigation into the shooting by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross is focusing more on Becca Good, including what officials said were her possible ties to activist groups, and less on Ross\u2019 actions when he fired into Renee Good\u2019s vehicle during an immigration operation last week, the people said.",
      "The fatal encounter has touched off protests in Minneapolis and calls for accountability for immigration officers, whose tactics have resulted in at least 10 other shootings since September.",
      "Antonio Romanucci, Becca Good\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement Saturday that \u201cthere has been no contact from the FBI or federal officials indicating Becca Good is the subject of an investigation.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department is also investigating Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey under the theory they conspired to impede federal immigration agents through their public statements, according to a senior law enforcement official and person familiar with the matter.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The Democratic officials have criticized ICE\u2019s enforcement tactics and said in statements the investigation was obviously political. Frey said he would not be intimidated.",
      "\u201cThe only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,\u201d Walz said.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a message seeking comment on Good and declined to comment on Walz and Frey.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said in a post on X that agents were on the ground in Minneapolis \u201ccracking down on violent rioters and investigating the funding networks supporting the criminal actors with multiple arrests already.\u201d",
      "These investigations follow a December memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi saying a top Justice Department priority was to counter \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d including by investigating groups with an \u201canti-fascist platform that justifies violence and any other means necessary to combat perceived \u2018fascism.\u2019\u201d",
      "The memo, obtained by NBC News, offered a list of possible statutes under which investigators could seek to charge \u201cculpable actors, such as certain Antifa-aligned extremists\u201d who are inspired by \u201cthe types of extreme viewpoints on immigration, radical gender ideology, and anti-American sentiment listed below, with a willingness to use violence against law-abiding citizenry to serve those beliefs.\u201d",
      "The investigation into Becca Good is focused on the first statute listed in Bondi\u2019s memo, a section of the U.S. Code on \u201cassaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers,\u201d the people said.",
      "Last week, President Donald Trump described Renee and Becca Good as \u201cprofessional agitators.\u201d He offered no evidence to support that claim. In the moments after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that what Renee Good had done was \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d",
      "At the same time, the Justice Department has largely abandoned a previous focus on policing accountability, closing up so-called pattern or practice investigations into departments accused of civil rights violations, including the Minneapolis Police Department after the murder of George Floyd.",
      "The investigation into the shooting has prompted turmoil within the Justice Department, including this week\u2019s departure of six prosecutors in Minneapolis who resigned over their concerns. One, Joe Thompson, led a fraud investigation that was cited as part of the reason immigration officers were sent to Minneapolis.",
      "David Kelley, a former federal prosecutor in Minnesota but not one of the six who quit, said the resignations were the \u201cdarkest day for federal law enforcement in my 51 years of practicing law.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen dedicated public servants who have spent their lives prosecuting cases find it necessary to resign because they\u2019re asked to do things that are contrary to their conscience, that is a very sad day for justice in Minnesota,\u201d Kelley told NBC News.",
      "In video from the fatal encounter, cars can be heard honking, sirens wail and protesters are blowing whistles. Ross is seen walking around the front of the car to face Renee Good. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, dude, I\u2019m not mad at you,\u201d Good is heard telling Ross. Another officer near the SUV tells Good, a mother of three and an American citizen, to get out of the car.",
      "In the footage, Ross turns to face the front of the SUV as Becca Good, appears to say, \u201cDrive.\u201d Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive. In Ross\u2019 cellphone footage, he can then be heard shouting what sounds like \u201cwhoa\u201d and firing. Multiple shots can be heard in the video. A male voice is later heard saying: \u201cf-----g bitch.\u201d",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said this week there was \u201ccurrently no basis\u201d for a criminal Civil Rights Division investigation into Ross. Federal officials have noted that internal investigations are underway within the Department of Homeland Security, but Minneapolis officials are concerned about the seriousness of such a probe, particularly because Noem has already said the officer was following his training.",
      "\u201cThis vehicle was used to hit this officer,\u201d Noem said a day after the shooting. \u201cIt was used as a weapon, and the officer feels as though his life was in jeopardy. It was used to perpetuate a violent act, and this officer took action to protect himself and to protect his fellow law enforcement officers.\u201d",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Sam Trepel, a former Civil Rights Division attorney who is now the rule of law program director at States United Democracy Center, said that the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division would normally have played a role that could help ease community tensions through a fulsome investigation into the ICE officer\u2019s actions.",
      "\u201cYou need to do a real, credible investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the Civil Rights Division has had a very long history, dating back even before the division was created, of doing this work, and the idea that they\u2019re not out there protecting the rule of law is scary and painful.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s former domestic terrorism czar, Thomas Brzozowski, told NBC News said it was \u201csuper dangerous\u201d for the DOJ to be using the term \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d \u201cin a manner that is untethered from its statutory framework.\u201d",
      "But under the Bondi memo and other authorities, Brzozowski said, authorities would have carte blanche to launch \u201ca fairly sprawling investigation of those that were connected to the victim and her spouse, which would extend to individuals that perhaps provided training on how to engage in protest activity along those lines.\u201d",
      "The FBI\u2019s domestic terrorism unit \u2014 decimated by the Trump administration following its role investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol \u2014 would normally have to sign off on a broader domestic terrorism probe, according to a former FBI agent who worked on domestic terrorism investigations.",
      "Local officials have said the FBI cut them out of the investigation into the shooting."

      "\u201cI just got stabbed...today in Minnesota,\u201d Jake Lang said in a post on X, alleging he was attacked by a counterprotester. NBC News could not independently verify his claim, and Lang did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lang, a 30-year-old conservative influencer who served four years in jail for alleged crimes in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, was hosting an anti-immigration demonstration with a small group of ICE supporters when hundreds of counterprotesters converged on the scene.",
      "The anti-ICE demonstrators and a group of reporters surrounded Lang and his associates, backing them in a recessed window along the City Hall building.",
      "Counterprotesters could also be seen hurling water balloons at Lang, leaving him soaked in water in the freezing cold. They also threw snowballs at other pro-ICE protesters, soaking them as temperatures dropped toward zero degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Lang repeated to one protester who appeared to be grabbing his legs.",
      "Trevor Folke, a spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department, said in a statement that it was \"aware of social media accounts of him being assaulted,\" referring to Lang, but that a police report has not been filed.",
      "\"MPD encourages anyone who has experienced assaultive behavior to report the incident as soon as possible and provide as much detail as they can, including the date, time, and location of the incident, a description of any suspects, and the nature and extent of any injuries sustained,\" Folke said.",

      "The Minnesota National Guard was mobilized at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, but has not been deployed to city streets, the state Department of Public Safety said Saturday.",

      "Local officials had reportedly expressed concerns that the rally could lead to harassment of Somalis in the community.",
      "Gary said he supports increased immigration operations in the area.",

      "When asked about reports of U.S. citizens stopped by federal officers during traffic stops, Gary said he supports agents questioning and stopping people.",
      "\u201cI got all my identification,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I learned my lesson a long time ago. If you comply with law enforcement, you\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Standing outside his son\u2019s elementary school, a father heard a warning crackle over his walkie-talkie: a suspicious car nearby.",
      "At another school, volunteer Joe Dirkswager stood watch, nodding at passing vehicles. Miles away in St. Paul, Matthew Kearns was questioning unfamiliar individuals near the school he graduated from decades ago.",
      "The three are among the volunteers who have begun patrolling streets around elementary and high schools in the Twin Cities, using walkie-talkies, Signal group chats and whistles to warn families and school staff of immigration enforcement activities. The informal patrols have emerged amid a sharp surge of federal immigration personnel in Minnesota and the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer last week.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed. Patrol volunteers scanned nearby streets and relayed updates in real time.",
      "The father, Greg, a 42-year-old who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns for his family, said the patrols have forced families into impossible decisions on a daily basis.",
      "\u201cEvery morning I feel like I\u2019m forced with the choice of \u2018Do I try to do patrol to protect my daughter and her preschool or do I come to my son\u2019s kindergarten to do patrol here?\u2019\u201d he asked.",
      "\u201cThose are the kind of choices that the community is being faced with.\u201d",
      "Greg and eight other volunteers who spoke with NBC News said the patrols are especially aimed at protecting parents and school staff who are not U.S. citizens and fear being detained while coming and going from schools.",
      "More than 3,000 federal immigration personnel have descended on Minnesota in recent weeks, and more than 2,500 undocumented immigrants have been apprehended in Minneapolis since November, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement push \u2014 dubbed Operation Metro Surge \u2014 follows renewed scrutiny of a state fraud investigation involving a number of individuals of Somali descent, a link that community leaders say has fueled fear beyond those accused.",
      "The heightened enforcement has coincided with clashes between teachers, parents and federal law enforcement officers.",
      "On Wednesday, a parent was detained by ICE at a school bus stop in Robbinsdale, a Minneapolis suburb, according to a statement from Robbinsdale Area Schools Superintendent Teri Staloch. And last week, on the day Good was killed, U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with teachers and protesters at the nearby Roosevelt High School. At least one educator was detained and released, according to the teachers union.",
      "In response to the disruptions, the Minneapolis Public School District said last week it would offer online classes to its roughly 30,000 students until Feb. 12. St. Paul Public Schools, which serves more than 30,000 students, said Thursday it would offer a similar online option and will close school several days next week to prepare.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \u201cICE is not going to schools to arrest children \u2014 we are protecting children,\u201d and that \u201ccriminals are no longer able to hide in America\u2019s schools to avoid arrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur officers are highly trained and in the face of rioting, doxxing, and physical attacks, they have shown professionalism,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are not afraid of loud noises and whistles.\u201d",
      "Bearing witness",
      "Kearns, 56, said the heightened enforcement has been visible beyond the schools where organized patrols first appeared. On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis\u2019 west side  \u2014 which has a large Latino population \u2014 watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cWe have basically a Gestapo coming in and infiltrating our neighborhood and just doing whatever they feel like they want to do,\u201d he said.",
      "The sightings pushed Kearns to begin patrolling the area around his former school.",
      "\u201cI grew up, born and raised here, went to this school, played football here, kissed my wife when I was a little boy,\u201d he said, pointing to a field on the school\u2019s property. \u201cWe protect our kids in our community. I mean, that\u2019s what every other community would do in this situation or any situation.\u201d",
      "As NBC News spoke with Kearns, a handful of volunteers \u2014 most of them parents \u2014 watched nearby. Several appeared visibly shaken, declining to discuss how the patrols were organized or how volunteers communicate, citing safety concerns about publicizing their plans. St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the \u201ccare and concern\u201d from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently. The Minneapolis Public School District did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement.  In recent months, volunteers in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have deployed similar patrols.",
      "Leah Hood, 42, an instructor at a nearby university, said she started patrolling Green Central Elementary School this week after hearing from her friends who were already volunteering. She said the presence of observers feels crucial in a moment when families fear encounters could happen without witnesses.",
      "\u201cI mean, how horrifying that you would be kidnapped off the street while coming and going from school at all?\u201d she asked. \u201cBut how much more horrifying and terrifying is it to think that that could happen and no one would see it, and no one would be able to attest to the fact that this is real, and they did this to you?\u201d",
      "Hood pointed to directives from state and local officials in recent days. Prosecutors have asked the public to submit videos related to Good\u2019s killing, as much of the evidence gathered by the FBI remains inaccessible to local authorities. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week encouraged Minnesotans to \u201cpeacefully film ICE agents as they conduct their activities.\u201d",
      "Kids scared and confused",
      "Parents and teachers who spoke with NBC News said children have been fearful and confused amid the heightened enforcement.",
      "Desiree, who has patrolled Green Central Elementary School for weeks and asked that her last name not be published due to safety concerns, said her son has repeatedly asked about law enforcement sightings nearby.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery to them that something terrible is happening and that it\u2019s happening right around them,\u201d she said.",
      "Greg said the community, shaped by past trauma over George Floyd\u2019s killing, has responded with solidarity.",
      "\u201cYou get on this corner and all day long it\u2019s just cars passing by, and everyone\u2019s waving and saying \u2018thank you\u2019 because we\u2019re all looking out for each other,\u201d he said.",
      "Dirkswager, 38, said the events last week compelled him to patrol Bancroft Elementary School in the Central neighborhood of Minneapolis, blocks away from where Floyd was murdered in 2020.",
      "\u201cThe events last week pushed me to the point where I had to get outside and do something \u2014 even if it\u2019s just standing on a corner and blowing my silly little whistle at federal agents that are driving by,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Republicans, who haven\u2019t won a statewide race in Minnesota in two decades, see a moment to break through. But there are still many factors stacked against them.",
    "story": [
      "Just days into 2026, Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced he would not run for a third term, citing his need to focus on a growing welfare fraud scandal \u2014 a surprise announcement that sent shock waves through the state.",
      "Forty-eight hours later, a 37-year-old woman was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, touching off protests, furious reactions from Democrats and a surge of even more federal immigration personnel to the area as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing national crackdown.",
      "This confluence of events has placed the national spotlight squarely on Minnesota \u2014 and scrambled the political climate at the outset of a critical election year with two statewide contests up for grabs. In addition to Walz, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is also not running for re-election in 2026.",
      "Republicans haven\u2019t won statewide in Minnesota in two decades, and the broader political environment tends to favor the party that\u2019s in the minority in Washington, D.C. But Minnesota Republicans think they may now have an opening, encouraged predominantly by the fraud controversy that\u2019s hanging over Walz.",
      "\u201cDefinitely it gives Republicans a boost and puts several races in play,\u201d Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash said, referring to the fraud allegations. \u201cIt helps paint a broader story about fraud and abuse so people can\u2019t just sit back and say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 It highlights, broadly, the flawed ecosystem of the Democrat Party here in Minnesota, which has had a lock on things for so long.\u201d",
      "A major focus of the Trump administration and Republicans has been the Justice Department\u2019s yearslong fraud investigation that has involved some members of Minnesota\u2019s Somali community. Dozens of suspects were indicted in 2022, during the Biden administration, as part of an alleged $250 million fraud scheme surrounding the nonprofit Feeding Our Future.",
      "More recently, conservative influencers have pushed additional unsubstantiated claims they say are part of the scandal, and Trump has pointed to all of it to make disparaging remarks about people of Somali descent \u2014 and to justify its immigration crackdown in Minnesota.",
      "Significant political challenges still await Republicans. While the Trump administration\u2019s heavy-handed immigration tactics in Democratic-led cities like Minneapolis have received support from the party\u2019s base, there is a risk of backlash from the broader electorate. And in Minnesota, the GOP has struggled to put up strong candidates in statewide races in recent cycles.",
      "But Democrats say the series of developments at the outset of the election year have led to some uncertainty hanging over the party in the state.",
      "\u201cThere is an acknowledgement that we\u2019re going to have a great midterm cycle, and the only state that we\u2019re possibly worried about is Minnesota because of what\u2019s going on here and the kinds of wrinkles that adds to what we have to do this year when it comes to our elections,\u201d said Corey Day, the former executive director of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.",
      "\u201cBut the other thing is that, when it comes to the Republican Party here, one of the things that has always hurt them as a party is just their candidates,\u201d Day added.",
      "At least a dozen Republicans had entered the governor\u2019s race even before Walz decided against seeking a third term. Former state Sen. Scott Jensen, who lost to Walz in 2022, and state House Speaker Lisa Demuth are seen as among the most viable and well-known candidates, though Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a longtime Trump supporter who spread debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election, is also running.",
      "The open Senate race has also drawn a bevy of Republican candidates, including Royce White, a former basketball player who lost to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar in 2024 by 16 percentage points. White\u2019s campaign had been rocked by the emergence of several controversial statements and essays full of incendiary language and epithets.",
      "In addition to White, former state GOP Chair David Hann and former Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze are competing for the Republican Senate nomination.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have a Royce White running in your Senate race and you can\u2019t have \u2018Mr. Pillow\u2019 becoming the nominee for governor,\u201d Day said.",
      "On the Democratic side, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is seriously considering a run for governor. Several Democratic strategists argued she could help insulate the party from attacks on the fraud scandal, pointing to her background as a prosecutor and to the fact that she\u2019s been serving in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re walking into a totally different race if she runs,\u201d said a national Democratic operative with experience working on Minnesota campaigns, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the state of the race.",
      "And in the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are the leading Democratic contenders in a primary where ICE is sure to be a hot-button issue.",
      "Day said that the party\u2019s candidates in races across the state are going to \u201chave to acknowledge what happened,\u201d in reference to the fraud scandal.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to just be aggressive when it comes to our messaging,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has only ramped up his pressure on Minnesota in the wake of the shooting of Renee Nicole Good last week, threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests. His administration has defended the shooting, arguing the ICE officer involved was acting in self-defense, a position that state and local officials have forcefully pushed back against.",
      "Most Republican candidates in statewide races have robustly defended ICE\u2019s presence and tactics in Minneapolis, while GOP operatives maintain their focus on fraud is a winning move.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it is now on such a national scale, with everybody looking at it \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing again for us,\u201d Plechash said. \u201cThese are not unbiased or ungrounded accusations. These are facts, and the more facts come out \u2026 the better it goes for Republicans, because we had nothing to do with it.\u201d",
      "Many Republicans running for governor and Senate have broadened their message to wrap in criticism of Democratic control of state government. Walz, Democrats\u2019 2024 vice presidential nominee, rose to prominence during his second term for enacting a number of progressive policies.",
      "Demuth, the GOP state House speaker and gubernatorial candidate, has aggressively connected the fraud to a wider message of fiscal responsibility, noting that Walz spent much of the state\u2019s $18 billion surplus back in 2023 to fund those policies.",
      "\u201cWe watched an $18 billion surplus be spent and not returned to the taxpayers. What you\u2019re seeing is a landscape where Minnesotans are becoming more educated on what has happened under Democratic control,\u201d Demuth said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s part of why the landscape is so favorable to Republicans in 2026.\u201d",
      "In another interview last week on Fox News, Demuth pointed to the growing unrest in Minneapolis over the ICE shooting as a potential campaign message.",
      "\u201cPeople can peacefully protest anytime, but getting in the way of federal agents, not supporting law enforcement, damaging buildings and not peacefully protesting is unacceptable here in the state of Minnesota,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a perfect opportunity for different, solid, responsible leadership here in the state of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Jensen, another Republican candidate, also painted the alleged \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d as the product of years of a \u201cheavily dominated Democrat governance model.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the right\u2019s messaging approach in Minnesota has started to spread to other states.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate for governor in Ohio, Vivek Ramaswamy, jeered Minnesota at a rally last week in Cleveland to introduce his running mate for lieutenant governor, state Senate President Rob McColley.",
      "\u201cDo we want Ohio to become Tim Walz\u2019s Minnesota?\u201d Ramaswamy said, drawing a loud chorus of \u201cNo!\u201d from a crowd of several hundred. \u201cRiddled with waste, fraud, abuse, welfare, waste, socialism, victimhood psychology and ultimate failure?\u201d",
      "McColley put a finer point on it, linking Walz to Ohio\u2019s likely Democratic nominee for governor, Amy Acton, the state\u2019s former health director.",
      "\u201cI will not stand by and watch Amy Acton turn Ohio into what we\u2019re seeing in states like Minnesota,\u201d he said.",
      "Other Republican strategists said that any gains the party is able to make in 2026 could help propel it even further in the 2028 presidential race \u2014 especially if the party can build out a stronger organization. The party hasn\u2019t carried Minnesota at that level since 1972.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to really uncover the serious problems that have taken place under [Democratic] leadership,\u201d said Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota-based Republican strategist, adding that the party is likely in its best position since former Republican Tim Pawlenty\u2019s two terms as governor ended 15 years ago to win statewide races in this year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cAnd then,\u201d Samsundar said, \u201cthat definitely opens the door for a national win in 2028.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:10:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chicago Bears have made several odds-defying, comeback wins this year that have left their opponents devastated.",
    "story": [
      "After another improbable comeback win, the Chicago Bears were gathered in their locker room, waiting for head coach Ben Johnson to speak, when he let out a guttural scream. \u201cF--- the Packers, man,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cF--- them!\u201d",
      "The players roared with laughter and glee. Chicago had just beaten the Green Bay Packers, its hated rival, in the wild card round of the NFL playoffs \u2014 the Bears\u2019 first playoff win in 15 years.",
      "Once Johnson calmed down, he addressed the team. \u201cYou look up at halftime, in this game, and it\u2019s 21-3,\u201d he said. \u201cNo f---ing panic \u2026 built for pressure. That\u2019s you guys!\u201d",
      "The Chicago Bears haven\u2019t had this much swagger in a long time, maybe not since the 1980s, when they were the Monsters of the Midway. Since 2011, the Bears have had more last-place finishes in their division (seven) than playoff berths (three). On one of the few occasions they did make the playoffs, their season ended on a missed kick that was so heartbreaking it was given its own moniker: the double doink.",
      "This year, the Bears have reversed roles. They have mounted several odds-defying comeback wins that have left their opponents devastated. They\u2019ve won seven games \u2014 including last week\u2019s win over the Packers \u2014 with a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime. Now, a new moniker has been coined: the Cardiac Bears. Local journalists have gone as far as to interview actual cardiac specialists, asking how Bears games might affect fans\u2019 hearts.",
      "On Sunday, in the divisional round, the Bears will face their toughest test yet in the Los Angeles Rams, a team that boasts an elite head coach (Sean McVay), an MVP candidate at quarterback (Matthew Stafford) and a young defense with a vicious pass rush. The Rams have been perennial contenders in recent years, whereas the Bears are \u2026 new to the scene.",
      "The Bears have a rookie head coach in Johnson, the former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator, who\u2019s considered a wunderkind; a second-year quarterback in Caleb Williams; and two rookie pass-catchers who\u2019ve emerged as Williams\u2019 top targets, Colston Loveland and Luther Burden III.",
      "All season, this group faced some long odds together. Those seven games the Bears won late? In each instance, Chicago\u2019s \u201cwin probability\u201d dipped lower than 25% at some point in the fourth quarter, according to ESPN Analytics, before the Bears made their move.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a belief with this team that shows up each and every week,\u201d Johnson said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of who we are here at this point.\u201d",
      "A major catalyst for the comebacks has been Williams, the Bears\u2019 quarterback. Chicago drafted him No. 1 overall in 2024 out of USC, where he had gained a reputation for his playground-like ability to improvise plays. Last season, under a previous coaching regime, Williams largely struggled and was sacked 68 times, the third-most in a single year in NFL history.",
      "The Bears then hired Johnson as head coach, and under his tutelage, Williams has flourished. Despite the occasional hiccup, Williams seems to be playing with more poise, more purpose \u2014 especially in the fourth quarter, when the game is on the line. During the regular season, Williams recorded his highest number of passing yards (1,096), most touchdowns (10) and most rushing yards (129) in the game\u2019s final frame. He also posted a much higher quarterback rating in situations where his team was losing (97.8) than when it was ahead (79.8).",
      "All of those comebacks helped the Bears go 11-6 and win the NFC North. That earned them a home game last week, in the wild card round, against the Packers. The first playoff game for Williams and Johnson, Chicago was losing 21-3 at halftime, 21-6 entering the fourth quarter, and then \u2026 the Bears outscored the Packers 25-6 the rest of the way. In that quarter alone, Williams threw for 184 yards and two touchdowns and made a number of clutch plays.",
      "With less than six minutes to go, the Bears were trailing by 11 points and facing a fourth-and-8 situation in their own territory. If they failed to convert, their season would have likely been over. Instead, Williams rolled to his left, leaped in the air and hurled the ball downfield, all in one motion \u2014 and completed a 27-yard pass. It wasn\u2019t a high-percentage pass. But for Williams and these Bears, it worked. Afterward, many fans recognized that as Williams jumped, he\u2019d contorted his body in such a way that he resembled Michael Jordan\u2019s \u201cJumpman\u201d Nike logo. The pose is also immortalized in a statue of Jordan at the Chicago Bulls\u2019 United Center.",
      "Now, can the Bears beat the Rams and continue this run? Is this type of play sustainable for another week? Another two? Beyond this season? Chicago hasn\u2019t secured back-to-back playoff berths since the 2005 and 2006 seasons. At this point, it might be difficult to say, at least before we see the fourth quarter play out Sunday night. If Johnson, Williams and the rest of the Bears have proved anything this season, it might be unwise to count them out until then."

      "Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix\u2019s season is done after he broke a bone in his right ankle late in the Broncos\u2019 33-30 overtime win against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.",
      "Broncos coach Sean Payton announced postgame Nix sustained the injury only three plays before Denver kicked a game-winning field goal. Jarrett Stidham will now start for Denver, the top seed in the AFC, in the conference championship game next Sunday.",
      "The shocking news came after Nix became the first QB not named Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow to defeat Josh Allen in the postseason this decade.",
      "The Broncos won after a back-and-forth battle in the fourth quarter and overtime.",
      "After two scoreless drives to open the extra period, Nix led Denver on a 75-yard jaunt for the game-winning score, aided by two pass interference penalties on the Bills. Allen forced overtime by getting Buffalo into field-goal position in the final minute of regulation, but he threw an interception in OT that set up the Broncos\u2019 winning field goal \u2014 his fourth turnover of the day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, I feel like I let my teammates down tonight,\u201d Allen, while wiping away tears, said postgame.",
      "He added: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long season. Hate how it ended. It\u2019s gonna stick with me for a long time.\u201d",
      "For Nix, Saturday\u2019s win was a statement effort in what was only his second career postseason start.",
      "A year after he threw for only 144 yards in a 31-7 loss to the Bills in the wild card round, Nix threw for 279 yards and three scores in a victory.",
      "His most impressive drive of the game came in the fourth quarter. Trailing 27-23, Nix spearheaded an eight-play, 73-yard drive capped by a 26-yard touchdown pass to give Denver a 30-27 lead with under a minute to go.",
      "Nix also came through in the final period, as his willingness to throw the ball deep led to two defensive pass interference penalties on Buffalo \u2014 one for 17 yards, and another for 30 that put the Broncos inside the 10-yard line.",
      "\u201cHe was fantastic when we needed him,\u201d Broncos head coach Sean Payton said after.",
      "For Allen, the loss was the latest in a string of devastating defeats for a franchise that\u2019s become synonymous with postseason heartbreak. After losing four straight Super Bowls in the 1990s, Buffalo has now failed to make it back to the championship round for the seventh straight season of Allen\u2019s tenure.",
      "Including Saturday, four of the Bills\u2019 last five playoff losses have come in one-score games, including two in overtime. The combined margin of defeat in those four losses is only 15 points.",
      "Allen\u2019s performance was boom or bust, as every Buffalo drive ended in either a score or a turnover. Allen finished the game 25 of 39 for 283 yards and three touchdowns, running 12 times for another 66 yards. But he also threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles. The four turnovers came at especially inopportune moments, including an ill-advised cough-up right before halftime that gifted Denver three points.",
      "\u201cJust trying to be aggressive, can\u2019t do that,\u201d Allen said of the play.",
      "Allen\u2019s final interception came in overtime when a Bills field goal would have ended the game.",
      "Leading into this postseason, Allen\u2019s playoff defeats had come largely at the hands of some of the conference\u2019s best quarterbacks. But with Mahomes, Burrow and two-time MVP Lamar Jackson all absent from the playoff field, Buffalo appeared to have its most favorable path to its first Super Bowl appearance since the 1993 season.",
      "Instead, Allen \u2014 who had gone six straight postseason games without a turnover \u2014 gave the ball away four times and was ultimately outdueled by Nix.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t win with five turnovers,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI fumbled twice, threw two picks. When you shoot yourself in the foot like that you don\u2019t deserve to win football games.\u201d",
      "Said Payton: \u201cWe obviously weren\u2019t ready last year, but we were ready today.\u201d"

      "BEIJING \u2014 One of the most popular new apps in China poses an awkward question: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d",
      "An app by that name has gone viral as a digital \u201ccheck-in\u201d aimed mainly at the growing number of young people living alone in China\u2019s sprawling cities. The idea is to designate an emergency contact person, who will be alerted if a user goes a few days without confirming their well-being on the app.",
      "The app, which was free when it launched last May but now costs 8 yuan ($1.14), was the most downloaded paid app in Apple\u2019s App Store for China in recent days - though after its viral popularity, it appears to have since disappeared from the Chinese App Store under unclear circumstances.",
      "The app describes itself as a personal safety assistant, \u201cwhether you are a professional living solo, a student studying far from home, or anyone choosing an independent lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Ian Guo, one of the founders, told NBC News he was surprised by the success of the app, which cost less than $150 to make and is now valued at around $15 million.",
      "He said he and his two co-founders, who like him are members of China\u2019s \u201cpost-95 generation,\u201d were inspired by social media commenters who said this was something they needed.",
      "\u201cWe saw this opportunity and asked ourselves if we could quickly launch a product,\u201d Guo said. But they also believed the app \u201ccould truly provide people with more security and protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally lived alone in Shenzhen for a long time, so I understand the various problems one faces when living solo,\u201d he said, adding that the sense of loneliness and insecurity \u201cis constant.\u201d",
      "Though the concept may sound morbid, the app\u2019s popularity is a reflection of demographic changes in China, where urbanization, falling marriage rates and long work hours have left many feeling isolated.",
      "By 2030, China \u2014 a nation of 1.4 billion people \u2014 could have 200 million one-person households, according to the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which cited real estate research institutions.",
      "The app\u2019s name in Mandarin, \u201cSi Le Ma,\u201d appeared to be a play on the name of one of China\u2019s most popular food delivery apps, \u201cE Le Ma,\u201d which means \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d Some found its emphasis on death too dark, and the app has now been renamed Demumu, which Guo said was \u201ccuter.\u201d",
      "\"\u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 sounds more like a joke,\" says Lisa Li, a 23 year old English teacher, \"But Are You Alive? sounds like you\u2019re rising from the dead and that would be even weirder.\"",
      "Li, 23, said she found the app \u201ca bit absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be afraid that if I were forgetful and missed a check-in, people would actually think I\u2019m dead,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she thought most people were downloading the app out of curiosity. \u201cSome people really do worry that if they die, no one will find them,\u201d she added, pointing to a recent string of highly publicized cases of young Chinese professionals, particularly at tech companies, dying suddenly after long periods of intense work.",
      "Cui Xiyue, an exhibition planner in Beijing, said she downloaded the app when she was \u201cgoing through a period of depression and mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust getting through a single day back then wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Cui, 23.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got it, I checked in every day, but I didn\u2019t stick with it for very long,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need it anymore because I\u2019ve stopped thinking about those dark things.\u201d",
      "Loneliness has long been a concern for older people in China, where more than one-fifth of the population is over 60. When younger family members migrate from rural areas to cities, they are often left behind.",
      "But social isolation is also a problem for young Chinese, who are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children amid the rising cost of living and competition for jobs.",
      "Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said she thought the app would be helpful for young people living alone.",
      "\u201cOf course, to some extent they are joking, it\u2019s more sarcastic,\u201d said Tong, co-director of the university\u2019s Centre for Chinese Family Studies. On the other hand, she said, the app could lead people to reflect on their single life.",
      "Some commenters on Chinese social media were skeptical of the app\u2019s usefulness.",
      "\u201cDo people really use apps like this? If I get busy and forget to check in, wouldn\u2019t I end up \u2018dying\u2019 every other day?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",

      "Tong said loneliness was less of a problem for young people than for older people because they are \u201cmore adaptive\u201d when it comes to using the internet to connect with the outside world.",
      "\u201cSome of the activities can be transferred offline,\u201d she said, pointing to the thousands of people who showed up in a village outside the Chinese city of Chongqing to help a young woman and her father slaughter pigs for a traditional banquet after she posted a callout last week on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.",
      "\u201cYoung people can find a way to overcome their own loneliness,\u201d Tong said, \u201cif they\u2019re really willing to.\u201d",

      "\"Yeah, but you're handsome,\" Mellencamp said before slapping five with Al.",

      "\"Oh my God,\" Craig said, trying to catch his breath.",
      "\"You just made Craig Melvin's day,\" Al said.",
      "\"It did,\" Craig said. \"Maybe my year. That is a clip that will live in infamy, John Mellencamp. It will be right after the 'Jack and Diane' video.\"",

      "Though it's only just begun, a steady stream of well-wishers and guests have already dropped by Studio 1A to congratulate the new duo, including Kathie Lee Gifford, Hoda Kotb and legendary talk show host, Oprah Winfrey.",
      "Winfrey joined Jenna and Sheinelle to talk about \u201cEnough: Your Health, Your Weight and What It\u2019s Like to Be Free,\u201d a new book co-written with Ania M. Jastreboff, MD, about the science and myths behind obesity.",
      "Before getting underway, however, Winfrey first gave Sheinelle a congratulatory hug saying, \"Love, love, love\" before sitting in on the morning chat.",
      "In addition to those encouraging words, Winfrey tells TODAY.com that she has another affirmation to pass along to Sheinelle as she embarks on the latest chapter of her life.",
      "\u201cLive the dream. You have to allow yourself to move, to lean into living the dream,\u201d the OWN founder said in a one-on-one interview with TODAY.com. \u201cMy affirmation is, \u2018Live the dream.\u201d",

      "\"On my Mount Rushmore of Oprah and Maria Shriver, there are names that you may not know. Allison Payne, Carole Simpson, who was the first one woman of color I ever saw on television,\" Sheinelle said.",

      "\"I haven't pictured myself on a Mount Rushmore. I feel that is earned,\" she said. And while she may not necessarily be ready to join the ranks of her heroes, she does feel that with everything she's been through, she's earned her \"stripes.\"",
      "\"When you think of a veteran or someone in the military, and they come in a room and they have their stripes, there's an aura to them, there's a wisdom to some of them, especially some of the great generals. And the stripes that they have, you can't take that away from them. You can't take their journey away from them,\" Sheinelle said.",
      "\"What I will give myself now is with everything I've been through and everything I've done to earn this spot in my career, I do believe that I have stripes. You can't see them, but I know they can't be taken away.\"",
      "While some of those stripes have been earned along her career path, they've also come from tremendous personal loss.",
      "In May of this past year, Sheinelle's husband of 18 years, Uche Ojeh, died from an aggressive form of brain cancer, followed by the passing of her beloved \"Grandmama,\" Josephine Vonceal Pace Brown in December.",
      "\"I'm not a general in the military, but I am a general in life at this point,\" she said of what she's been through.",
      "Even so, she's also ready to embrace this pivotal moment in her career. A moment Sheinelle said she's been pursuing since elementary school and cites one of her favorite quotes, which, unsurprisingly, comes from Winfrey.",
      "\"God has bigger dreams for you than you can dream for yourself,\" said Sheinelle. \"Well, I've hit that mark now where I feel like the dream for me if bigger than I dream for myself.\"",
      "As for what lies ahead, Sheinelle said for perhaps the first time in her life, she's not entirely sure.",
      "\"I don't think think it's by accident that this is happening to me right now. I really don't. It makes me a little anxious and I still don't know why things happen the way they do,\" Sheinelle said.",
      "\"But I feel so clear in this moment that this is where I need to be right here, right now.\""

      "Why Are People Nostalgic for 2016?",
      "Routledge, also an executive vice president and COO at Archbridge Institute, adds that millennials and older Gen Z are the ones most affected by \u201ctechnological transformations\u201d amid the advances of artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to be nostalgic when they\u2019re anxious about the future or they\u2019re not sure what direction in life to take,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I think this generation is dealing with those anxieties, and they\u2019re using nostalgia as a way to respond to them.\u201d",

      "On Instagram, content creator Steffy Degreff reflected on days when her hair was short and she was \u201cnewly living in new york & urban outfitters flatlays & cozy oversized cardigans.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any year realizes it is up to the hype until the time has passed \u2014 but to me it was a really great year,\u201d Degreff tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to romanticize the past, at a time when the internet was still blossoming and felt so much simpler.\u201d",
      "She adds that she thinks the 2016 trend has impacted people because they realize \u201chow attached to the Instagram app they have been for a decade, and all of the iterations of change that social media has gone through \u2014 which impacts the way we live our life, and the way we share it.\u201d",
      "YouTuber and baker Rosanna Pansino remembers waiting for #ThrowbackThursdays to post old photos and being carefree about what you posted.",

      "Routledge says that it doesn't have to be the year 2016 specifically for people to be nostalgic. He explains that the way nostalgia works is people tend to have more time to curate the memories and the experiences that they found happy, energizing or inspirational.",
      "As time goes by, they have more time to \u201cput aside the negatives, or if we are thinking about the negatives, we\u2019ve had more time to integrate that negative into a more redemptive or useful story.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you go through something and it\u2019s difficult at the moment, you don\u2019t really appreciate it, but after some time has passed, you can say, \u2018Well, maybe I learned something from that. It\u2019s made me who I am. It\u2019s helped me grow as a person,\u2019\u201d he adds."

      "The 61-year-old reality star and actress has joined Season 4 of Peacock\u2019s \"The Traitors,\" and she\u2019s already proving why she might be one of the season\u2019s most dangerous players. (Peacock and TODAY share a parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Rinna isn\u2019t the only Housewife competing this season. She\u2019s joined by Porsha Williams (\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\"), Candiace Dillard Bassett (\u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\"), Caroline Stanbury (\"The Real Housewives of Dubai\") and Dorinda Medley (\"The Real Housewives of New York City\"), making it one of the most Bravo-packed casts yet.",
      "The hit competition series drops contestants in a Scottish castle where deception is the name of the game. Hidden traitors work to eliminate players one by one while trying to avoid detection from the faithful contestants attempting to unmask them.",
      "Lisa Rinna Is a Traitor on Season 4",
      "Rinna was selected as one of the season\u2019s traitors during the opening roundtable ceremony, arriving in a head-to-toe leopard print ensemble (pants, long sleeve top and tie all in matching print) that perfectly captured her bold personality.",
      "The Bravo star couldn\u2019t contain her excitement about the role. \u201cMy heart is pounding out of my chest. I\u2019m happy. I get to lie, deceive, and kill people!\u201d she celebrated, throwing her hands triumphantly in the air.",
      "Rinna isn\u2019t approaching the game half-heartedly. \u201cI want to be the most iconic Traitors player ever,\u201d she announced, making her intentions crystal clear from the start.",
      "As for why she might be perceived as dangerous? \u201cWhy am I a threat? Well, I think because I\u2019m Lisa f---ing Rinna,\u201d she told host Alan Cumming with the confidence only she could deliver.",
      "Who Is Lisa Rinna?",
      "Lisa Rinna is an actor and television personality who has been a fixture in entertainment for over three decades.",
      "She\u2019s been married to actor Harry Hamlin since 1997, and the couple shares two daughters: Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray, both of whom have pursued modeling careers.",
      "Rinna\u2019s blend of humor, honesty and willingness to stir the pot made her a fan favorite (and occasional villain) throughout her reality TV tenure. She\u2019s active on social media, where she continues to engage with her devoted fanbase.",
      "What Is Lisa Rinna Known For?",
      "Rinna first gained recognition in the soap opera world, playing Billie Reed on \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1992 to 1995. She reprised the role multiple times over the years, including a return in 2002-2003 and again in recent years.",
      "She also had a memorable run on \"Melrose Place\" from 1996 to 1998, and competed on \"Dancing with the Stars\" Season 2 in 2006, finishing in fourth place.",
      "However, Rinna is perhaps best known for her nine-season stint on \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" which she joined in 2014. During her time on the Bravo series, she became known for her candor, her short haircut and her ability to generate headline-making moments. She departed the show in 2023 after Season 13.",
      "Beyond reality TV, Rinna has appeared in various acting roles, hosted talk shows, and launched business ventures including a clothing line."

      "The popularity of \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d which tells the story of multiple NHL players who are closeted, has led one real-life hockey player to come out as gay.",
      "The main romance in \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d streaming on HBO Max, follows rival players Ilya (Connor Storrie) and Shane (Hudson Williams) and their secret relationship that spans multiple years. But one episode centers around the storyline between another closeted player named Scott Hunter (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud), who falls for an employee he meets at a smoothie shop named Kip (Robbie G.K.).",
      "At the end of Episode 5, Scott decides to publicly come out and invites Kip onto the ice to celebrate with him after his team wins the Stanley Cup. Scott and Kip share a passionate kiss and the hockey star later expresses his love for Kip while accepting an award.",
      "After seeing the show and being inspired by the storylines, hockey player Jesse Kortuem decided to publicly come out.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook Jan. 13, Kortuem wrote that the sounds heard in a hockey arena used to represent \u201cthe sound of a place where I felt I had to hide.\u201d",
      "The athlete, who recently participated in the Cutting Edges Hockey Club\u2019s Winter Classic event, added, \u201cI am a private person. Those who know me best know that I don\u2019t share much if anything publicly on social media, but lately, something has sparked in me (ok \u2014 yes credit to #HeatedRivalry). I realized it is finally time to share a journey I have kept close to the vest for a long time.\u201d",
      "Kortuem said he grew up in Minnesota as the youngest of four boys.",
      "\u201cAs a young teenager, I carried a weight that did not seem to fit into that world, and I lived in a constant state of dichotomy. I loved the game, but I lived with a persistent fear,\u201d he shared. \u201cI wondered how I could be gay and still play such a tough and masculine sport.\u201d",
      "He said his younger self never thought that coming out was possible as a professional hockey player. \u201cComing out in the 2000s did not feel like an option, especially with so little positive representation in the media at the time and it would have been a social disaster at such a large high school. At 17, I walked away from the high school team and the brotherhood of hockey friendships I had developed from a young age for a myriad of reasons,\u201d he explained.",
      "After stepping away, he returned to hockey and played \u201cat a high level\u201d in New York and Atlanta. He said people in his life knew he was gay, but he didn\u2019t speak about his sexuality with his teammates.",
      "\u201cOn the outside, I was still a top-tier player. On the inside, I was still that kid in Minnesota hiding,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike many closeted athletes, revealing who I truly was to my team would change everything in an instant, their opinion of me, could bring negative attention to the team with the \u2018gay player\u2019, so I never took the chance.\u201d",
      "He remembered changing the subject if the other players mentioned their wives, and he always told them he was single. But he \u201creached a breaking point in 2017\u201d after he signed up to play in a gay sporting event.",
      "\u201cThis tournament would prove to be a paradigm shift. I met a group of guys from across the US and Canada (Las Vegas Boyz) who were hockey players like me and were also gay,\u201d Kortuem said. \u201cFrom that moment forward, my life has never been the same. It has been a long, vulnerable road to move past the closeted athlete persona (something I\u2019m still working on today) and find actual peace through the friendships I have developed through hockey in Vancouver (Cutting Edges), Toronto (Misfits), and across the US.\u201d",
      "He said during his most recent event with the Cutting Edges Hockey Club, he finally felt \u201cpeace\u201d on the rink.",
      "Kortuem ended his post with an uplifting message to other closeted athletes.",
      "\u201cThis is my story. It is not everyone\u2019s story, but for what it is worth, I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you\u2019re not alone. There is a life and a deep happiness waiting for you on your path. You will get through this, and it is going to be okay,\u201d he said.",
      "According to Out, Kortuem never played in the NHL, however, he did play defenseman and center in multiple other leagues.",
      "\u201cI know many closeted and gay men in the hockey world are being hit hard by \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019\u2019s success,\u201d Kortuem said when speaking to Out about how he personally connected to the show. \u201cNever in my life did I think something so positive and loving could come from such a masculine sport. I\u2019ve struggled the last few weeks to put these emotions into words, fearing the impact on team dynamics, etc.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cToday, I took the step to finally tell my hockey journey and my story. I\u2019m beyond grateful for all the positive comments I\u2019ve received from past teammates and high school teammates.\u201d"

    "summary": "Connor Storrie discusses \"Heated Rivalry's\" success, meeting Rachel Reid and his chemistry with Hudson Williams.",
    "story": [
      "Mere months ago, Connor Storrie was a guy working at restaurants while chasing a Hollywood dream. Now, he\u2019s one half of the duo at the heart of \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d the hottest TV show out there right now.",
      "If he\u2019s being honest, as he said on TODAY this week, he hasn\u2019t really had a second to \u201ctake it in.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d based on a 2019 book by the author Rachel Reid that tells a love story between two pro hockey players, was a project intended for a small Canadian streamer called Crave. When HBO Max picked up the show in the U.S. shortly before its November premiere, Storrie and his co-star, Hudson Williams, found themselves in the big leagues. As viewership rose, so did their stars. These two got big-time famous, in a way that now draws crowds of admirers wherever they go, including here at 30 Rock.",
      "For the show, Storrie, a 25-year-old Texas native, transforms into Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hockey prodigy with a thick accent, a complicated family and an irresistible attraction to a rival player. Both Storrie and Williams, who plays Shane Hollander, say they had chemistry from the jump, a key piece of the show that speaks to just how much audiences adore this story. \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d was picked up for Season 2 midway through the first season. Storrie told Craig Melvin on TODAY they may start shooting this summer.",
      "Storrie had shared that and much more on TODAY when he visited Studio 1A for a pair of live interviews. (And a tuna melt demo.) (And plaza fun with Al Roker.) And TODAY.com was able to catch up with Storrie in his green room in between it all.",
      "Storrie, in a designer bomber jacket and jeans, all curls and charisma, sat comfortably in a director\u2019s chair in front of a brightly lit vanity. The windows behind him, though curtained, looked out at all the fans who braved sub-40\u00b0 weather for a glimpse of him. He told us about meeting Reid, what he hopes to see next on-screen from Shane and Ilya\u2019s relationship and what he gives credit to regarding his electric chemistry with Williams.",
      "I think that Jacob just \u2014 he read the books a million times, and obviously wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages worth of scripts. He just knew this story backward and forward. I think he also was just such a fan that he saw whatever the fans of the book saw \u2014 that thing that makes everyone love this story.",
      "What that is, I think, can be a few different things. I think the love, the spice, the world, the connection. I think he was just a really, really big fan, and I think that love poured over into his interpretation of it.",
      "Everything that Jacob wrote in that monologue totally tracks, and I think that it really honors the book. Everything that (Ilya) has going on in his personal life, I kind of just have to click into that and believe that. And those words are so powerful that I think you can\u2019t really help but be moved. Professing your love for someone, especially in such a stressful moment, having this cathartic outbreak, you can\u2019t help but be emotional if you believe in it."

      "It was during this discussion that fans noticed Ilya gleefully gobbling down mouthfuls of spaghetti.",
      "During the 3rd Hour of TODAY, he sat with cohosts Craig Melvin, Dylan Dreyer and Al Roker to discuss his Russian accent, skating skills and more. Then Dylan asked him if chowing down was part of his character or if \u201che was just ready for pasta.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very LA; I don\u2019t do a lot carbs or gluten,\u201d Storrie revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my thing. So I think I was just really relishing in the excuse to eat pasta for the first time for a long time.\u201d",
      "He added that a producer then showed him a take where another one of his own mannerisms came through.",
      "\u201cI guess I do a little dance while I\u2019m eating, like I\u2019m a little kid,\u201d he said to laughter from the cohosts. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I do that, but now, even in my real life, I kind of find it sometimes.\u201d",
      "While Storrie jokes his spaghetti-scarfing was not \u201ccharacter work\u201d but \u201cjust pasta,\u201d fans of the show dug a little deeper into its meaning.",
      "\u201cThe background detail of Ilya just shoveling pasta into his face in the finale of \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019 is there for so much more than just a small laugh,\u201d Instagram user Cassandra Morann said in a viral fan analysis.",
      "\u201cIlya feels so safe here, and even David is looking out for Ilya. He\u2019s giving him more food. He even tells him he gets Russian vodka. The care for Shane and by proxy, for Shane\u2019s partner, is so evident that Ilya immediately gets put at ease,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he is just happily chowing down because he has been through actual hell.\u201d"

    "summary": "What zodiac signs are the cast of The Traitors Season 4? Here's who is an Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.",
    "story": [
      "Some of our favorite reality stars, athletes, actors, and icons have come together to form the cast of Season 4 of \"The Traitors.\"",
      "The Peacock series, hosted by Alan Cumming (an Aquarius), premiered on January 8 and showcases celebrities such as Johnny Weir, Dorinda Medley, and Ron Funches, among others.",
      "Looking at the cast, it\u2019s important to note their zodiac signs to understand how they\u2019ll interact and play together. There are no Leos or Capricorns, but plenty of mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) to stir the pot. With Episodes 1 to 3 already aired, we are seeing major drama unfold.",
      "Read below to find out what zodiac sign is more likely to be a Traitor or Faithful.",
      "Aries",
      "Aries are driven to excel. Being that they are the first sign of the zodiac, they are full of bravado and gusto \u2014 so much so that the warrior sign won\u2019t stop until they peak to great heights. Aries will never allow themselves to be the sacrificial ram, making them a force to be reckoned with. They are born to conquer!",
      "Taurus",
      "Tauruses are great at gathering background information on the contestants, much like Carolyn Stanbury stated in Episode 1 of Season 4. However, that does not mean they\u2019re gossipy. The Bull likes to be in the know because it can manage the environment and be in tune with the energy that surrounds it without breaking a sweat, thereby defeating others.",
      "Gemini",
      "Geminis have a dualistic and duplicitous side to them, making them the perfect person to cause a ruckus on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201c The twin star might spill the tea, twist facts, and slip in some side eye to get their way \u2014 basically, the air sign will do anything to get their hands on the cash prize and the acclaim they crave.",
      "Cancer",
      "Cancers can be secretive at times, as their planetary ruler is the moon. Since their emotions change every few days from the lunar phases, they\u2019re tricky to read. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, which is why anyone who messes with a crab better watch out. Their pincers are no joke!",
      "Virgo",
      "Virgos are going to be methodical and authentic. Their approach to situations is based on what unfolds before their eyes. Then, they can assess and decide how they want to proceed, mindfully and cautiously. The earth sign may appear sweet and innocent, but its shadow side can be competitive and cutthroat \u2014 especially when it comes to money, acclaim and success.",
      "Libra",
      "Libras are fair-minded, meaning they will not veer from the rules unless they have to. While they put on a nice front, Libras can flirt with danger. If they are a Traitor or a Faithful, odds are that they\u2019ll be diplomatic in how they move forward on the show. Throughout the process, they\u2019ll have a smile on their faces.",
      "Scorpio",
      "Scorpio is a zodiac sign that knows how to plot and manipulate to get what they want and use information to their advantage. If anyone stands in their way, Scorpio\u2019s stingers come out. Those who are born under this sign assert their power and control situations with their authoritative and intense presence. One could say they would make the best Traitor!",
      "Sagittarius",
      "The archer is the only constellation that is both a protector and warrior \u2014 anyone who acts against them will have to watch their back. Sagittarius likes to have the last word, which means they aren\u2019t going anywhere without a fight or drama. The other contestants better beware! Lying might be hard, since they are known for their brutal honesty.",
      "Aquarius",
      "The air sign might play aloof, but they have their head in the game. Expect the Aquarian contestants to be low-key messy behind the scenes as they plot their strategy, but be nice to the faces of those who are their adversaries. They\u2019ll use their intellect and mindfulness to secure the bag. Watch out, because you\u2019ll never see them coming!",
      "Pisces",
      "Pisces is an intuitive sign that uses its sixth sense to rise above the rest. These players may have an inkling who their opponents are, but not proof. Plus, Pisces are great at deflecting energy. Their secretive nature allows them to trick others into trusting them, as they won\u2019t reveal any clues. Pisces can win based on a hunch or vibe.",

    "story": [
      "Has Europe had enough?",
      "After more than a year of cautious diplomacy, high-stakes flattery and efforts to keep trans-Atlantic cooperation intact, European leaders now find themselves confronting perhaps the sharpest challenge yet from the White House.",
      "President Donald Trump said Saturday he will impose sweeping new tariffs on eight key European allies that will ratchet up unless Denmark agrees to hand over Greenland, resurrecting one of his most provocative foreign policy obsessions as he threatens the territory of a NATO ally.",
      "The ultimatum marks the latest escalation in a pattern that has seen Europe repeatedly forced onto the back foot during Trump\u2019s second administration, weighing economic and security ties with the U.S. against a White House increasingly willing to weaponize trade against its closest partners.",
      "But this time the response has been sharper.",
      "European leaders moved quickly to convene an emergency meeting on Sunday, condemning the tariff threats as unacceptable and warning of serious consequences for trans-Atlantic relations.",
      "The episode has raised fresh questions about how much longer Europe is willing to absorb pressure from Washington in the name of a NATO alliance that appears to be bursting at the seams.",
      "Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland are facing new 10% tariffs until \u201ca Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\u201d the U.S. leader said Saturday, with duties increasing to 25% if a deal is not reached by June 1.",
      "It is a familiar position for European leaders, who spent much of last spring negotiating with Washington as Trump sought to reshape global trade through tariffs. The U.S. already has a framework agreement with the European Union capping tariffs at 15%, alongside a separate deal with the U.K. limiting duties to 10%.",
      "Trump did not say whether the newly threatened tariffs would override those agreements or be imposed on top of them.",
      "But the latest threats have drawn signs of fatigue and impatience with the U.S., as European leaders, long reluctant to confront Trump directly, appear newly united in defending Denmark\u2019s territory and pushing back against what they see as an unacceptable escalation.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has often acted as an intermediary between Washington and Europe in the effort to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, while the U.K. was the first nation to strike a deal to reverse or cut some of Trump\u2019s earlier tariffs.",
      "But Starmer said Saturday that Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on European allies were \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d a rare departure from what had appeared to be a policy of U.S. appeasement that has drawn criticism from lawmakers in his own country.",
      "\u201cApplying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who has recently issued dire warnings about the collapse of U.S.-Europe relations, said \u201cno amount of intimidation\u201d will persuade European nations to change their course on Greenland. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned the E.U. would not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d by Trump, while Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said \u201cthreats have no place among allies.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the eight nations threatened with tariffs said Sunday that \u201ctariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\u201d the statement said, ahead of an emergency E.U. meeting.",
      "Trump has stood firm in his belief that the U.S. requires Greenland for its national security, and has repeated assertions that Russia and China will try to seize Greenland otherwise.",
      "\u201cThere is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\u201d Trump wrote, referring to Danish defense capabilities as \u201ctwo dogsleds as protection.\u201d",
      "European allies, for their part, argue that any security threats to Greenland should be handled together. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen will visit Norway, the U.K. and Sweden over the next five days, the ministry said Sunday, noting that the main topic will be the security situation in the Arctic.",
      "\u201cWhat our countries have in common is that we all agree that NATO\u2019s role in the Arctic must be strengthened, and I look forward to discussing how,\u201d a statement said.",
      "The president\u2019s latest threat has called into question the European strategy of \u201cbuttering up Mr. Trump,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News on Sunday, noting Trump\u2019s latest threats had escalated the situation from \u201cslingshot to bazooka.\u201d",
      "Even if European nations were able to come to some kind of agreement with Trump, he told NBC News, \u201che\u2019s well known for changing his mind or unleveling the playing field, and this is what they have to understand.\u201d",
      "Bociurkiw said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who announced lower tariffs with China last week after meeting with its leader Xi Jinping, had done the \u201csmart thing\u201d by going to Beijing and \u201crisking the ire of Mr. Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows that he\u2019s acting unilaterally,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way Europe needs to go.\u201d",
      "While Europe has trodden carefully with Trump in part to avoid upsetting negotiations over the war in Ukraine, his ultimatum over Greenland \u201cmakes no difference at all\u201d to that calculation, one analyst told NBC News, because \u201cnobody had any faith in the United States\u201d to deliver.",
      "\u201cThe confirmation that the U.S. does not have a common security vision with Europe doesn\u2019t change the position of Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThe threats and promises that we hear from Europeans warning the U.S. that this could mean the end of NATO are ineffective because this is not something which the current U.S. leadership group values,\u201d he added.",
      "The defense of Ukraine, he said, \u201crelies on Europe recognizing its responsibility, rather than any role the U.S. might previously have had.\u201d",
      "In a sign that the two disputes could end up entangled, however, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned Sunday that a U.S. invasion of Greenland \u201cwould make Vladimir Putin the happiest man in the world.\u201d"

      "That surveillance tallies with what Samira Mohyeddin, an Iranian-Canadian journalist, said she was told by a friend\u2019s daughter from the southern Mazandaran province.",
      "Posting a video on X of the conversation in Persian, Mohyeddin recounted that there was \u201cblood on the streets\u201d with drones and riot police maintaining order, and shops forced to close at 4 p.m. She said there had been no clashes in the past two days.",
      "The Iranian regime has decades of precedent for using violence to suppress its opponents, dating back to its foundation.",
      "In 1979, a popular revolution involving students and oil workers toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an autocratic ruler bolstered by a CIA-backed coup in 1953, and whose SAVAK secret police imprisoned and tortured opponents.",
      "But into that vacuum stepped not a democratic government, but a hard-line Shia theocracy headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.",
      "Throughout the 1980s, Khomeini\u2019s regime began what\u2019s now referred to as a reign of terror against his opponents. In 1988, at least 5,000 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared, executed and dumped in mass graves, according to Amnesty International and other human rights groups.",
      "Then, 2009 brought the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d when millions took to the streets in protest at the apparently rigged re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner. At least 72 people were killed and hundreds more injured, according to opposition figures.",
      "Street marches flared again in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the latter seeing 321 people killed by security forces after demonstrating against rising oil prices, according to Amnesty.",

She was accused of not adhering to the government\u2019s mandatory rules on headscarves for women and clothing restrictions.",

      "As Iran\u2019s national internet blackout stretches to its second week, the satellite internet service Starlink has become a crucial lifeline for many citizens to connect with the outside world \u2014 and one that the government appears to be trying to shut down.",
      "That\u2019s pushing some Iranians to get creative with how they use the service.",
      "In a video posted to Instagram and verified by NBC News, a man riding in the passenger seat of a car on an Iranian highway Tuesday said he had a Starlink device in the vehicle. He scrolls through his Instagram feed and visits speedtest.net, a popular site for testing internet connection speeds.",
      "\u201cYou are seeing it yourself,\u201d he says of Starlink\u2019s capabilities in the video, which NBC News translated from Farsi to English.",
      "As Iran\u2019s crackdown on communication continues, a game of cat and mouse has ensued, with Iran\u2019s government deploying new ways to halt or slow down Starlink connections, and activists and Starlink\u2019s parent company, Elon Musk\u2019s Space X, working to circumvent them.",
      "People opposed to the regime have been protesting in the streets across Iran for the last three weeks. The country\u2019s leadership cut off internet and phone access last week as protests and unrest gripped many parts of the country. It\u2019s a tactic that the Human Rights Watch says has helped the regime \u201cconceal widespread atrocities.\u201d",
      "According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the mass protests across the country. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",
      "Iran has also lobbied the United Nations' arm devoted to regulating communications technology, the International Telecommunication Union, to force SpaceX to stop operating in Iran. So far, the U.N. has not done so.",
      "The near-total ban on outside communication has left Starlink, widely regarded as the most cost-effective and high-speed commercially available option for satellite internet access, as the only choice for many Iranians.",
      "In a video that was circulated on social media, body bags are seen lined up at the Tehran Province Forensic Medicine Diagnostic and Laboratory Center in the city of Kahrizak. At one point, the man recording the video tells the person he is talking to on the phone, \u201cIf you get ahold of a Starlink anywhere in Iran, let me know.\u201d",
      "But its use does not come without its own risks.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cWe know, according to the law, using Starlink is a big crime,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, a refugee from Iran and the director of the Miaan Group, a nonprofit digital rights group focused on the Middle East. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t know if this might be another level of censorship.\u201d",
      "In addition to the ongoing total ban on international internet traffic, the government also initially blocked international phone calls and access to local networks that had stayed operational during previous blackouts, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that tracks internet connectivity.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most severe internet shutdowns we\u2019ve ever seen. Total internet shutdown, international calling blockage, sporadic domestic connectivity disconnections, for a country of 92 million people,\u201d Madory said.",
      "Since then, Starlink has become a hot commodity. While there is no official count of terminals in Iran, reliable estimates are in the tens of thousands, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that works to get Iranians online.",
      "Satellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out",
      "-Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of Holistic Resilience.",
      "Ahmadian said the Iranian government has been deploying \u201cjamming\u201d devices \u2014 a misnomer, as they do not fully disrupt Starlink terminals, but instead interfere with their traffic and can slow it down. That has somewhat been mitigated when Starlink forced an update to their terminals earlier this week, he said.",
      "\u201cSatellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out,\u201d he said.",
      "But that may change soon, Rashidi said, as Iran\u2019s government is actively working to improve its ability to invasively capture internet traffic as it travels to and from the satellites and identify the people using the devices.",
      "Starlink is fairly simple to use: A person just needs a small device called a terminal, which can connect to fleets of low-orbit satellites constantly circling the earth and provide a Wi-Fi signal to people nearby.",
      "But until this week, many terminals hadn\u2019t worked for many Iranians, Ahmadian said, as they usually require a paid subscription that often doesn\u2019t accept money from Iranian banks and credit cards. That changed when SpaceX suddenly waived the subscription fee for people in Iran, he said.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk, who regularly posts on X about Starlink, has not posted about it in relation to Iran, but earlier in the month boosted the company\u2019s post about providing free service to people in Venezuela through Feb. 3.",
      "Ahmadian said his group and others have worked for several years to smuggle Starlink terminals into the country, with a thriving black market for them.",
      "Iran\u2019s internet shutdown could last for months, Rashidi said, and getting terminals into the country is not easy. One activist group that has worked to get Starlink terminals into the country, NetFreedom Pioneers, showed how laborious the process can be.",
      "The group has raised nearly $50,000 on GoFundMe since June 2025, with recent donations surging alongside the protests. Though terminals generally range in cost from between $300 and $600, the group said in November that it had delivered 17 Starlink kits to people in Iran between June and September, at a cost of more than $18,000 to cover devices, subscriptions and the logistics to get them into the country.",
      "Most Iranians are unlikely to be able to afford the price tag \u2014  the rial currency plunged to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and euro. The country has also been crippled in recent years in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Online activists have also recently encouraged those in the U.S. to lobby their representatives to ask companies, including SpaceX, to enable direct-to-cell satellite internet to bypass the regime\u2019s blackout efforts."

Videos that have trickled out and circulated online offer a window into the resulting crackdown in the Islamic Republic and the methods employed by security forces to quell the unrest.",
      "The images, circulated on social media this week and geolocated by NBC News, show more than 200 bodies piled in the makeshift morgue outside the capital, machine guns fired at crowds, and clashes in cities from Urmia in the northwest to Isfahan in the heart of the country.",

      "In another, shots ring out near a police station as protesters can be heard chanting, \u201cDeath to Khamenei,\u201d a reference to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country. As the crowd chants largely out of sight, heavy automatic gunfire can be heard for 15 uninterrupted seconds.",
      "A group of security forces then comes into view from the right side of the screen and a member of the security forces aims and fires a pistol. A short while later, a person or body is dragged into the police station, though it is not clear who this person is. Several members of the security forces in riot gear on motorcycles then drive into the police station.",
      "About 5 miles south of the capital's southern suburbs, the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center has offered perhaps the clearest sign of the crackdown's intensity.",
      "Videos from the site, which became a makeshift morgue, first circulated over the weekend. Two more separate videos, which appear to have been shot by one person, circulated Tuesday.",
      "Outside the warehouse, the man filming the scene at Kahrizak walks up to a woman in a lab coat with a black headscarf who is writing in a notebook next to a man's blood-soaked body. The body has been partially removed from a black body bag placed on dirt.",
      "A man in a black T-shirt and black pants wearing gloves holds the body on its side and positions the bloody head for the medical official to get a better glimpse at the wound.",
      "\u201cWas he hit in the head?\u201d the person filming asks. Another man nearby replies: \u201cYes.\u201d",

It attaches a price tag of more than half the Defense Department\u2019s annual budget to Trump\u2019s national security priority, which has stoked anxiety across Europe and on Capitol Hill amid his rhetoric about seizing Greenland since he ordered a U.S. military raid to capture Venezuela\u2019s president and his wife.",

    "story": [
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 On a cold, foggy afternoon in downtown Copenhagen, military veteran Flemming Almind joined thousands of his fellow Danes in what he said was the first protest he\u2019s ever participated in, opposing the Trump administration\u2019s push to acquire Greenland.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve actually never done this before, demonstrating, but this is very important to me,\u201d Almind, 57, told NBC News. He said he had been following developments and felt \u201cI need to do something.\u201d",
      "An estimated 10,000 Danes gathered in the city hall square Saturday afternoon to express their frustration with President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric.",
      "The crowd, which included parents with small children as well as older Danes, wore hats in the style of Trump\u2019s MAGA caps but scrawled with \u201cMake America Go Away,\u201d and waved Greenlandic flags and signs saying, \u201cHands off Greenland.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to support Greenland,\u201d said protester Susanne Kristensen. \u201cWe are Danes, Greenland are Danes, even though they\u2019re Greenlanders, and we just have to stick together.\u201d",
      "Some protesters expressed fears that if they spoke out about Trump in the press or on social media, his administration could bar them from visiting the United States while he was in office. \u201cI won\u2019t go there until he\u2019s out,\u201d Kristensen said.",
      "The protest came just before Trump announced fresh tariffs on Denmark and its allies, a step that has infuriated European leaders and threatens to reignite a trade war that was meant to have been settled with a deal signed by Trump months ago.",
      "A bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, intending to express solidarity with the country in the face of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, was meanwhile wrapping up a visit to the Danish capital, where it met with the Danish prime minister and key Danish and Greenlandic officials.",
      "The visit by the group of 10 American lawmakers from both the House and Senate has not gone unnoticed, with the protesters saying they were closely following the developments. \u201cIt makes a huge difference that Congress members come here and listen,\u201d Kristime Due, who was attending the protest in Copenhagen, told NBC News.",
      "The delegation\u2019s visit was arranged on short notice and has played an almost counterprogramming role to the statements the Trump administration has been making. Trump\u2019s desire to own a part of the Danish kingdom is all over the airwaves in Danish news broadcasts, and Danes say it\u2019s a constant conversation.",
      "\u201cThis is a respectful and constructive delegation that came more to listen than to talk,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters on Saturday.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been made clear to us is that the people of Denmark are very anxious, are quite concerned, and the people of Greenland even more so,\u201d Coons said, adding that the current tone of statements from the White House is \u201cnot constructive.\u201d",
      "Coons said the delegation is \u201chaving active conversations amongst ourselves about what is the wisest course of action\u201d to de-escalate the rhetoric when they return to Washington, but some members of the delegation do not want to rush into a hasty symbolic vote that could fall along party lines.",
      "\u201cI worry that going to a specific legislative vehicle right now today is premature,\u201d Coons said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this to become a partisan matter. We simply cannot,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. \u201cI think the way that we keep it from being partisan is by full education, dismissing some of the assumptions that some may have and then acting together,\u201d she added.",
      "The members of Congress met with members of the Danish Parliament on Friday, with the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Flemming M\u00f8ller Mortensen, describing the discussion as \u201cfruitful\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel frightened,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cEspecially the people living in Greenland, both adults but also youngsters and kids, and that was also a part of what their Greenlandic colleagues [were] expressing today.\u201d",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, who is one of two Greenlandic representatives in the Danish Parliament, said that the \u201cuncertainty is really taking a toll\u201d on her people.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Chemnitz said. \u201cSo what is on the table for the U.S. side right now is not interesting for us, and you can\u2019t buy a country.\u201d",
      "Pipaluk Lynge, a member of the Greenlandic Parliament, traveled to Copenhagen to participate in the meeting.",
      "\u201cIt was really important for us to tell them from our own voice, because we know how it is back home,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe children are worried, the adults are not sleeping.\u201d",
      "Both sides stressed Denmark\u2019s willingness for more U.S. military presence in Greenland.",
      "The U.S. has one military base in the Arctic territory, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a small number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "While the Trump administration\u2019s push to take Greenland has started to fray the decades-old alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, some are concerned about the broader impact on NATO if it moves to seize an ally\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cIf the United States were to carry out any of the current threats against Greenland, it would sever NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
      "The Danes are keenly aware of how the alliance between the two countries has seen sacrifices in the past.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan and Iraq, Danes were actually serving alongside the American soldiers, and Denmark lost, per capita, a lot of soldiers,\u201d Almind, the military veteran, said at the protest in Copenhagen. \u201cLooking back, you have to ask yourself, was it all worth it?\u201d",
      "While Danes are hopeful that the U.S. delegation\u2019s support will resonate once they return to Washington, some are skeptical they can convince the president to change his mind when he seems determined to acquire Greenland at any cost.",
      "Danish protester Else Hatmann said the delegation contained \u201conly two [Republicans] who Trump don\u2019t even listen to.\u201d",
      "Murkowski, a frequent holdout who Trump earlier this month said \u201cshould never be elected to office again,\u201d pushed back against that sentiment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the absence of Republicans is because they don\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d",
      "The other Republican on the trip, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has become an outspoken critic of Trump since he announced he would not run for re-election, but avoided interacting with reporters during the press events the delegation held."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 One of the most popular new apps in China poses an awkward question: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d",
      "An app by that name has gone viral as a digital \u201ccheck-in\u201d aimed mainly at the growing number of young people living alone in China\u2019s sprawling cities. The idea is to designate an emergency contact person, who will be alerted if a user goes a few days without confirming their well-being on the app.",
      "The app, which was free when it launched last May but now costs 8 yuan ($1.14), was the most downloaded paid app in Apple\u2019s App Store for China in recent days - though after its viral popularity, it appears to have since disappeared from the Chinese App Store under unclear circumstances.",
      "The app describes itself as a personal safety assistant, \u201cwhether you are a professional living solo, a student studying far from home, or anyone choosing an independent lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Ian Guo, one of the founders, told NBC News he was surprised by the success of the app, which cost less than $150 to make and is now valued at around $15 million.",
      "He said he and his two co-founders, who like him are members of China\u2019s \u201cpost-95 generation,\u201d were inspired by social media commenters who said this was something they needed.",
      "\u201cWe saw this opportunity and asked ourselves if we could quickly launch a product,\u201d Guo said. But they also believed the app \u201ccould truly provide people with more security and protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally lived alone in Shenzhen for a long time, so I understand the various problems one faces when living solo,\u201d he said, adding that the sense of loneliness and insecurity \u201cis constant.\u201d",
      "Though the concept may sound morbid, the app\u2019s popularity is a reflection of demographic changes in China, where urbanization, falling marriage rates and long work hours have left many feeling isolated.",
      "By 2030, China \u2014 a nation of 1.4 billion people \u2014 could have 200 million one-person households, according to the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which cited real estate research institutions.",
      "The app\u2019s name in Mandarin, \u201cSi Le Ma,\u201d appeared to be a play on the name of one of China\u2019s most popular food delivery apps, \u201cE Le Ma,\u201d which means \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d Some found its emphasis on death too dark, and the app has now been renamed Demumu, which Guo said was \u201ccuter.\u201d",
      "\"\u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 sounds more like a joke,\" says Lisa Li, a 23 year old English teacher, \"But Are You Alive? sounds like you\u2019re rising from the dead and that would be even weirder.\"",
      "Li, 23, said she found the app \u201ca bit absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be afraid that if I were forgetful and missed a check-in, people would actually think I\u2019m dead,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she thought most people were downloading the app out of curiosity. \u201cSome people really do worry that if they die, no one will find them,\u201d she added, pointing to a recent string of highly publicized cases of young Chinese professionals, particularly at tech companies, dying suddenly after long periods of intense work.",
      "Cui Xiyue, an exhibition planner in Beijing, said she downloaded the app when she was \u201cgoing through a period of depression and mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust getting through a single day back then wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Cui, 23.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got it, I checked in every day, but I didn\u2019t stick with it for very long,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need it anymore because I\u2019ve stopped thinking about those dark things.\u201d",
      "Loneliness has long been a concern for older people in China, where more than one-fifth of the population is over 60. When younger family members migrate from rural areas to cities, they are often left behind.",
      "But social isolation is also a problem for young Chinese, who are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children amid the rising cost of living and competition for jobs.",
      "Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said she thought the app would be helpful for young people living alone.",
      "\u201cOf course, to some extent they are joking, it\u2019s more sarcastic,\u201d said Tong, co-director of the university\u2019s Centre for Chinese Family Studies. On the other hand, she said, the app could lead people to reflect on their single life.",
      "Some commenters on Chinese social media were skeptical of the app\u2019s usefulness.",
      "\u201cDo people really use apps like this? If I get busy and forget to check in, wouldn\u2019t I end up \u2018dying\u2019 every other day?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",
      "Others rejected the idea of having yet another place to report to.",
      "\u201cYou have to clock in for school, clock in for work, and now you have to clock in just to prove you aren\u2019t dead,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cChinese people \u2014 spending a lifetime \u2018clocking in.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tong said loneliness was less of a problem for young people than for older people because they are \u201cmore adaptive\u201d when it comes to using the internet to connect with the outside world.",
      "\u201cSome of the activities can be transferred offline,\u201d she said, pointing to the thousands of people who showed up in a village outside the Chinese city of Chongqing to help a young woman and her father slaughter pigs for a traditional banquet after she posted a callout last week on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.",
      "\u201cYoung people can find a way to overcome their own loneliness,\u201d Tong said, \u201cif they\u2019re really willing to.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 It has been a familiar sight over the past decade: Prince Harry on the steps of a British courthouse for the latest round of his battle with a tabloid newspaper.",
      "But if, as expected, he arrives at London\u2019s High Court again on Monday, it could be the final time he takes on the British press, which he has accused of bullying and harassment and has blamed for the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. And some royal watchers say the end of his legal campaign could pave the way for a reconciliation with his father, King Charles III.",
      "\u201cWe know that Harry\u2019s various legal issues and trials have been the primary cause of the breakdown in the relationship between Charles and Harry,\u201d NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI think a lot of people within the royal family and outside will be hoping that once these court battles are over, Harry can turn his attention to reconciling with his family,\u201d she added.",
      "This time around, Harry will be joined by Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, actors Sadie Frost and Elizabeth Hurley and former lawmaker Simon Hughes in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.",
      "Baroness Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, will also join the claimants. Her inclusion has been seen by some as significant because the Daily Mail campaigned for a long time to bring her son\u2019s killers to justice, famously naming five people as his murderers on its front page. When two of the men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were eventually convicted, the paper was praised for its coverage.",
      "The group\u2019s lawyers have accused ANL of \u201cgrave breaches of privacy\u201d and alleged that the newspaper group commissioned private investigators to unlawfully target their clients, tapped and hacked their phones, and obtained private medical and financial records through deception, chiefly between 1993 and 2011.",
      "Associated Newspapers Limited has strenuously denied the allegations. Asked for comment ahead of the trial on Thursday, the company referred NBC News to a previous statement issued in 2024 that called the claims \u201cpreposterous and without foundation.\u201d It added that its defense submission said \u201cthe case brought by the Prince and others is \u2018an affront to the hard-working journalists whose reputations and integrity, as well as those of Associated itself, are wrongly traduced.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike Lawrence, Harry is no stranger to this kind of litigation, having successfully sued Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in 2023 and last year receiving \u201csubstantial damages\u201d and an apology after settling a claim against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun.",
      "Both companies have paid out tens of millions of dollars to multiple claimants including celebrities, politicians and ordinary people after it emerged that some of their journalists and private investigators employed by their newspapers were hacking into phones and intercepting voicemails in the early 2000s.",
      "Until now, however, Associated Newspapers Limited has not been sued for phone hacking, which, if proved, \u201cwill reshape the story of modern British journalism,\u201d according to media lawyer Mark Stephens.",
      "\u201cHarry and his team characterize this as the last major test of the untouchable corner of the British press,\u201d Stephens, who works at the London-based law firm Howard Kennedy LLP, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cIt asks whether a major U.K. publisher has been operating in the shadows or is genuinely clean,\u201d he added, referring to the fact that allegations of this nature have not been made against the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday before.",
      "The claimants, he said, will be relying on a \u201cmosaic of inferences\u201d that, in their totality, will need to demonstrate that \u201cmore probably than not\u201d phone hacking and unlawful information gathering did occur.",
      "It is unlikely that a settlement will be reached before the start of the trial, he said. \u201cI think if it was going to settle, it would have done so by now,\u201d he added. \u201cNo newspaper will want to have the scrutiny of this and would have settled if they thought they didn\u2019t have a decent case.\u201d",
      "Whatever the outcome, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Emily Nash said that once he ends his legal battles, Harry might be able to patch up relations with his family, which became strained after he quit front-line royal duties in 2020, along with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, before they moved to California.",
      "\u201cMembers of the royal family traditionally use the maxim \u2018Never complain, never explain,\u2019 but they do pursue legal action if they feel they\u2019ve been wronged,\u201d she said in a video call Monday. \u201cWhat they tend to do, though, is do it in a far more low-key manner,\u201d she added. \u201cThey will settle out of court rather than have their personal information brought up in a public domain.\u201d",
      "Another source of contention has been Harry\u2019s legal battle to have his police protection reinstated when he visits the U.K. The decision to strip him of publicly funded protection was made by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known by the acronym RAVEC, which approves security for the royals and VIPs, such as the prime minister.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After he lost a legal challenge to that ruling in May, Harry told the BBC that it was not safe to bring his family back to the U.K. because he could not guarantee their protection.",
      "His father would not speak to him \u201cbecause of this security stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d",
      "Harry, who is expected to testify on Thursday, met with Charles for the first time in 19 months in September, and if he does come to London for the case, it is unlikely they will reconcile, as Charles will be in Scotland for his traditional post-Christmas stay, which typically lasts for most of January.",
      "Either way, it is unclear what will be required for the pair to patch things up, according to McAndrew, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor.",
      "Harry\u2019s brother, Prince William, and Charles \u201cwill want some sort of guarantees that Harry will stop talking, ironically, to the press or writing books or doing documentaries and putting his side of the story out there in a way that impacts and sometimes detrimentally harms the rest of the royal family,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cI think it is a really big problem,\u201d Ina Tommerup said as she was leaving the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. President Donald Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really care,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he thinks Denmark is really small, which is true, but we also have a lot of alliances.\u201d",

      "Trump first floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in 2019 during his first term but, in recent weeks, he has vowed to take control of the island \u201cone way or the other,\u201d citing concerns it could be vulnerable to Russia or China. The White House has refused to rule out military action to seize the island from Denmark, alarming allies and rattling the NATO alliance, which has protected the Western world since World War II.",

      "In the unlikely event of that changing, Rasmus Sinding S\u00f8ndergaard, a senior researcher, at the Danish Institute for International Studies, a Copenhagen-based think tank, said it was \u201cimportant to emphasize that Denmark does not legally have the option to sell Greenland, because we don\u2019t own Greenland.\u201d",
      "Any financial acquisition of Greenland would need congressional authorization and both Republicans and Democrats have shown little interest in providing the funding for such a purchase.",

      "Lawmakers on both sides of the House have said they would back legislation to rein in Trump\u2019s ability to seize Greenland, as the fight goes on over war powers, which the Constitution grants to Congress.

That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies.",

      "Carney\u2019s trip follows years of frosty relations over Beijing\u2019s lengthy detention of two Canadians regarded as hostages as well as allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian politics.",

      "As part of an effort to \u201crecalibrate\u201d the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.",
      "It\u2019s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff.",
      "Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free.",
      "During their meeting earlier Friday, Xi told Carney that China was willing to strengthen coordination \u201cto jointly address global challenges.\u201d",
      "Carney, who called China his country\u2019s biggest security threat while campaigning for office last year, said Friday that the global security landscape \u201ccontinues to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn a world that\u2019s more dangerous and divided, we face many threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Though Canada\u2019s relationship with the U.S. is much deeper and broader, Carney said, ties with China were now \u201cmore predictable.\u201d",
      "A 'tough spot' for Canada",
      "Canada-China relations went into a \u201cdeep freeze\u201d in 2018 when China arrested the two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, said Lynette Ong, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto.",
      "Their detention came days after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, an executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei, at the request of U.S. officials seeking her extradition on fraud charges. Kovrig and Spavor, who were accused of spying, spent almost three years in Chinese detention before being released in 2021, hours after Meng made a deal with the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cEven after the two Michaels were released, people did not warm up to China at all,\u201d Ong said.",
      "Then Trump returned to the White House last January.",
      "Within days, he imposed a 25% tariff on most Canadian goods and started talking about making Canada, a nation of 40 million people, the 51st U.S. state.",
      "U.S.-Canada trade talks have been on hold since October, when Trump cut them off in anger over an anti-tariff ad produced by the Ontario government.",

      "An equal proportion of respondents had a favorable opinion of America, down from 54%.",
      "Though the same pattern can be seen in a number of countries around the world, in Canada \u201cthe flip is especially obvious,\u201d Ong said.",
      "Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years.",
      "\u201cFurther trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,\u201d Ong said.",
      "About 75% of Canada\u2019s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.",
      "Though Canada is seeking to increase exports to a number of countries \u2014 including India, where Carney has also been trying to improve strained relations \u2014 a major priority is China, where imports of Canadian goods fell more than 10% last year, according to Chinese customs data released Wednesday.",
      "The two countries made a major step forward in October when the leaders met on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, where Xi invited Carney to Beijing.",
      "The speed with which Carney went to China \u201creflects a sense of urgency,\u201d said Saint-Jacques, the former ambassador. \u201cHe knows that Canada is in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "Showing the U.S. that Canada has other options for its exports, he said, could put Carney in a stronger position as the U.S., Canada and Mexico begin a \u201cjoint review\u201d of their free trade agreement, known as the USMCA. Trump this week dismissed the agreement, which he praised when it was announced during his first term, as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d",
      "At the same time, \u201cCanadians know also that China is a very difficult partner,\u201d Saint-Jacques said. \u201cWe know very well how they can contravene international rules.\u201d",

      "Like the U.S., Canada has no official ties with Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, but supports it in the face of Chinese pressure.",
      "Carney said Friday that he had raised human rights issues such as last month\u2019s conviction of Hong Kong democracy activist Jimmy Lai.",
      "But he added: \u201cWe take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.\u201d",

      "\u201cI follow what credible social media accounts report and cling to that \u2014 nothing else,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does this process even stand?\u201d",
      "Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez vowed to continue releasing prisoners at a news briefing Wednesday, saying the government was entering a \u201cnew political moment.\u201d",
      "She said the process of releasing hundreds of detainees \u201chas not yet concluded.\u201d",
      "Venezuela\u2019s government said Monday that 166 prisoners had been released but did not provide a list of names or evidence. On Tuesday, the head of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, said more than 400 people had been freed, but that figure includes two rounds of releases carried out before the U.S. captured Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3.",
      "Human rights groups dispute those numbers. Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "The State Department announced Tuesday that multiple Americans who were detained in Venezuela have been released. Several detainees with Spanish citizenship were also let go last week.",
      "Diego Casanova, spokesperson for the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, told NBC News that members of the group have gone to prisons around the country to wait for releases. He said anxiety has increased because unofficial lists of political prisoners and names have been circulating, but so far nothing has been confirmed.",
      "\u201cIf only partial releases occur, this means that the repressive policy continues. All these people will remain unjustly detained, which is why we have insisted on the full and immediate release of all political prisoners,\u201d he said.",
      "Even after they are released, former political prisoners aren\u2019t fully free, Casanova said. They aren\u2019t viewed as political prisoners by the government and instead are seen as \u201cpoliticians who have broken the law and called for invasion,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a recent address.",
      "For example, they must periodically appear before a court to show that they are in the country and have complied with orders.",
      "\u201cThe judicial process remains open, which is very unjust because the crimes they are charged with are lies,\u201d Casanova said.",
      "The interim government is intensifying its crackdown on citizens, looking for signs of support for Maduro\u2019s capture. Fifteen minors and two 18-year-olds were arrested last week in Barcelona, in Anzo\u00e1tegui state, for allegedly celebrating the U.S. operation. Within 48 hours, they were taken before a court, where the judge ordered all to remain in custody.",
      "The 15 were released Tuesday following sustained pressure from their parents and neighbors. But the two 18-year-olds remain detained.",
      "Meanwhile, contacts between President Donald Trump and the Venezuelan leadership are ongoing.",
      "Trump spoke Wednesday with Rodr\u00edguez, and both described the call as positive.",
      "\u201cWe just had a great conversation today, and she\u2019s a terrific person,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting along very well with Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Machado met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, after he dismissed her capacity to run the country. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice woman, but she doesn\u2019t have the respect within the country. ... I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\u201d Trump said at a news conference Jan.3 following the U.S. military operation that captured Maduro.",
      "Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom the U.S. recognized as the winner of last year\u2019s presidential election, have also raised concerns about irregularities in the recent prisoner releases.",
      "\u201cOur message to the regime, Venezuela, and the international community is unambiguous: genuine democratic transition is impossible while political prisoners remain behind bars, and Venezuela cannot be truly free as long as anyone faces persecution for their political beliefs.\u201d they said in a statement released Tuesday.",
      "They also denounced the death of Edilson Torres on Saturday in prison, where he was held incommunicado. The family of Torres, a police official, had been waiting for his release when he died of a heart attack. He was jailed in December for criticizing the government through WhatsApp messages. According to Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, it is the eighth death in state custody since the 2024 elections."
