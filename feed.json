      "Olivia Hussey, the actor who starred as a teenage Juliet in the 1968 film \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d has died, her family said on social media",
      "LONDON -- Olivia Hussey, the actor who starred as a teenage Juliet in the 1968 film \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d has died, her family said on social media Saturday. She was 73.",
      "Hussey died on Friday, \u201cpeacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones,\u201d a statement posted to her Instagram account said.",
      "Hussey was 15 when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her in his adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy after spotting her onstage in the play \u201cThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,\" which also starred Vanessa Redgrave.",
      "\u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d won two Oscars and Hussey won a Golden Globe for best new actress for her part as Juliet, opposite British actor Leonard Whiting, who was 16 at the time.",
      "Decades later Hussey and Whiting brought a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud over nude scenes in the film.",
      "They alleged that they were initially told they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in a bedroom scene, but on the day of the shoot Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity. They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge.",
      "The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late.",
      "Hussey was born on April 17, 1951, in Bueno Aires, Argentina, and moved to London as a child.",
      "She also starred as Mary, mother of Jesus, in the 1977 television series \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\" and in the 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cDeath on the Nile.\u201d",
      "She is survived by her husband, David Glen Eisley, her three children and a grandson.",

    "story": [
      "A retrospective exhibition in South Africa is honoring Esther Mahlangu, a local artist from a rural background who has become internationally known for her colorful work in traditional Ndebele painting",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- A boldly patterned BMW stands at the entrance of the Wits Arts Museum in the vibrant Johannesburg neighborhood of Braamfontein.",
      "Its bright geometric shapes are part of 89-year-old South African artist Esther Mahlangu \u2019s unmistakable style. The car is the centerpiece of an exhibition honoring her and her work.",
      "The BMW, commissioned by the German manufacturer in 1991, is among Mahlangu\u2019s most well-known works and has been returned to South Africa this year after more than 30 years abroad.",
      "Exhibition curator Nontobeko Ntombela also has included pieces that document the struggles of Nelson Mandela, who was released after almost three decades in prison and became South Africa's first Black president when the country transitioned from white minority rule to democracy in 1994.",
      "These include a letter Mahlangu wrote to Mandela thanking him for the sacrifices he made for the country.",
      "She is respected for persevering with art at a time when Black artists, especially women, were hardly acknowledged.",
      "\u201cMahlangu dared to travel an uncharted path during a time when Black women artists were systemically overlooked. I hope when people see just how much she has done, they will realize the magnitude of what she has offered to the arts,\u201d Ntombela said.",
      "The retrospective also includes a documentary about the artist, where she tells the story of her rural upbringing and her Ndebele culture.",
      "For decades, Mahlangu has used her talent to promote that culture, becoming arguably the southern African ethnic group's most recognized representative.",
      "Ntombela said much of the publicly available information about Mahlangu tends to repeat the same narratives, including her first international show in Paris in 1989.",
      "\u201cSome tend to overly emphasize the culture without the balance of discussing her work as an art form. The exhibition tries to complicate this and hopefully offers an opportunity of how her art moves across these different fields and disciplines,\" the curator said.",
      "Some of the artworks showing umgwalo, or traditional Ndebele painting, were borrowed from collections locally and abroad. Ntombela said it took about two years to secure them.",
      "\u201cNumerous works are under the ownership of international collectors, so we needed a lot of funds to bring a lot of her work back to South Africa,\u201d she said.",
      "Mahlangu is a recipient of one of South Africa's highest national awards, the Order of Ikhamanga in silver, which is awarded by the head of state.",
      "She briefly attended the launch of the exhibition last month but lives quietly in Mpumalanga province, where her colorfully decorated home remains an attraction for local and international tourists.",
      "The exhibition will run until April 17 before it embarks on an international tour starting in the United States in early 2026."

    "story": [
      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "When Snoop Dogg agreed to become the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl, he had a demand: It must have a NIL component",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The four-story building, which has been vacant more than a decade, burned for nearly two hours before more than 100 firefighters brought the flames under control, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "The Morrison Hotel was featured on the cover of The Doors' fifth album. Celebrated music photographer Henry Diltz made the image in 1969 and said years later that it took a little trickery to pull it off.",
      "A hotel clerk told the band they weren't allowed to take photos inside, but when the clerk stepped away, the group ran into the lobby and Diltz quickly got the photo looking through the window, with legendary frontman Jim Morrison in the middle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great old wooden building with many small rooms upstairs where transients and drinkers could sleep it off on a cot for $2.50 a night!\" Diltz told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I think the beautiful front window with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in red letters was the best part of it! So did The Doors!\u201d",
      "The album was viewed as a comeback to their roots for The Doors, coming on the heels of Morrison's on-stage arrest at a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity.",

      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",

      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",

      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

      "Netflix\u2019s 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries could stream the games, marking the first time one outlet distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix had the games available in five languages \u2014 English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.",
      "Netflix had problems streaming the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight on Nov. 14. The bout peaked at 65 million concurrent streams, including 38 million concurrent streams in the United States. According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to and during the fight.",
      "There were fewer complaints on Wednesday.",
      "According to NFL Media, viewers in all 50 states tuned in within minutes of the pregame show going live and viewers from nearly 200 countries watched the first game. Before the Ravens-Texans kicked off, Netflix reported that it eclipsed its peak concurrent viewers of any Christmas in the past four years.",
      "The NFL was playing its first games on a Wednesday since the Steelers and Ravens were forced to play on Dec. 2, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The only other time the league played on a Wednesday since 1948 was in 2012 when the Giants and Cowboys met in the season opener.",
      "Netflix promoted its own programming in addition to the usual slew of advertisements. The first teaser trailer for \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u201d was released before kickoff. Adam Sandler is back as Happy Gilmore for the sports comedy that hits the streaming service in 2025. Travis Kelce also was featured in a trailer filled with cameos by celebrities, including Bad Bunny and Kid Cudi.",
      "The NFL played its first games on Christmas Day in 1971 with a pair of divisional playoff games. The league avoided playing on Dec. 25 from 1972-88 and shifted its full slate of games to Saturday if Christmas fell on a Sunday. Since 1989, there have been 30 games on Christmas, never more than three on that day. But the NFL went out of its way to schedule two games on Wednesday to accommodate its $150 million deal with Netflix.",

      "Hitmaking record producer Richard Perry has died at 82",
      "Richard Perry, a hitmaking record producer with a flair for both standards and contemporary sounds whose many successes included Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d series and a Ringo Starr album featuring all four Beatles, died Tuesday. He was 82.",
      "Perry, a recipient of a Grammys Trustee Award in 2015, died at a Los Angeles hospital after suffering cardiac arrest, friend Daphna Kastner said.",
      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",
      "Perry was a onetime drummer, oboist and doo-wop singer who proved at home with a wide variety of musical styles, the rare producer to have No. 1 hits on the pop, R&B, dance and country charts. He was on hand for Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d and The Pointer Sisters' \u201cI\u2019m So Excited,\u201d Tiny Tim\u2019s novelty smash \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d and the Willie Nelson-Julio Iglesias lounge standard \u201cTo All the Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Perry was widely known as a \u201cmusician\u2019s producer,\u201d treating artists like peers rather than vehicles for his own tastes. Singers turned to him whether trying to update their sound (Barbra Streisand), set back the clock (Stewart), revive their career (Fats Domino) or fulfill early promise (Leo Sayer).",
      "\u201cRichard had a knack for matching the right song to the right artist,\u201d Streisand wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s life was a story, in part, of famous friends and the right places. He was backstage for 1950s performances by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, sat in the third row at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival during Otis Redding\u2019s memorable set and attended a recording session for the Rolling Stones\u2019 classic \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d album. A given week might find him dining one night with Paul and Linda McCartney, and Mick and Bianca Jagger the next. He dated Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda among others and was briefly married to the actor Rebecca Broussard.",
      "In Stewart's autobiography, \u201cRod,\u201d he would remember Perry's home in West Hollywood as \u201cthe scene of much late-night skulduggery through the 1970s and beyond, and a place you knew you could always fall into at the end of an evening for a full-blown knees-up with drink and music and dancing.\u201d",
      "In the '70s, Perry helped facilitate a near-Beatles reunion.",
      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",
      "\u201cShe had a number of issues that went unaddressed and found coping mechanisms to get through life,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cI think a lot of people are undiagnosed with things and just make do. Maybe she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fear,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was the fear that I focused on the most. She attacks before anyone can attack her, and she thinks everyone is attacking her.\u201d",
      "But Pansy\u2019s specific diagnosis isn\u2019t the point of \u201cHard Truths.\u201d It's much more about how her family and the outside world react to her. She might be pushing everyone away, but it's clear she's in urgent need of something.",
      "\u201cI want so desperately for someone to help Pansy,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think it would be very convenient to go, \u2018She\u2019s got this mental illness or that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her.\u2019 But what\u2019s more interesting is that we don\u2019t actually know and she\u2019s just in pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d ultimately ends in a kind of cliffhanger, with Pansy and her family locked in stasis. If Pansy tests the boundaries of empathy an audience might feel for a character, it's a moment of truth: Does Pansy go to her husband or refuse to budge? Jean-Baptiste wants to believe in her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she goes, I do, because I like her,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI like Pansy. I gotta look out for her.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",
      "Director Alex Timbers first approached Rich, the son of noted critic Frank Rich, with the idea of transferring some of his short stories to the stage.",
      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",
      "The audience at the Hudson Theatre during one recent performance was notably younger than for most Broadway shows and Mulaney and Rich hope they can do some theatrical recruitment with \u201cAll In.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we are finding that there are some first-time theatergoers or new theater goers that are coming and we\u2019re thrilled by that,\u201d says Rich. \u201cWe hope that comedy fans will enjoy this experience and that it\u2019ll help convert them into theater fans and maybe they\u2019ll see this show and want to check out more.\u201d"

      "\u201cIncluding promotion, I'd been living with Gi-hun for about two years,\" said Lee in a recent interview. \u201cI really felt like I was him,\" he said in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",

Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",

If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast.

      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",

It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",

The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.",
      "Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",
      "Family films like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cSonic 3\u201d have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26% of this year's box office.",
      "\u201cThe box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",

      "Even with abortion bans in place in most Republican-controlled states, the number of people obtaining them has grown slightly",
      "Abortion has become slightly more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.",
      "It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.",
      "The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "Here's a look at data on where things stand:",
      "Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the U.S.",
      "But one thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.",
      "There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.",
      "\u201cAbortion bans don\u2019t actually prevent abortions from happening,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "But, she said, they do change care.",
      "For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions \u2014 and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.",
      "For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.",
      "As the bans swept in, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.",
      "They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it\u2019s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.",
      "But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions was via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.",
      "This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.",
      "Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.",
      "But a network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortion in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.",
      "Abortion funds, which benefitted from \u201crage giving\u201d in 2022, have helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.",
      "Since the downfall of Roe, the actions of lawmakers and courts have kept shifting where abortion is legal and under what conditions.",
      "Here's where it stands now:",
      "Florida, the nation\u2019s second most-populous state, began enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy on May 1.",
      "That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortion to an exporter of people looking for them.",
      "There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.",
      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the first severe case of the illness in the United States",
      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation\u2019s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week.",
      "Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans \u2014 something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm.",
      "Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work.",
      "\u201cIs this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cRight now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn\u2019t open the door.\u201d",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms.",
      "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month.",
      "The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were \u201cconcerning,\u201d but the risk to the general public from the outbreak \u201chas not changed and remains low.\u201d",
      "Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what\u2019s happening with mutations carefully.",
      "\u201cThere will be additional influenza pandemics and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,\" he said. \"We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don\u2019t know what time it is.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon house cat died after eating pet food that tested positive for bird flu, Oregon authorities said, prompting a recall of raw frozen pet food that was sold nationwide.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\u201d Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cThis cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\u201d",
      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden has signed the annual defense authorization bill into law despite his objections to language banning transgender health care for military children",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law a defense bill that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion despite his objections to language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children in military families.",
      "Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents\u2019 roles to determine the best care for their children.\u201d He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",
      "\u201cNo service member should have to decide between their family\u2019s health care access and their call to serve our nation,\u201d the president said in a statement.",
      "The Senate forwarded the bill to Biden after passing it last week by a vote of 85-14. In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.",
      "Biden also objected to other language in the bill prohibiting the use of money earmarked to transfer detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to some foreign countries and into the United States. He urged Congress to lift those restrictions.",
      "The annual defense authorization bill, which directs Pentagon policy, provides a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others.",
      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.",
      "The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.",
      "The legislation still must be backed up with a spending package.",

    "story": [
      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",
      "During his campaign, Trump flip-flopped on abortion policy and at points attempted to distance himself from abortion opponents. Since he won the election, though, he has nominated abortion opponents to administration posts.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published this month, he gave rambling answers to questions about pills. He said he intended to maintain access but also left the door open to changing his mind.",

      "",
      "\"People are getting it right more often when they hear the neutral [version],\" Wesevich told MedPage Today. \"It's pretty compelling that there's some sort of distraction or cognitive effect of having to neutralize out the biased phrases.\"",
      "",
      "In an invited commentary, Somnath Saha, MD, MPH, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the effect of biased language on information recall \"intriguing.\"",
      "",
      "\"At first glance, it seems that this effect might be a matter of simple distraction,\" they wrote. \"The human brain has finite capacity for retaining information, and the addition of clinically uninformative details might have crowded out information that was clinically important.\"",
      "",
      "The findings suggest that \"by engendering more negative attitudes toward the patient,\" they added, \"stigmatizing language may lessen the clinician's investment in the patient's well-being and thereby reduce the clinician's motivation to retain the information needed to provide optimal care for the patient.\"",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues surveyed 169 residents and medical students (56% female, mean age 28.6), each of whom heard three recorded handoffs, which were a combination of neutral and biased. The biased handoffs were one of three types  --  stereotype, blame, or doubt  --  and they all came from a previous study by Wesevich's group.",
      "",
      "That study involved recording residents doing handoffs, and it found that biased phrases were more common in notes about patients who were Black or obese. While they changed small details to protect patient identity, the biased handoffs are largely true to the words used in the recorded handoffs in the earlier study, Wesevich told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

      "\u201cAll of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,\u201d the presidential administration said in a statement, using wording familiar from a series of previous group pardons in the past six months.",
      "Saturday\u2019s announcement marks the eighth such pardon by Lukashenko since the summer of 2024. In all, 207 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarus\u2019 oldest and most established human rights group, Viasna.",

      "Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom says it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debt by the east European country",
      "Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom said Saturday it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debt by the European Union candidate country, which has brought in emergency measures as it braces for power cuts.",
      "Gazprom said in an online statement that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz, Moldova's main gas operator, in which the Russian company owns a majority stake. The cessation of gas will stop supplies to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region.",
      "Moldova reacted by accusing Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "Gazprom supplies the gas-operated Kuciurgan plant, which generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper. The plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company. Moldova, which has a West-leaning central government and has repeatedly complained of Russian interference, doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization.",
      "Earlier this month, Moldova's parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector over fears that Russia could leave Moldova without sufficient energy this winter.",
      "A special commission was also set up to manage \u201cimminent risks\u201d if Moscow fails to supply gas to the Kuciurgan plant and on Friday approved a series of measures aimed at saving energy.",

      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean on Saturday condemned the move, saying that his government does not recognize the debt cited by Gazprom, which has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "Moldova claims, citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, that its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a small fraction of that claimed by Gazprom.",
      "Recean added that Chisinau has pushed to diversify its natural gas supplies to reduce dependence on the Kuciurgan plant, and said the government will \u201ccarefully analyze legal options, including resorting to international arbitration\u201d to protect Moldova\u2019s national interests.",
      "\u201cOur country is prepared to handle any situation that arises following the Kremlin\u2019s decision,\u201d he said.",
      "Moldova\u2019s government on Friday announced it would implement a series of measures starting Jan. 1 to reduce energy consumption. These include limiting lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "In late 2022, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on neighboring Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, in case the region does not receive gas supplies.",
      "When Russia fully invaded Ukraine in 2022, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.5 million people, was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources.",
      "In October, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western President Maia Sandu won a second term in office, and a referendum voted in favor of securing the country\u2019s path toward the EU, in two votes overshadowed by ongoing claims of Russian interference to derail the country\u2019s westward shift in recent years. Russia denies it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Russia cut off most natural gas supplies to Europe in 2022, citing disputes over payment in rubles, a move European leaders described as energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "European governments had to scramble to line up alternative supplies at higher prices, much of it liquefied natural gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar.",

That is in addition to another 15 acres (60,700 square meters) of land needed for building graveyards for regular use in Goteborg.",
      "\u201dThe (recommendations) mean that we need more land for burial grounds and this is a phenomenon in the big cities, and a problem in the big cities, where land resources are scarce to begin with and not always sufficient to meet burial ground needs even in times of calm and peace,\u201d said Katarina Evenseth, senior advisor at the Goteborg Burial Association.",
      "Together with the local municipality, which has a monopoly in making decisions about land usage in Goteborg, the burial association has identified a vast area appropriate for building a large-scale cemetery for the intended purpose.",
      "But a lengthy approval and building process means it could take approximately 10 years to complete, posing further challenges in uncertain times.",
      "Meanwhile, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) continues to stress the importance of crisis preparedness and highlights the efforts of the Church of Sweden.",
      "\u201dAlready back in 2015 the Government assigned various authorities to once again start engaging in civil defense planning, and many organizations have started planning, with the Church of Sweden being at the forefront of that planning,\u201d said Jan-Olof Olsson, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) expert at MSB.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately it is the case that we are reminded to a greater degree that war could happen and that we simply need to be prepared for that,\u201d Olsson said.",
      "Sweden pursued a policy of neutrality from the early 19th Century, including during World War II.",
      "But public opinion shifted sharply in 2022 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to Sweden and Finland applying to join the transatlantic alliance out of concern about the threat from their newly aggressive Russian neighbor across the Baltic Sea.",
      "Sweden and Finland sent out updated civil preparedness guides in November with instructions on how to survive in war. The guides are similar to those in Denmark and Norway, though they don't mention Russia by name."

The announcement comes a day after Israeli troops stormed the hospital, forcing many staff and patients outside to strip in winter weather, according to the ministry.",
      "Israel\u2019s army didn\u2019t respond to questions about Dr. Abu Safiya. On Friday, it denied claims it had entered or set fire to the complex and said it was conducting operations against Hamas infrastructure and militants in the area and had ordered people out of the hospital.",
      "It repeated claims that Hamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan Hospital but provided no evidence. Hospital officials have denied that.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli troops waging an offensive against Hamas fighters in surrounding neighborhoods. The ministry said a strike on the hospital earlier this week killed five medical personnel.",
      "Israel\u2019s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives has devastated Gaza\u2019s health sector. The war has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, more than half women and children, and wounded more than 108,000 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",
      "Dr. Abu Safiya was detained Friday along with dozens of other staff from the hospital and taken to an interrogation center, the ministry said.",
      "On Friday, MedGlobal, the humanitarian organization where Dr. Abu Safiya worked, said he was a lead physician for the group and was gravely concerned about him. The group said the incident follows the October detention of five other of its staff, calling it an \u201calarming and egregious pattern of targeting medical personnel and spaces.\"",
      "Since October, Israel\u2019s offensive has virtually sealed off the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and leveled large parts of them. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced out but thousands are believed to remain in the area where Kamal Adwan and two other hospitals are located.",
      "Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which they killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third believed to be dead.",
      "On Saturday, Israel continued attacks across Gaza. An overnight strike killed at least nine people in Maghazi, including women and children, according to an Associated Press reporter who saw the bodies and staff at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where they were taken.",
      "Israel said its troops had also begun operating in the northern city of Beit Hanoun, following intelligence that fighters and Hamas infrastructure were in the area.",
      "Strikes also continued into Israel. Early Saturday morning, air raid sirens once again awoke Israelis and the military said it intercepted a missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels.",
      "Israeli warplanes bombed key infrastructure in Yemen again on Thursday. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and say they won't stop until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",

      "Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister widely regarded as the architect of the country\u2019s economic reform program, has been cremated after a state funeral",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister widely regarded as the architect of the country\u2019s economic reform program, was cremated after a state funeral on Saturday as politicians and the public mourned his death.",
      "The veteran leader, who was also credited for a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, died late Thursday at age 92.",
      "Singh\u2019s body was taken Saturday morning to the headquarters of his Congress party in New Delhi, where party leaders and activists paid tributes to him and chanted \u201cManmohan Singh lives forever.\u201d",
      "Abhishek Bishnoi, a party leader, said Singh's death was big loss for the country. \u201cHe used to speak little, but his talent and his actions spoke louder than his words,\u201d he said.",
      "Later, Singh\u2019s body was transported to a crematorium ground for his last rites as soldiers beat drums.",
      "Government officials, politicians and family members paid their last respects to Singh, whose casket was adorned with flowers and wrapped in the Indian flag. Security personnel honored him with a ceremonial gun salute.",
      "Indian President Draupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called Singh one of the country's \u201cmost distinguished leaders,\u201d and several Cabinet ministers participated in the funeral ceremony.",
      "Singh\u2019s body was then transferred to a pyre as religious hymns played and cremated.",
      "Authorities declared a seven-day mourning period and canceled all cultural and entertainment events during that time. Government buildings across India are flying the national flag at half-staff.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh was prime minister for 10 years and leader of the Congress party in Parliament\u2019s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to be prime minister in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress party\u2019s crushing defeat in 2014 national elections by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "Singh was the first Sikh to hold the country\u2019s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India\u2019s nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hurt his coalition government, with Communist allies withdrawing their support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized."

      "A retrospective exhibition in South Africa is honoring Esther Mahlangu, a local artist from a rural background who has become internationally known for her colorful work in traditional Ndebele painting",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- A boldly patterned BMW stands at the entrance of the Wits Arts Museum in the vibrant Johannesburg neighborhood of Braamfontein.",
      "Its bright geometric shapes are part of 89-year-old South African artist Esther Mahlangu \u2019s unmistakable style. The car is the centerpiece of an exhibition honoring her and her work.",
      "The BMW, commissioned by the German manufacturer in 1991, is among Mahlangu\u2019s most well-known works and has been returned to South Africa this year after more than 30 years abroad.",
      "Exhibition curator Nontobeko Ntombela also has included pieces that document the struggles of Nelson Mandela, who was released after almost three decades in prison and became South Africa's first Black president when the country transitioned from white minority rule to democracy in 1994.",
      "These include a letter Mahlangu wrote to Mandela thanking him for the sacrifices he made for the country.",
      "She is respected for persevering with art at a time when Black artists, especially women, were hardly acknowledged.",
      "\u201cMahlangu dared to travel an uncharted path during a time when Black women artists were systemically overlooked. I hope when people see just how much she has done, they will realize the magnitude of what she has offered to the arts,\u201d Ntombela said.",
      "The retrospective also includes a documentary about the artist, where she tells the story of her rural upbringing and her Ndebele culture.",
      "For decades, Mahlangu has used her talent to promote that culture, becoming arguably the southern African ethnic group's most recognized representative.",
      "Ntombela said much of the publicly available information about Mahlangu tends to repeat the same narratives, including her first international show in Paris in 1989.",
      "\u201cSome tend to overly emphasize the culture without the balance of discussing her work as an art form. The exhibition tries to complicate this and hopefully offers an opportunity of how her art moves across these different fields and disciplines,\" the curator said.",
      "Some of the artworks showing umgwalo, or traditional Ndebele painting, were borrowed from collections locally and abroad. Ntombela said it took about two years to secure them.",
      "\u201cNumerous works are under the ownership of international collectors, so we needed a lot of funds to bring a lot of her work back to South Africa,\u201d she said.",
      "Mahlangu is a recipient of one of South Africa's highest national awards, the Order of Ikhamanga in silver, which is awarded by the head of state.",
      "She briefly attended the launch of the exhibition last month but lives quietly in Mpumalanga province, where her colorfully decorated home remains an attraction for local and international tourists.",
      "The exhibition will run until April 17 before it embarks on an international tour starting in the United States in early 2026."

      "Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied by daily combat losses and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk, a region some want to hold at all costs while others question the value of having gone in at all.",
      "Battles are so intense that some Ukrainian commanders can\u2019t evacuate the dead. Communication lags and poorly timed tactics have cost lives, and troops have little way to counterattack, seven front-line soldiers and commanders told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so they could discuss sensitive operations.",
      "Since being caught unaware by the lightning Ukrainian incursion, Russia has amassed more than 50,000 troops in the region, including some from its ally North Korea. Precise numbers are hard to obtain, but Moscow\u2019s counterattack has killed and wounded thousands and the overstretched Ukrainians have lost more then 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk they seized in August.",
      "Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But five Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1000-kilometer (621-mile) front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east.",
      "\u201cWe have, as they say, hit a hornet\u2019s nest. We have stirred up another hot spot,\u201d said Stepan Lutsiv, a major in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade.",
      "Army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukraine launched the operation because officials thought Russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast Ukraine.",
      "It began on Aug. 5 with an order to leave Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. It became an occupation that Ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Gathering his men, one company commander told them: \u201cWe\u2019re making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn\u2019t been done since World War II.",
      "Privately, he was less certain.",
      "\u201cIt seemed crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why.\u201d",
      "Shocked by success achieved largely because the Russians were caught by surprise, the Ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of Korenevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) into Russia. That was one of the first places where Russian troops counterattacked.",
      "By early November the Russians began regaining territory rapidly. Once in awe of what they accomplished, troops\u2019 opinions are shifting as they come to terms with losses. The company commander said half of his troops are dead or wounded.",
      "Some front-line commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying Kursk.",
      "Another commander said that some orders his men have received don\u2019t reflect reality because of delays in communication. Delays occur especially when territory is lost to Russian troops, he said.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what\u2019s under our control, and what isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion.\"",
      "One platoon commander said higher ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit\u2019s defensive position because he knows his men can't hold the line.",
      "\u201cThose people who stand until the end are ending up MIA,\u201d he said. He said he also knows of at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive Russian response in Kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no other option. We\u2019ll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won\u2019t stop; they\u2019ll keep advancing,\u201d said one drone unit commander.",
      "The AP requested comment from Ukraine's General Staff but did not receive a response before publication.",
      "American longer-range weapons have slowed the Russian advance and North Korean soldiers who joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, Ukrainian troops said.",
      "On Monday, Zelenskyy said 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. But they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines.",
      "One clash took place last week near Vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of Kremenne and Vorontsovo.",
      "Until last week, the area was under Ukraine's control. This week part of it has been lost to Russian forces and Ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route.",
      "Eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the Donbas \u2014 where Russia is closing on a crucial supply hub \u2014 some soldiers are more vocal about whether Kursk has been worth it.",

      "In a statement published on Instagram, Attorney General Tarek William Saab accused the officer, Nahuel Gallo, of \u201cbeing part of a group of people who tried to commit destabilizing and terrorist acts (in Venezuela) with the support of international far-right groups.\u201d",
      "In a press conference on Friday, Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich described the charges as \u201canother lie\u201d by Venezuela\u2019s government, and said that Gallo should be returned to Argentina \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "The case has ramped up tensions between Venezuela\u2019s socialist government and the right-wing administration of Argentine President Javier Milei, whose embassy in Caracas is currently sheltering five high-profile opposition activists and is surrounded by Venezuelan security forces.",
      "Gallo, a corporal in Argentina\u2019s Gendarmer\u00eda security force, was detained by Venezuelan officials on Dec. 8 after he showed up at an immigration office along Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia and sought permission to enter the country.",
      "Gallo\u2019s relatives said that he had traveled to Venezuela to visit his wife, who is Venezuelan and was in the country to spend some time with her mother. They have published an invitation letter that was sent to Gallo, and said he was on vacation at the time of his arrest.",
      "Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Argentina in August after Milei and several other Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection in July of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Argentina\u2019s diplomats were expelled, but the five opposition activists, who had sought refuge at the ambassador\u2019s residence to avoid arrest, remained in the building after they were denied safe passage out of Venezuela.",
      "The activists, who have been holed up in the embassy since March, recently said that Venezuelan security forces have cut off electricity and water to the residence in a bid to pressure them to leave the building.",
      "Venezuela officials have denied those accusations, and said that the activists used the Argentine embassy to plan terrorist acts.",
      "The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said earlier this week that 19 foreigners are currently being held in Venezuela as political prisoners.",
      "In September, two Spanish citizens who were on vacation in the south of Venezuela were arrested and accused of being part of a plot to overthrow President Maduro. They were arrested just days after Spain\u2019s parliament recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the election."

      "The Canadians called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d and said there would be further discussions but one official said the Americans remain fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada.",
      "Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly met with Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States \u2014 even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "\u201cMinister LeBlanc and Minister Joly had a positive, productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum, as a follow-up to the dinner between the Prime Minister and President Trump last month,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc.",

      "Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.",
      "Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different at the U.S.\u2019s two land borders. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. \u2014 where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually \u2014 is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency will need to start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, as early as January 14, in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling \u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Joe Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \u201cAnything else is a betrayal of our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \u201cTreasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them."

      "Many parents open 529s for their children when they are born; they have no way of knowing whether their kids will earn a scholarship or even go to college at all. Fortunately, parents of multiple children can change the beneficiary of a 529 plan.",

But don\u2019t think the 529 rollover is a loophole to save extra for retirement; there are rules that limit the conversions.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should consider when converting your 529 funds to a Roth IRA.",
      "The Roth IRA receiving the funds must be in the name of the 529 plan beneficiary.",
      "The 529 plan must be open for at least 15 years.",
      "You cannot convert 529 contributions made within the past five years (or the earnings on those contributions).",
      "The 529 funds you roll over count toward your IRA annual contribution limit.",
      "You can move a maximum of $35,000 from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA during your lifetime.",
      "529 funds must be converted by paying the amount directly to a Roth IRA\u2014you can\u2019t pay yourself and then deposit the money into the Roth IRA later.",
      "You can contribute to a Roth IRA only if you have earnings from a job, so the 529 beneficiary must have eligible earnings when the 529-to-IRA conversions occur.",
      "Roth IRA income limits do not apply to 529 rollovers.",
      "While avoiding the\u202f Roth IRA \u202fincome limits is a retirement-saving perk for those with higher income, the rest of the rules around rolling over your excess 529 funds are designed to ensure that people are using 529 plans for their intended purpose: education. The annual contribution limits as well as the lifetime cap on conversions mean that you can\u2019tdouble up on your retirement funding.",
      "So, what\u2019s the bottom line?",
      "The ability to convert unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA can help alleviate potential concerns about oversaving for education. Still, don\u2019t count on your 529 as a means to save for retirement. Instead, consider funding your Roth IRA separately.",

      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

The woman's husband wasn't in the truck and wasn't injured, he said. Willis declined to state a cause of death for the woman, and said an autopsy would be performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on Monday.",

      "Bryce Rawson, a spokesperson for the Georgia State Fire Marshal's Office, confirmed the death and injuries but said he couldn't share anything further Friday afternoon since the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The plant in Camilla, which has a population of about 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Mitchell County. Tyson bought it in 2018 as part of its $2.16 billion purchase of Keystone Foods. The union said the plant primarily produces chicken nuggets and chicken fillets for restaurants.",

    "story": [
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people\u2019s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries",
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people's lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries.",
      "This ability to store large amounts of electricity in batteries was essentially nonexistent a decade ago, but the country had about 24 gigawatt-hours operating as of the end of November, up a whopping 71% over the same date in 2023.",
      "This is welcome news to clean energy advocates including Dariella Rodriguez. She has seen what happens on days when demand for air conditioning or heating spikes and extra power plants fueled by natural gas, located in Port Morris and Mott Haven, fire up not far from where she works in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, New York.",
      "Batteries can jolt into service, sending electricity onto overhead wires, instead of these dirty \u201cpeaker\u201d plants. Rodriguez hasn't seen that transition yet, but she hopes to.",
      "\u201cThe people that are exposed to these plants are the most vulnerable people in environmental justice communities already,\u201d said Rodriguez, a director at THE POINT Community Development Corporation there, noting that lower-income people and communities of color often live near peakers.",
      "The nation\u2019s 1,000 peaker plants can be very dirty, inefficient and expensive, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog group that works for the U.S. Congress. Some 63 million people are estimated to live within a three-mile radius of one.",
      "Although peakers run only a small part of the time, they release more harmful nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide per unit of energy, the agency said. Those two pollutants cause asthma and other breathing problems.",
      "Peakers also release more greenhouse gases than other power plants do per unit of electricity.",
      "Batteries are \u201ca really obvious solution\u201d to reducing need for peakers, says Daniel Chu, senior energy planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance.",
      "Storing extra power in batteries also extends the hours of the day that you can use clean energy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always sunny, the wind\u2019s not always blowing, but energy storage can help move that generation to when it\u2019s most needed,\u201d said Tim Fox, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners.",
      "That's why at least half of battery storage facilities in the U.S. are co-located with, or in some other way support solar, an AP analysis of Energy Information Administration data shows. The amount of solar energy in the U.S. is growing and surpassed the 100-gigawatt mark this year.",
      "Another way that the addition of these batteries is helpful to the American electrical grid and grids around the world is that forecasting is getting more difficult.",
      "\u201cWith weather patterns changing, the old ways of essentially figuring out how much capacity you need on the grid for extreme events just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Oliver Garnett, director of energy services product at the technology company Fermata Energy.",
      "Last, global electricity demand is slated to increase \u2014 by about one-third to three-quarters by 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. Data centers for artificial intelligence, switching vehicles to electricity and population growth are all contributing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do we have enough power plants?\u2019 is the classic question every utility asks every year,\u201d said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the science nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe beauty of the batteries is that if there\u2019s energy in them, they can be used for unexpected needs.\u201d",
      "Otherwise, if utilities have to find more power generation, they may keep investing in plants that burn gas or coal and account for one-quarter of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, instead of retiring them.",
      "Leading the charge for adding new batteries to the grid this year was California with more than 11 gigawatt-hours operating. One way to think about this is roughly the amount of electricity that a nuclear power plant would put out over 11 hours. Then the batteries would need to be recharged to do the same thing again. It's a limited, but meaningful amount of power. In Texas, 6 gigawatt-hours were online. Arizona saw nearly 2 gigawatt-hours humming and Nevada \u2014 the fourth-largest deployer of storage in the U.S. \u2014 had 1.1 gigawatt-hours operational.",
      "Yet many states aren't using storage yet. As of November, 86% of large-scale battery storage in the U.S. was operating in just those four states.",
      "Some states haven't set targets telling utilities to go out and build or buy energy storage on their own. Only 18 states have 50 megawatt-hours or more operating.",
      "Others don't have as much clean electricity to pair with the batteries, or claim storage isn\u2019t reliable in times of crisis. It can also be challenging to connect storage to the grid. Still, experts expect more momentum.",
      "Especially in California and Texas, \u201cThat investment and that experiment is paying off very well,\u201d said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power.",
      "\u201cThe word is getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing the technology move to other parts of the country.\u201d",

      "After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated $1.22 billion was sold in California for the drawing Friday night. The high number evoked headlines and likely lured more people to convenience stores with dreams of private spacewalks above the Earth.",
      "It doesn't seem to matter that the nation's top 10 jackpots, not including Friday, already boasted 10-figure payouts. For many of us, something stirs inside when a number ticks one dollar above $999,999,999.",
      "\u201cThe question lurking is, what happens when $1 billion becomes routine and people don\u2019t care about it anymore?\u201d said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of the 2022 book \u201cFor a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's no easy round number after a billion,\u201d Cohen said. \"But also, how much money can one person possibly, possibly, possibly need?\u201d",
      "Mega Millions ticket prices are set to rise from $2 to $5 in April. The increase will be one of many changes that officials say will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts.",
      "Here's brief history of lotteries and why jackpots are growing:",
      "Cohen notes in his book that lotteries have existed in one form or another for more than 4,000 years.",
      "In Rome, emperors and nobles held drawings at dinner parties and awarded prizes that ranged from terra cotta vases to people who were enslaved. As early as the 1400s, lotteries were used in Europe to fund city defenses and other public works.",
      "Sweepstakes were common in the American colonies, helping to pay for the revolution against Britain. Cohen noted in his book that Thomas Jefferson approved of lotteries, writing that they were a tax \u201claid on the willing only.\u201d",
      "Lotteries began to fall out of favor in the U.S. in the 1800s because of concerns over fraud, mismanagement and impacts on poor people. But starting in the 1960s, states began to legalize them to help address financial shortfalls without raising taxes.",
      "\u201cLotteries were seen as budgetary miracles, the chance for states to make revenue appear seemingly out of thin air,\u201d Cohen wrote.",
      "When Mega Millions started in 1996, it was called \u201cThe Big Game\u201d and involved only six states. It was meant to compete with Powerball, which then had 20 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The original payout for The Big Game started at $5 million. The value would be nearly twice that today accounting for inflation.",
      "In 2024 dollars, the before-taxes prize could buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution or cover Michael Soroka's $9 million contract to pitch next season for the Washington Nationals.",
      "By contrast, the pre-tax winnings from Friday\u2019s Mega Millions prize could theoretically buy a Major League Baseball team. The Nationals would be too expensive. But Forbes recently valued the Miami Marlins at $1 billion.",
      "A better comparison might be Taylor Swift's tour revenue at the end of 2023. Her Eras Tour became the first to earn more than $1 billion after selling more than 4 million tickets.",
      "Swift, however, was expected to bring in a total of more than $2 billion when her tour finally wrapped up Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "These days, Mega Millions and its lottery compatriot Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico.",
      "In October, Mega Millions said it hoped increased ticket revenue and less stratospheric odds would lead to more people winning, even as prizes grow extraordinarily high.",
      "Games with massive payouts tend to be more popular despite the slimmer odds. Larger jackpots also attract more media attention, increase ticket sales and bring in new players, Cohen said.",
      "Lottery officials have allowed the odds to become lower with a larger pool of numbers to pick from, Cohen said. And that has made games harder to win, leading to payouts rolling over into even larger prizes.",
      "The first $1 billion jackpot was in 2016. Cohen said he expects the upward trajectory to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, he warned against the tropes of the troubled or bankrupt lottery winner.",
      "A well-known example is Andrew \u201cJack\u201d Whittaker Jr. He won a record Powerball jackpot after buying a single ticket in 2002 but quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks as he endured constant requests for money, leaving him unable to trust others.",
      "Most winners don't turn out like him, Cohen said.",
      "\u201cEven if we deny it, we all sort of believe in the meritocracy \u2014 this belief that if you won your money through luck, then you probably didn\u2019t actually deserve it,\u201d Cohen said. And yet various studies have shown \u201clottery winners are happier, healthier and wealthier than the rest of us.\u201d",

The Justice Department had sued to block the $3.3 billion deal, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a rule that cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos",
      "WASHINGTON -- Cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos under a federal rule proposed Thursday.",
      "The proposal from the Food and Drug Administration and mandated by Congress is intended to reassure consumers about the safety of makeup, baby powder and other personal care products.",
      "It follows years of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson and other companies alleging links between talc-based baby powder and cancer.",
      "Despite the lawsuits, research has found mixed evidence of a potential link between cancer and talc, although the possibility has been recognized for decades because of how it is mined.",
      "Talc is a mineral used to absorb moisture or improve the texture, feel and color of cosmetics. It is mined from underground deposits that are sometimes located near the toxic mineral asbestos. The risk of cross contamination has long been recognized by cosmetic companies.",
      "But recent FDA-sponsored testing hasn't uncovered any safety issues. Since 2021, laboratory analysis of more than 150 cosmetic samples has come back negative for asbestos, according to the FDA.",
      "Still, concerns about the risk prompted Congress to pass a 2023 law requiring the FDA to release new industry standards for asbestos testing.",
      "Dr. Linda Katz, the director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said in a statement that the agency has \u201ccarefully considered the scientific evidence and complex policy issues related to detecting and identifying asbestos in talc and talc-containing cosmetic products.\u201d",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\u201d Katz said.",
      "The long-running litigation against J&J alleges that the company\u2019s talc baby powder caused women to develop ovarian cancer, when used for feminine hygiene.",
      "A J&J subsidiary has proposed paying roughly $8 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits. As part of the deal, the subsidiary would declare bankruptcy, although that proposal has been challenged in court by the Justice Department.",
      "J&J removed talc from its baby powder in the U.S. market in 2020 and then internationally in 2023. The company says it continues to stand by the safety of its products.",
      "Determining the root cause of cancer is difficult, especially in cases of ovarian cancer, which is a relatively rare form of the disease. Even large studies in thousands of women might not gather enough data to show a clear connection or definitively rule one out. The American Cancer Society says that, if there is an increased risk of cancer due to talc, \u201cit is likely to be very small.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose for the second week in a row to its highest level since mid-July, reflecting a recent jump in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price home loans.",
      "The rate rose to 6.85% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. One year ago, the rate on a 30-year mortgage averaged 6.61%.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now the highest it\u2019s been since the week of July 11, when it was at 6.89%. It dipped as low as 6.08% in September \u2014 a 2-year low \u2014 and as high as 7.22% in May,",
      "Most economists forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% next year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%. That range would be largely in line with where rates have hovered this year.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan at a lower rate, also rose this week. The average rate increased to 6% from 5.92% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.93%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market remains in a slump and on track for its worst year since 1995.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the moves in the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds.",
      "Bond yields climbed last week after the Federal Reserve signaled that it will likely deliver fewer cuts to rates next year than it forecast just a few months ago. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The biggest wildcard for mortgage rates next year is whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives will contribute to higher inflation and swell the national debt, which could keep mortgage rates elevated. That\u2019s because what happens with inflation, the U.S. deficit and the economy can have an effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The yield, which was below 3.7% as recently as September, was at 4.61% in midday trading Thursday.",

      "DETROIT -- Electric vehicles had another whirlwind year around the globe, driven by buyers in China, and growth in parts of Europe and the United States, despite headwinds.",
      "In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs.",
      "Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy. Road transport accounts for around one-sixth of all global emissions from energy, according to the International Energy Agency. Widespread EV adoption could significantly address climate change.",
      "Here are five facts about EVs this year. Most of the data comes from consultancy Rho Motion.",
      "The global EV market, including pure EVs and plug-in hybrids, grew by 25% year-over-year as of November.",
      "Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China.",
      "Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion.",
      "Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase.",
      "Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline.",
      "In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales.",
      "In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs.",
      "The best-selling pure electric vehicles were the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Tesla Model 3 \u2014 both globally and in the U.S., according to Rho Motion.",
      "The Model Y SUV was released in 2020. Its base version today costs nearly $45,000.",
      "The Model 3 was released in 2017. The least expensive version sells for around $42,000.",
      "Both have been eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S.",
      "Tesla's market share stood at 17% of all electric cars across the globe through October, according to Rho Motion.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla's market share was 49% through October. That means the company still has the biggest EV market share. But its hold is shrinking as other auto companies combined sell a growing number of electrics. For example, GM, Ford, Honda and more are offering a wider variety of EVs at lower prices and sizes and are chipping away at Tesla's longstanding lead.",

      "Continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, climbed by 46,000 to 1.91 million for the week of Dec. 14. That's more than analysts projected and the most since the week of Nov. 13, 2021 when the labor market was still recovering from the COVID-19 jobs wipeout in the spring of 2020.",

      "The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands, but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union's executive commission as part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. Russia's use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",

      "LaCroix, a senior systems engineer based in Atlanta, took time off and then worked from home while managing his son's care and appointments. But LaCroix was laid off last February from that job, where he'd been working remotely for five years. His new role requires him to spend four days a week in a company office and commute for three hours a day.",
      "\u201cI want to be around for my kids,\u201d LaCroix, 44, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to be around for my son, because we almost lost him.\u201d",
      "Heading into 2025, thousands of workers face an unsettling reality: after years of working from the comfort of home, they must return to the office full-time for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic or look for new work.",
      "Employees at Amazon, AT&T and other companies have been called back to the office five days per week. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to fire federal workers who don't show up to do their jobs in-person.",
      "\u201cPeople always want to have flexibility,\u201d said Mark Ma, a University of Pittsburgh associate professor of business administration. \u201cI have never heard anyone telling me that I thank my job because it\u2019s so rigid in its schedule.\u201d",
      "Ma researched what happened when technology and finance companies in the S&P 500 stopped allowing employees to work remotely in recent years. He found the companies experienced high turnover rates after implementing return-to-office mandates, especially among female employees \u2014 who often have childcare responsibilities \u2014 and senior-level executives.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people have adjusted their lives. They\u2019ve figured out, \u2018Oh wow, I can pick my kids up for school. Wow. I can caretake for my aging parents while I am still working,'\" said Shavon Terrell-Camper, a therapist and mental wellness coach. \u201cOnce you have tasted work-from-home ... it\u2019s difficult to see your life going back to something that could\u2019ve been unsustainable from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Workers and experts have advice to share about how to navigate the changes when an employer calls you back to the office.",
      "Employers can compromise if their goal is to increase how much time staff members spend together. Ma suggests an \u201cemployee-choice\u201d approach which gives teams the authority to decide how many days they will work in the office as a group.",
      "If that's not an option, employees also can ask to adjust their hours. LaCroix leaves home at 5 a.m. and works in the office until 2 p.m. to reduce time in traffic and allow him to be home when his kids get off the bus after school. His employer requires eight hours in the workplace but is flexible on which hours.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are pushing back, and they are trying to work out scenarios to see what type of flexibility does exist within the mandate,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Some are coming up with work-arounds that aren't endorsed by upper management. \u201cCoffee badging\u201d is a technique that involves heading to the office, swiping a company ID, having a coffee and leaving to work from home. Desperate to hold onto valuable employees, supervisors have tried a \u201chushed hybrid\u201d approach, where they take their subordinates\u2019 ID badges and swipe them \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d to make it appear they\u2019ve been in the office, Ma said.",
      "It's best to have an honest conversation with a manager about any personal needs and to \u201cask for forgiveness ahead of time, because your family is the most important thing,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. Many companies have employee assistance programs that do more than most people realize, such as directing employees to resources that can help them care for parents or children, she said.",
      "Medical conditions can make it especially challenging to work on-site. Kyle Ankney, a public relations strategist based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has cerebral palsy and needs a nurse to help him change a catheter three times a day. His health insurance will only send a nurse to one location, so working in an office isn't an option.",
      "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t an issue, I could find my way into the office,\u201d he said.",
      "Ankney, who ran his own PR firm for years, was seeking director-level roles, but a recruiter told him he should consider less-senior roles because of his need to work remotely. Instead, he applied to director-level jobs that were advertised as on-site or hybrid, and then reached out to explain his circumstances and ask if the hiring companies were open to him working from home.",
      "\u201cWhile I would never normally, especially in a career setting, lead with, \u2018I have cerebral palsy and I\u2019m in a wheelchair,\u2019 I\u2019m finding that I'm almost having to make myself vulnerable in that way just to see if the opportunity is even there for me,\u201d Ankney said.",
      "Landing a fully remote job can be competitive. \u201cThere are going to be many people that don\u2019t have the luxury just to leave\" their current jobs if they're required to return to the office, \"especially in a volatile market such as we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Attorney Holly Keerikatte was recently working on-site five days a week at a hospital, commuting about three hours a day and looking for a role that allowed more time with her family. She received two job offers. One was fully remote. The other paid 50% more but required a long commute. She recalled reading the phrase, \u201cThe only people who remember you worked late are your children.\u201d She chose the remote job.",
      "\u201cMy primary driver is what\u2019s best for my family,\u201d Keerikatte said. \u201cMy advice is to be up-front and transparent about what you want, what you\u2019re looking for and why.\"",
      "When faced with the inevitability of returning to an office, look for the positives. Friendships can blossom as colleagues take coffee breaks together or sample new lunch spots. In-person conversations can spark ideas that wouldn\u2019t surface at home.",
      "Employers can ease the transition by organizing activities that create camaraderie. For example, managers can put together a series of talks about the transition and have groups share what works for them, Dufrane said.",
      "Face-to-face contact allows people to better understand what colleagues are thinking and doing, which helps prevent resentment and can provide helpful feedback.",
      "Video director Deborah Ann DeSnoo, who owns Plug-In Inc., a video production company in Chofu, Japan, says she has worked in many countries where the film industry was male-dominated and female directors like her were uncommon. She makes a point to connect with colleagues in person, giving her a chance to bond.",

The company said on Monday night that it would \u201cimmediately terminate the contract\u201d with a contractor building the factory, the Jinjiang Group, and was \u201cstudying other appropriate measures.\u201d",
      "BYD said that the Jinjiang workers would be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and would not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been changing working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that \u201cadjustments\u201d had to be made.",
      "Li's Weibo post also included what it said was a \u201cdeclaration\u201d from the Chinese workers at the site, imprinted with red thumbprints of the men, who were shown in a video sitting together in a room.",
      "The video showed one of workers reading out a statement saying the reports of the poor and \u201cslave-like\u201d conditions had violated their human rights and that the problems were the result of misunderstandings.",
      "\u201cWe cherish this work and want to stay and work here,\u201d he said. When he finished, the workers applauded.",
      "Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD\u2019s site was especially bad, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up to be ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m.",
      "Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker\u2019s freedom of movement.",
      "Apart from living conditions for the workers, Brazilian officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated their passports and withheld 60% of their wages.

    "title": "Japan to maximize nuclear power in clean-energy push as electricity demand grows",
    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 11:42:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",

      "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",
      "TOKYO -- A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source.",
      "\u201cHow we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan\u2019s future growth,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.\u201d",
      "Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels.",
      "The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels.",
      "The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult.",
      "Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.",

      "Edmunds highlights five dream-worthy vehicles for holiday wish lists, focusing on models that are luxurious yet somewhat attainable",
      "Just about everyone dreams about cars they wish they could own, and there\u2019s no better time than the holidays to make a list of vehicles you\u2019d love to have in your driveway. The car pros at Edmunds rounded up five of their favorite dream-worthy vehicles. But rather than just list the most outlandish and expensive exotics, they focused on highlighting models that are expensive but not so pricey that it\u2019d be completely unrealistic for you to own one one day. The vehicles are ordered in ascending order of price and include destination fees.",
      "Off-road trucks look fantastic and are extremely capable. What truck enthusiast wouldn\u2019t have one topping their wish list? The king of the hill for 2025 is the F-150 Raptor R. The regular Raptor is already impressive, and the R takes it to the next level with a bonkers 720-horsepower supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine, upgraded Fox dual-value shock absorbers, and massive 37-inch all-terrain tires. An R-specific grille and hood are also part of the R\u2019s upgrades.",
      "Thankfully, the Raptor R isn\u2019t all bark and bite. It also has plenty of features to make it a livable truck for daily driving. Standard features include leather upholstery, cooling front seats, a premium sound system, and a surround-view camera to help make this big truck easier to park.",
      "Starting Price: $112,825",
      "Few sedans can match the Mercedes-Benz S-Class for opulence, luxury and prestige. This grand sedan showcases nearly every luxury, technology and performance innovation that Mercedes-Benz has concocted. Everything you touch inside is likely covered in leather, heated, or bathed in disco-worthy ambient light.",
      "A novel could be written about all of the S-Class\u2019 luxury and comfort features, but one of the most notable is the E-Active Body Control system. It scans the road surface ahead and adjusts the suspension to deliver the best ride possible. The S-Class also boasts an extensive list of advanced safety features and has an augmented reality head-up display that projects images that appear to float in front of the car. For the ultimate S-Class, get the 791-horsepower AMG S 63 E Performance model.",
      "Starting Price: $118,900",
      "Who needs a European exotic car when the Corvette ZR1 is just as capable? A sports car fanatic\u2019s wish list wouldn\u2019t be right without the ZR1. The new Corvette hit a record-setting top speed of 233 mph, making it the fastest car ever built by an American automaker and the fastest current production car priced under $1 million, according to Chevrolet.",
      "The top speed record was possible thanks to the ZR1\u2019s turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine that cranks out a staggering 1,064 horsepower. Its carbon-fiber aero package kept it glued to the track by generating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Chevrolet also says the ZR1 can accelerate through the quarter mile in less than 10 seconds. We expect the Corvette ZR1 to go on sale in early 2025.",
      "Estimated starting price: $150,000",
      "Does your wish list include a big and powerful SUV? If it does, the Escalade-V should top it. The big Caddy roars like a muscle car thanks to its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that churns out 682 horsepower and helps it hit 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. The Escalade-V also boasts enormous 24-inch wheels and large Brembo brakes that help bring the three-ton SUV to a stop.",
      "But the Escalade-V isn\u2019t only about brute power. It also has three rows of seating, plenty of cargo space and offers impressive tech like Super Cruise, a hands-free highway driving system, and an enormous 55-inch curved display that spans the dashboard.",
      "Starting Price: $161,990",
      "What if we told you there was a car that could outpace almost anything on a drag strip, keep up with high-end sports cars on a racetrack, and be comfortable enough for daily errands? Well, if that sounds amazing, add the Air Sapphire to your dream list.",
      "The Air Sapphire is a high-performance electric luxury sedan made by Lucid, an electric vehicle startup. It\u2019s one of the most powerful production cars in the world, producing an astonishing 1,234 horsepower from its three electric motors. Lucid says it has a top speed of 205 mph and can rocket to 60 mph in a mind-numbing 1.9 seconds. You can adjust the vehicle\u2019s setting for exceptional track performance or simply provide a comfortable ride around town.",
      "Starting price: $250,500",
      "Even if you can\u2019t afford any of these vehicles, you can still picture one sitting in your driveway or imagine yourself cruising around town in it. And who knows, maybe holiday magic will give you the opportunity to own one in the future.",

      "After Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed raced 19 yards for a touchdown with 1:49 remaining to regain the lead, Maiava stole the role of hero on the same field he began his collegiate career by driving Southern California 75 yards in 10 plays for the winning score.",
      "The Aggies (8-5) opened the third quarter by scoring 17 straight points to take a 24-7 lead, but squandered the lead thanks to several untimely penalties that allowed the Trojans to mount a comeback, eventually taking a 28-24 lead with 4:30 remaining.",

We don\u2019t understand how to play zone coverage, which is mind blowing to me. ... We can\u2019t cover the forward pass well enough to be a good football team, and so that\u2019s my fault.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 07:30:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Corbin Burnes and the Arizona Diamondbacks have agreed to a $210 million, six-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press",
    "story": [
      "Corbin Burnes and the Arizona Diamondbacks have agreed to a $210 million, six-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press",
      "PHOENIX -- Corbin Burnes and the Arizona Diamondbacks have agreed to a $210 million, six-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press late Friday night.",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a successful physical.",
      "The 30-year-old Burnes was perhaps the top free agent pitcher on the market after going 15-9 with a 2.92 ERA for Baltimore last season, when he earned a $15,637,500 salary. The Orioles acquired the right-hander in a February trade after he spent his first six major league seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers.",
      "It\u2019s no shock Burnes landed a big contract, but the destination is a surprise. Arizona's payroll usually ranks in the middle of the pack among big league teams, and this would be the largest contract in franchise history.",
      "Among active major league pitchers with current contracts, Burnes\u2019 $35 million average salary per year would rank fifth behind Zack Wheeler, Jacob deGrom, Blake Snell and Gerrit Cole. Burnes\u2019 agent, Scott Boras, has negotiated more than $1.6 billion in contracts for his clients this offseason.",
      "Arizona is spending in an effort to compete with the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West. The Diamondbacks, who barely missed the playoffs this year, reached the World Series in 2023 before losing to the Texas Rangers in five games.",
      "The D-backs now have a potential starting rotation that includes Burnes, Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Eduardo Rodriguez and Brandon Pfaadt, which on paper is among the best in baseball.",
      "Burnes finished fifth in Cy Young Award voting in his first year in the American League. He won the award in the National League in 2021. He\u2019s made at least 28 starts in each of the past four seasons.",
      "Aside from a poor stretch in August, Burnes was excellent last season, giving Baltimore\u2019s injury-riddled rotation an ace the Orioles could count on. Baltimore reached the postseason as a wild card and lost in two straight games to Kansas City, but that wasn\u2019t Burnes\u2019 fault. He started the playoff opener and allowed one run in eight innings of a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Burnes was also the starting pitcher for the AL in the All-Star Game in July.",
      "Burnes set a career high in 2024 with 22 quality starts. His strikeout rate of 8.38 per nine innings was his lowest since he became a starter, but his walk rate (2.22) was his best since his Cy Young-winning campaign three years earlier.",
      "The agreement between Burnes and the Diamondbacks comes after left-hander Blake Snell went to the Dodgers on a $182 million, five-year contract in November. Burnes is two years younger and has been more durable than Snell, who pitched 216 1/3 fewer innings over the past four seasons.",

      "There were no such celebrations this year when defending champion LawConnect won the race in the early hours of Saturday morning, and with good reason: It came about 24 hours after two sailors died on separate boats in sail boom accidents two hours apart on a storm-ravaged first night of the race.",
      "LawConnect, a 100-foot super maxi skippered by Australian tech millionaire Christian Beck, sailed up the River Derwent just after 2:30 a.m. Saturday.

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t actually hear it on the first night. I heard it in the early hours of the next morning,\u201d Mutter told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. \u201cWe were pretty busy. We were 100% focused on the race. Our navigator knew, and he had to just pick the right moment to let us know.\u201d",

      "New South Wales police said both yachts had been seized for evidence for a likely coroner's inquest. The Cruising Yacht Club said it would hold its own investigation.",
      "Officials also said a sailor was washed overboard on another boat, but was rescued. That crew member was from Hobart yacht Porco Rosso, and he drifted a kilometer from the yacht before being rescued.",
      "The incident triggered the crew member\u2019s emergency position-indicating radio beacon, a safety device that must be worn by all sailors in the race.",
      "\u201cThat is one of the most terrifying experiences that you can have,\u201d said David Jacobs, vice-commodore of the CYCA. \"(And) it was at night, which makes it tenfold more scary.\"",
      "The deaths came 26 years after six sailors were killed in storms during the 1998 race, which initiated a state coronial inquest and mass reforms to the safety protocols \u2014 including the radio beacon on all sailors \u2014 that govern the race. There have been 13 fatalities in the 79-year history of the race, with four of those deaths resulting from sailor heart attacks.",
      "The first all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors was entered in this year's race, but was among the retirements because of the weather. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 was one of six international entrants and includes sailors from the Philippines\u2019 national team and the country's navy.",
      "Grant Wharington, the Australian skipper of third-place Wild Thing 100 and a veteran around-the-world sailor, described the Hobart race as \u201ctesting and boat breaking.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some tragic things that have happened in the race this year,\" he said. \"It makes you second-guess whether you should be doing it for yourself, for your own health, for your well-being, and for your family.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we challenge our own personalities and our bodies. We go and do these crazy things in life, and this is one of them, and we love it. I\u2019ve done it 31 times. It holds great memories for me.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "An online spat between factions of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in the president-elect\u2019s political movement into public display",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",
      "The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking."

    "story": [
      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company.",
      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 08:10:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk&rsquo;s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta&rsquo;s Threads and its algorithms",
    "story": [
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",
      "Even as its challenges aren\u2019t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a \u201ccrossroads,\u201d said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team.",
      "\u201cWhether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,\u201d Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.",
      "That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.",
      "Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.",
      "\u201cBluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,\u201d Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're \u201ctrying to keep everybody happy\u201d are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't \u2014 see Meta's platforms \u2014 the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.",

    "story": [
      "New York correctional officers are under investigation for in-custody beating.",
      "Excerpts of body-worn camera footage from four corrections officers were released Friday by the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office showing the in-custody beating of 43-year-old inmate Robert Brooks, who the AG's office says was brutalized by prison guards while handcuffed at Marcy Correctional Facility in Oneida, New York, earlier this month.",
      "In the footage reviewed by ABC News, which the AG's office says was from a Dec. 9 incident, multiple officers can be seen holding Brooks upright on an exam table, with his arms restrained, punching and kicking him in the face, torso and genitals. The beating was described in a deposition by an investigator for the New York Department of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.",
      "Brooks had been transferred to Marcy Correctional Facility on the day of the attack from nearby Mohawk Correctional Facility.",
      "He was pronounced dead at a local hospital the following day, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is investigating the incident.",
      "\"As attorney general, you have my word that we will use every possible tool to investigate this death thoroughly and swiftly,\" James said in a press conference Friday.",
      "Elizabeth Mazur, an attorney for the Brooks family, told ABC News, \"Members of the public can now view for themselves the horrific and extreme nature of the deadly attack on Robert L. Brooks. As viewers can see, Mr. Brooks was fatally, violently beaten by a group of officers whose job was to keep him safe. He deserved to live, and everyone else living in Marcy Correctional Facility deserves to know they do not have to live in fear of violence at the hands of prison staff.\"",
      "Details of Brooks' death were outlined in the state investigator's deposition filed Tuesday by New York State Police.",
      "The deposition was filed by Ryan Paparella, an investigator for the Department of Corrections and Community Services and was brought in to review this incident. In the deposition, Paparella , details his assessment of the body camera footage showing Brooks' attack.",
      "Paparella did not mention any apparent provocation or motive in his deposition and noted Brooks had his arms and legs restrained throughout the 15-minute assault. Paparella is a former corrections officer at the same prison where the incident took place.",
      "Paparella's deposition stated: \"The male was on the ground [outside near a fence]... I observed correction officers pick up the male off the ground who was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. The hands of the black male were extended directly above his head as his upper torso was parallel with the ground. They continued to walk the male down the sidewalk and towards an open door of the infirmary.\"",
      "Paparella reported a corrections officer delivered a \"closed fist strike to the chest\" while Brooks was handcuffed, and detailed officers pushing Brooks' body up against an interior window.",
      "Preliminary findings of Brooks' autopsy by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office, \"show concern for asphyxia due to compression of the neck as the cause of death, as well as the death being due to actions of another,\" New York State Police wrote in a court filing.",
      "Paparella detailed that two sergeants and a nurse watched the attack and neglected to intervene. They are among the 14 prison staffers whom New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered to be terminated by the state.",
      "\"Like all New Yorkers, I was outraged and horrified after seeing footage of the senseless killing of Robert Brooks. I have been clear that it is the responsibility of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to provide appropriate care and protection for those in its custody, and I will not tolerate anyone who violates that responsibility,\" Hochul said in a statement Friday. \"The State of New York has zero tolerance for individuals who break the law, and I am committed to holding everyone involved fully accountable.\"",
      "One of the officers who Paparella reported participated in the incident is currently facing civil litigation for his alleged involvement in the 2020 beating of another inmate at Marcy Correctional, according to court records.",
      "The New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association issued a statement reading, \"What we witnessed is incomprehensible to say the least and is certainly not reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day... This incident has the potential to make our correctional facilities even more violent, hostile, and unpredictable than ever before.\"",
      "The Correctional Association of New York (CANY), a state oversight group, said in a statement that terminating staff involved in the incident \"is a good start, but Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature must go much further.\"",
      "\"They need to take bold and courageous actions to fulfill past commitments and bring about a new era of transparency and accountability in state government,\" the release reads.",
      "A 2023 CANY report on Marcy Correctional Facility found that four out of five prisoners reported witnessing or experiencing abuse and seven out of 10 prisoners reported racial discrimination from guards.",
      "One person interviewed at Marcy correctional facility told CANY: \"Physical abuse is rampant; the [correction officer] told me when I got here: 'This is a hands-on facility, we're going to put hands on you if we don't like what you're doing.'\"",
      "The New York Civil Liberties Union stated Brooks' death \"highlights a culture of violence and a lack of accountability for wrongdoing by corrections officers that puts the lives of incarcerated New Yorkers at risk.\"",
      "A 2024 review by the Department of Justice found that at least 28 incarcerated people were murdered while in custody during 2022, with 50 deaths classified as \"accidental,\" a term that is not defined in the report.",
      "James, the attorney general, announced Friday that four involved officers did not turn their body-worn cameras on, which violates state policy, however, the cameras recorded in standby mode with no audio.",
      "Department of Corrections Commissioner Daniel F. Martuscello III issued a memo this month, stating corrections officers' must have their body cameras actively recording during any interaction with inmates. Martuscello wrote that employees must \"immediately report any individual who intentionally or unintentionally circumvents the [body-worn camera] policy.\"",
      "\u201cThis was a killing, and people will be held accountable,\" according to a statement issued by Martuscello following Brooks' death. \u201cNo one is above the law and everyone who works here is held to the highest ethical standards. These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for. I am committed to vigorously pursuing justice for the Brooks family and ensuring that our agency takes the necessary steps to heal the community.\u201d",
      "Brooks was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2017 for stabbing his girlfriend in Monroe County.",
      "Thirteen of the staffers have been suspended without pay and one resigned the day after the incident.",

      "Tennessee has nearly total abortion ban and a porous safety net for mothers and young children",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Taylor Cagnacci moved from California to Tennessee with hopes of starting a new chapter in a state that touts a low cost of living and natural beauty.",
      "But she's infuriated by Tennessee's meager social services, which leave her and many other moms struggling in a state where abortion is banned with limited exceptions.",
      "\u201cI was going to have my child no matter what, but for other women, that\u2019s kind of a crappy situation that they put you in,\" said Cagnacci, a 29-year-old Kingsport mom who relies on Medicaid and a federally funded nutrition program. \"You have to have your child. But where\u2019s the assistance afterward?\u201d",
      "Tennessee has a porous safety net for mothers and young children, recent research and an analysis by The Associated Press found. It\u2019s unknown how many women in the state have given birth because they didn\u2019t have access to abortion, but it is clear that from the time a Tennessee woman gets pregnant, she faces greater obstacles to a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a financially stable family than the average American mom.",
      "Like other states with strict abortion bans, Tennesseans of childbearing age are more likely to live in maternal care deserts and face overall doctor shortages. Women, infants and children are less likely to be enrolled in a government nutrition program known as WIC. And Tennessee is one of only 10 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid to a greater share of low-income families.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s survival, every day,\u201d said Janie Busbee, founder of Mother to Mother, a Nashville-based nonprofit providing baby supplies for low-income moms. \u201cIf we took some of that stress off of them, then maybe they\u2019d have time to dream.\u201d",
      "GOP state leaders in Tennessee and other states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 argue that they are bolstering services for families.",
      "Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which allowed an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "The state also raised the Medicaid income limit for parents to the poverty level \u2014 nearly $26,000 for a family of three \u2014 and offers recipients 100 free diapers a month for babies under two. According to the governor's office, these changes have resulted in thousands of new parents accessing government services.",
      "\u201cPro-life is much more than defending the lives of the unborn,\u201d Republican Gov. Bill Lee said in his 2023 annual address to lawmakers and echoed more recently on social media. \u201cThis is not a matter of politics. This is about human dignity.\u201d",
      "Yet, nonprofit leaders and mothers told the AP there are still significant gaps in the safety net.",
      "Anika Chillis, a 39-year-old single mom in Memphis, has Medicaid, WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps). While she\u2019s deeply grateful for the help, she said it also can disappear \u2014 like when she temporarily lost WIC.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said, sitting on a park bench as her 2-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter played nearby. \u201cGroceries are constantly going up.\u201d And being a single mom \u201cmakes it doubly hard on you.\u201d",
      "Tennessee fared poorly at WIC enrollment, Medicaid, having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, an October study found.",
      "Other states with similarly restrictive abortion laws \u2014 such as Idaho, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia and Mississippi \u2014 ranked poorly on numerous measures, too. Researchers said restrictive states had a slightly higher average birth rate and a much lower average abortion rate than the least restrictive states.",
      "\u201cIn general, these states that restrict abortion are the more fiscally conservative, the more socially conservative states,\u201d said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Public Health.",
      "The Republican supermajority in the Tennessee legislature has long rebuffed efforts to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $35,600 for a family of three. And TennCare faces criticism already, with a federal judge ruling earlier this year that the state unlawfully terminated coverage for thousands of families and had a \u201clethargic\u201d response to nearly 250,000 children losing coverage because of paperwork problems caused by the state.",
      "DiJuana Davis, 44, was among the plaintiffs. In 2019, the Nashville resident was supposed to have surgery to prevent pregnancy and ease her chronic anemia. Days before the procedure, she was informed her Medicaid coverage had been cut off and the hospital was canceling.",
      "She later found out her renewal paperwork went to the wrong address, an error that left her uninsured for two months \u2014 during which she became pregnant and developed preeclampsia. Doctors induced labor to save her life, and her son was born prematurely.",
      "\u201cThe system is broken,\u201d she said, \u201cand it needs to be fixed.\u201d",
      "More than 3% of the 83,000 babies born in Tennessee in 2023 had mothers who didn\u2019t receive prenatal care. Only seven states had a higher share, according to an AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "After birth, doctor shortages impede ongoing care. Around a third of Tennesseans live in a primary care shortage area \u2014 a greater share than in all but 10 other states \u2014 according to an AP analysis of data from the Census Bureau and the Health Resources and Services Administration.",
      "Moms described several aid programs as frustrating to navigate. Chillis was on WIC for several months after her son was born, but then went without because of mistake during the renewal process \u2014 eventually getting it restored with help from the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center.",
      "Chillis credits a nonprofit preschool provider with linking her to aid programs in the first place: \u201cI don't see a lot of advertisements about, you know, how you can join this program or go get this\u201d service, she said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t have the knowledge.\u201d",
      "Cagnacci, who is pregnant and has a 1-year-old, said she was on SNAP for a while but missed an appointment and was unclear about the steps after that. The process to get recertified was \"such a headache\u201d that she's going without it.",
      "\u201cI just felt like it was purposely being made difficult so that I would just give up,\u201d she said.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to get social services there, according to a survey by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it\u2019s difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\u201cPeople who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\u201d said Madden, the researcher. But the weakness of the safety net shows \u201cthe hypocrisy of that argument.\u201d",
      "Tennessee\u2019s new diaper program shows the deep political divisions surrounding aid programs. The Republican governor described it as an effort to strengthen families while Democratic state Sen. London Lamar said GOP leaders are \u201ctrying to put a little bow on an abortion ban.\" And GOP state Sen. Mark Pody recently told the right-leaning news website Tennessee Conservative that \u201cit is not the state\u2019s responsibility to have a diaper for every single baby\" and floated the possibility of cutting the program.",
      "Of Tennessee's 2.8 million households, 30% earn above the poverty level but not enough to afford the basic cost of living in their counties, according to a recent report. Often, they don't qualify for government help.",
      "\u201cSome are working three jobs and still can\u2019t survive,\u201d said Busbee, of Mother to Mother.",
      "A fragmented patchwork of charities can help, but they don\u2019t cover the entire state. The Nashville Diaper Connection, for example, serves 30 counties, working with partners to provide 50 diapers a month, mostly to working families who make a bit too much for Medicaid. Other nonprofits are hindered in helping by government agencies' income rules. And most charities are constrained by the ebb and flow of donations.",
      "Nonprofit leaders fear their job may get harder with a new administration in Washington and a GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans could seek significant changes to federal assistance programs they\u2019ve long criticized, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through four years of a Trump administration, and the goal under the Trump administration was to cut social services,\u201d said Signe Anderson, the justice center's senior director of nutrition advocacy. \u201cI\u2019m concerned \u2026 for families in Tennessee and across the country.\u201d",

      "Williamson is calling for a reinvention of the Democrat party.",
      "Marianne Williamson, spiritual leader and author who ran two longshot Democratic presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, framing her run as a way to reimagine the Democratic Party as the party regroups and takes stock of its losses during the 2024 election cycle.",
      "In an announcement video posted early Thursday morning, Williamson framed her candidacy for party chair as a chance to rethink the party as a whole.",
      "\"I feel that in order for the Democrats to rise like a phoenix on the ashes of our electoral defeat, we need to look at more than just the outer issues, such as data analysis and field organizing and fundraising,\" Williamson said. \"We need to transform -- in a way, we need to reinvent the Democratic Party in order to counter what MAGA is bringing to the table.\"",
      "In an accompanying blog post, Williamson stressed Democrats must better understand President-elect Donald Trump's appeal and strategy to better counter it, adding that she wants to \"reinvent the party from the inside out.\"",
      "\"President Trump has ushered in an age of political theater -- a collective adrenaline rush that has enabled him to not only move masses of people into his camp, but also masses of people away from ours. It does not serve us to underestimate the historic nature of what he has achieved,\" Williamson wrote. \"In fact, it's important that we recognize the psychological and emotional dimensions of Trump's appeal. We need to understand it to create the energy to counter it.\"",
      "\"As Chairwoman, I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out. For if we want a new President in four years, and a new Congress in two, then we must immediately get about the task of creating a new party,\" she added later.",
      "Williamson also said that she would have a \"a 365-days-of-the-year strategy\" to allow Americans to be politically involved yearround and that she wants the party to inspire Americans.",
      "Williamson was unable to generate a groundswell of support in either of her bids for president, although she stayed in the race until the Democratic presidential primaries concluded and she gained some traction with Democrats who wanted to protest the White House on the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Williamson was also hypercritical of the DNC, in part, for not holding presidential primary debates against President Joe Biden Biden last cycle and has accused it of rigging the process against her.",
      "\"We have a very frayed bond of affection with millions of Americans particularly working people in the United States. We have to address the problem on that level. On the level of the heart. On the level of the mind,\" Williamson told ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips on Thursday afternoon. \"People aren't feeling it about Democrats anymore. At least not enough of them to make for the kind of victory we need in '26 and '28.\"",
      "Williamson needs to get the support of at least 40 DNC members to qualify for the first DNC candidate forum in early January. The DNC plans on hosting four moderated forums before the election.",
      "She joins a handful of other declared candidates for DNC chair, including Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Jamie Harrison, the current chairman, isn't running for reelection.",
      "DNC leadership elections will be held at National Harbor outside Washington on Feb. 1.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",

      "Garvey, one of the earliest internationally-known Black civil rights leaders, was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and was given a five-year sentence, according to a letter sent to Biden from the Congress members, obtained by ABC News. President Calvin Coolidge pardoned Garvey two years into his sentence. Garvey was immediately deported to his birth country of Jamaica.",
      "\"Exonerating Mr. Garvey would honor his work for the Black community, remove the shadow of an unjust conviction, and further this administration's promise to advance racial justice,\" the lawmakers said in the letter to the president. \"At a time when Black history faces the existential threat of erasure by radical state legislatures, a presidential pardon for Mr. Garvey would correct the historical record and restore the legacy of an American hero.\"",
      "Congress members have been trying for decades to clear Garvey's name, according to the congress members. Congressman John Conyers led hearings in 1987 for the House Judiciary Committee on Garvey's exoneration. Congressman Charles Rangel introduced resolutions, highlighting alleged injustices against the former civil rights leader in 2004.",
      "\"Exactly 101 years ago, Mr. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in a case that was marred by prosecutorial and governmental misconduct,\" The congress members said in the letter. \"The evidence paints an abundantly clear narrative that the charges against Mr. Garvey were not only fabricated but also targeted to criminalize, discredit, and silence him as a civil rights leader.\"",

      "Garvey was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) which was created to challenge racial inequality, according to the lawmakers. The organization championed self-determination and economic independence for Black people at a time when Jim Crow laws oppressed African Americans and colonization subjugated Africans on their own continent.",
      "Garvey also established the Black Star Line, one of the first Black-owned shipping companies in the Western Hemisphere, connecting Black businesses across the Americas, according to the lawmakers. The civil rights leader eventually wanted to route the vessels to Africa for a redemption program, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. He wanted to establish a nation for those who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, according to The Washington Post.",
      "Garvey also created the Negro World Newspaper which, at its peak, reached a circulation of 200,000 readers weekly, according to the congressmembers.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions.",
      "Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision on Monday to change the sentences of 37 of the 40 condemned people to life in prison without parole, arguing that it was senseless and insulted the families of their victims. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cWhen you hear the acts of each, you won\u2019t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d",
      "Presidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty \u201cas soon as I am inaugurated,\u201d but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of \u201cviolent rapists, murderers, and monsters.\u201d",
      "He highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty \u2014 including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cTrump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,\u201d said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cBut whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.\u201d",
      "Berman said Trump\u2019s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden\u2019s commutation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, \u2018don\u2019t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Most Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.",
      "Before Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.",
      "\u201cThe reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,\u201d Berman said.",
      "A question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.",
      "Berman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.",
      "\u201cThat would literally take decades to unfold. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Berman said.",
      "Before one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.",
      "One of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.",
      "The other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.",
      "Some families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.",
      "Biden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. _______",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Following the release of the report, Gaetz shared on X what appears to be a message he received from President-elect Donald Trump, though it is unclear when the message was sent.",
      "\"I got a great note from President Trump!\" Gaetz wrote alongside a photograph showing what appears to be a brief message from Trump, saying, \"Matt very unfair!\"",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "Last month, Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",
      "\"After Plaintiff's resignation from Congress, Defendants improperly continued to act on its investigation, and apparently voted to publicly release reports and/or investigative materials related to Plaintiff without proper notice or disclosure to Plaintiff,\" the complaint said.",
      "Following the report's release Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta gave Gaetz until 5 p.m. ET to show why the suit shouldn't be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, given \"this case appears to be moot in light of the House Ethics Committee's public disclosure of the report.\"",
      "In a subsequent filing, attorneys for Gaetz acknowledged that their lawsuit is now \"mooted\" following the release of the report -- a move they said has caused Gaetz \"irreversible and irreparable harm.\"",
      "The filing said the committee's decision to release the report was \"unprecedented and procedurally defective,\" and reiterated their claim that it was released without notifying him.",

      "Fetterman said his colleagues should \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said he hopes President-elect Donald Trump is successful in his second term and that he's not \"rooting against him.\"",
      "\"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\" Fetterman told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"So country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"",
      "Fetterman, who has made headlines as one of the few in his party who have met with several of Trump's cabinet picks, said his Democratic colleagues need to \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

      "Alexander Materne, 28, drove the girl to his home in St. Rose, Louisiana, on Dec. 23 and had sex, after which the girl disclosed her age, the St. Charles Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release.",
      "Materne then brought the girl to a secluded, wooded area in Tangipahoa Parish and left her there with a tent, food and water, authorities said. He then went to Jennings, Louisiana, to celebrate Christmas with his family, officials said.",
      "Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Gerald Sticker said the two had met on a gaming platform and had made a plan for Materne to drive to her home in Tennessee.",
      "Materne faces numerous charges, including aggravated kidnapping of a child and felony counts of human trafficking and carnal knowledge. Jail records do not show if he has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.",
      "The break in the case, Sticker said, came when the girl\u2019s parents did their own investigation and tracked Materne to Jennings, Louisiana, where his family lived, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) west of Materne's home in St. Rose.",
      "\u201cThey were the key to all of this,\" Sticker said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you if they want a job, I\u2019ll hire both of these parents as investigators.\u201d",

The next day, police were notified that Materne had showed up at the family home to celebrate Christmas and he agreed to an interview with officers.",

      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "A California appeals court has overturned the rape conviction of former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A California appeals court has overturned the rape conviction of former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield after determining prosecutors made racially discriminatory statements during the Black man's trial.",
      "The retired football player was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in October 2020 after being convicted of raping a developmentally disabled woman in 2015 who prosecutors said he lured to his home with the promise of a babysitting job.",
      "The Sixth Court of Appeals found Wednesday that prosecutors violated the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, a law passed during a summer of protest over the police killing of George Floyd. The measure bars prosecutors from seeking a criminal conviction or imposing a sentence on the basis of race.",
      "Prior to the law, defendants who wanted to challenge their convictions on the basis of racial bias had to prove there was \u201cpurposeful discrimination,\u201d a difficult legal standard to meet.",
      "The appeals court said prosecutors used \u201cracially discriminatory language\u201d that required them to overturn Stubblefield's conviction.",
      "The case was \u201cinfected with tremendous error from the minute we started the trial,\u201d said Stubblefield's lead attorney, Kenneth Rosenfeld.",
      "In April 2015, Stubblefield contacted the then-31-year-old woman on a babysitting website and arranged an interview, prosecutors said.",
      "According to a report by the Morgan Hill Police Department, the interview lasted about 20 minutes. She later received a text from Stubblefield saying he wanted to pay her for her time that day, and she went back to the house.",
      "The woman reported to the police that Stubblefield raped her at gunpoint, then gave her $80 and let her go. DNA evidence matched that of Stubblefield, the report said.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said police never searched Stubblefield's house and never introduced a gun into evidence, saying it was because he was famous Black man and it would \u201copen up a storm of controversy,\" according to the appellate decision.",
      "By saying Stubblefield\u2019s race was a factor in law enforcement\u2019s decision not to search his house, prosecutors implied the house would've been searched and a gun found had Stubblefield not been Black, the appeals court said. The reference to controversy also links Stubblefield to the events after the recent killing of Floyd based on his race.",
      "Defense attorneys said there was no rape, and Stubblefield said the woman consented to sex in exchange for money.",
      "\u201cThe trial had a biased judge who didn't allow the evidence from the defense, the fact that she was a sex worker, to be heard in front of a jury,\u201d Rosenfeld said. He called the incident a \u201ctransactional occasion\u201d between Stubblefield and the woman.",
      "He remains in custody until a hearing next week, during which his attorneys will ask a judge to approve a motion to release him. Prosecutors have several options, including asking the court to stay their decision so they can appeal to the state's Supreme Court, or refile charges.",
      "The Santa Clara District Attorney's Office said it was \u201cstudying the opinion.\u201d",
      "Stubblefield began his 11-year lineman career in the NFL with the 49ers in 1993 as the league\u2019s defensive rookie of the year. He later won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1997 before leaving the team to play for Washington. He returned to the Bay Area to finish his career, playing with the 49ers in 2000-01 and the Raiders in 2003."

      "The top U.N. humanitarian official in Yemen says Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen\u2019s main airport as a civilian Airbus 320 with hundreds of passengers on board was landing this week",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen\u2019s main airport as a civilian Airbus 320 with hundreds of passengers on board was landing and a U.N. delegation was waiting to leave, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in Yemen said Friday.",
      "Julien Harneis told U.N. reporters that the most frightening thing about the two airstrikes on Thursday wasn\u2019t their effect on him and about 15 others in the VIP lounge at the international airport in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, including the head of the U.N. World Health Organization.",
      "Rather, it was the destruction of the airport control tower as a Yemenia Airways plane was taxiing in after touching down.",
      "\u201cFortunately, that plane was able to land safely and the passengers were able to disembark, but it could have been far, far worse,\u201d said Harneis, who was with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the lounge.",
      "He said one airstrike landed approximately 300 meters (330 yards) south of the VIP lounge and another about 300 meters to the north around 4:45 p.m., while about five members of the U.N. team were outside the building.",
      "\u201cNot only obviously did we have zero indication of any potential airstrikes, but we cannot remember the last time there were airstrikes in Sanaa during daylight hours,\u201d Harneis said in a video news conference from Sanaa.",
      "The U.N. said at least three people were killed and dozens injured in the strike. Among the injured was a crew member from the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, which was about to fly the U.N. delegation of some 20 people out of Sanaa.",
      "He suffered a serious leg injury from shrapnel and lost a lot of blood, Harneis said.",
      "Immediately after the airstrikes, Harneis said, U.N. security officials moved the delegation out of the VIP building and into five armored cars where they waited for approximately 40 minutes to ascertain what happened and help the injured crew member.",
      "He was taken to a hospital in Sanaa and underwent four hours of surgery while the rest of the delegation spent the night in a U.N. compound, Harneis said. The U.N. plane with Tedros and the U.N. team, including the injured crew member, was able to depart for Jordan on Friday afternoon \u2013 without an operating control tower.",
      "The United Nations said the injured crew member was taken to a hospital in Jordan, and Tedros was heading back to Geneva, where WHO is based,",
      "Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country\u2019s north, have gone after Israel since it started attacking Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Gaza's Hamas militants on southern Israel. The Houthis have attacked ships in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world\u2019s main maritime routes, and recently stepped up missile and drone attacks on Israel. Early Saturday, the Israeli Air Force reported intercepting yet another missile from Yemen, as sirens woke Israelis around Jerusalem and the Dead Sea.",
      "Israel has escalated its response.",
      "The Israeli army said it wasn\u2019t aware that the WHO chief or U.N. delegation were at the Sanaa airport on Thursday. Israel said it bombed the airport because it is used by the Houthis and Iran.",
      "Harneis responded, stressing that the airport is civilian, not military, and is used for transporting U.N. and other humanitarian workers, and for one civilian flight \u2014 Yemenia to and from Amman, Jordan. The flight operates as a result of an international agreement, and thousands of Yemenis have used the flight to get advanced medical treatment abroad, he said.",
      "Yemen is the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation and has been engulfed in a 10-year civil war between the Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country's north, and the internationally recognized government forces in the south.",
      "Tedros was in the country to discuss its worsening humanitarian crisis and to seek the release of about 50 people detained by the Houthis since June from the U.N., nongovernmental organizations and civil society.",
      "Harneis said 18 million Yemenis \u2014 about half the country\u2019s population \u2014 need humanitarian assistance this year, and the U.N. expects the number to increase to 19 million next year because of the worsening economy.",
      "In addition to airstrikes on the Sanaa airport, Israel has been attacking the country's key port of Hodeida, in western Yemen.",
      "Harneis said Yemen relies on imports through Hodeida for 80% of its food and more than 90% of its medical supplies to the north.",
      "A recent Israeli airstrike destroyed two tugboats and is estimated to have reduced the harbor's capacity by 50%, the U.N. official said, while damage from Thursday's airstrikes hasn't been assessed yet.",
      "As for the detainees, Harneis said he joined the WHO chief at meetings with the Houthi prime minister, foreign minister and a member of the group's Supreme Political Council. He said they received commitments on the detainees' possible release and a pathway to it, and on conditions under which they are being held."

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d his wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" said Berson.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "He hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the World Figure Skating Championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \"By my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\"",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his career as a sportscaster, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "Jeffrey Maddrey stood silently as his lawyer, Lambros Lambrou, addressed allegations that culminated in resignation a week ago as chief of department, the NYPD's highest-ranking uniformed officer.",
      "Lambrou, speaking to reporters at his Manhattan law office, said that the 33-year NYPD veteran's relationship with Lt. Quathisha Epps lasted only a \u201cshort time.\u201d The lawyer said Maddrey had no authority to sign off on overtime pay.",

      "Epps raised allegations against Maddrey last weekend in a complaint she filed against the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.",
      "In it, she claimed Maddrey engaged in \u201cquid pro quo sexual harassment\u201d by coercing her to \u201cperform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.\u201d",
      "Epps, who held an administrative post in Maddrey\u2019s office, was the NYPD's top earner in fiscal year 2024, according to payroll data, pulling in more than $400,000. More than half of it was overtime pay.",
      "Epps contends that when she finally pushed back at Maddrey\u2019s demands, he retaliated by claiming she was abusing overtime, prompting the department to launch a review. Lambrou said Friday that the timing didn't add up because Epps was already under investigation before she filed her complaint.",

      "\u201cWe have a treasure trove of digital data that will hopefully bring this degenerate to justice,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Maddrey, a close ally of mayor and former police captain Eric Adams, joined the NYPD in 1991 and rose through the ranks to become chief of patrol in 2021.",
      "Last year, Maddrey was promoted to chief of department despite a history of internal disciplinary issues, including an allegation that he lied to investigators about an affair with another subordinate.",
      "Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Maddrey's resignation on Dec. 20, effective immediately. She appointed John Chell, the former chief of patrol, to the position on an interim basis.",
      "The NYPD has declined to comment on the allegations against Maddrey other than to say it \u201ctakes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will thoroughly investigate this matter.\u201d",
      "Maddrey\u2019s resignation follows months of scandal and leadership turnover at the NYPD, the nation\u2019s largest police department. In September, Commissioner Edward Caban resigned after federal agents searched his home as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into members of Adams\u2019 inner circle.",
      "Soon after, Timothy Pearson, another Adams adviser with wide latitude over the NYPD, resigned after investigators seized devices and cash from his home. He has also been accused of sexual harassment by multiple colleagues.",
      "Neither Pearson nor Caban have been criminally charged, and both have denied wrongdoing."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency will need to start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, as early as January 14, in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling \u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Joe Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \u201cAnything else is a betrayal of our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \u201cTreasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them."

      "Less than two weeks after being sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars, Lawrence Hecker died of natural causes at 3 a.m. Thursday at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, according to Ken Pastorick, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections communications director.",
      "Hecker had pleaded guilty to charges including first-degree rape and aggravated kidnapping shortly before jury selection for his long-delayed trial had been scheduled to begin earlier this month, with other victims prepared to testify against him.",
      "The survivor of the assault to which Hecker pleaded guilty had said that Hecker raped him after offering to instruct him in wrestling moves ahead of tryouts for a school team in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cThe only prayer I can come up with I hope he spends eternity in hell after God's judgment of him,\u201d the survivor said in a written statement provided by his attorney, Richard Trahant.",
      "\u201cNow after his death I feel vindicated and free,\u201d he said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "Hecker's trial had been delayed for months partly because of questions around his mental competency. Hecker had suffered from dementia, his lawyer Bobby Hjortsberg said.",
      "Hecker had been ordained as an archdiocesan priest in 1958 and remained in this position even after facing an undisputed complaint of child molestation in the late 1980s, according to court records. Hecker left the ministry in 2002.",
      "Hecker's conviction occurred amid a wave of sexual abuse allegations against the Catholic church in New Orleans, many resurfacing from decades ago. The fallout has left the Archdiocese of New Orleans embroiled in bankruptcy negotiations.",

      "MACON, Ga -- A shooting that killed one man and wounded six other people took place at a \u201cshot house\u201d where alcohol was being sold illegally, officials in middle Georgia\u2019s largest city said.",
      "The shooting happened at around 1 a.m. Thursday in the same house on Macon's south side where a person was fatally shot in January.",
      "Bibb County sheriff's deputies said Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, died at a hospital. Another man was critically injured, while five others are expected to recover.",
      "In a news conference Thursday, Sheriff David Davis said an argument broke out among people gathered at the house and that one person \u201ctook a gun out and started just seemingly indiscriminately shooting.\u201d",
      "Davis said investigators are seeking to question someone in the shooting but didn't name a suspect. He said there are many witnesses, but that some were hospitalized, others didn't want to talk because they were doing something illegal, and others were drunk. Davis said investigators have a blurry photograph of a dark vehicle but are seeking more pictures or video to help identify it.",
      "He said deputies may also seek charges against the property owner for allowing the bootlegging to take place.",
      "\u201cWhen you have people that mix alcohol, guns and then some type of argument, that\u2019s when it can be dangerous, and in this case, deadly,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Davis said sheriff's deputies have been trying to shut down shot houses in the neighborhood for more than a year. He said multiple arrests were made at the house where the shooting happened and another house in November 2023. He said deputies succeeded in shutting down the site of Thursday's shooting for much of this year, and there had only been four police calls to the location this year, with bootlegging activity shifting to another house on the street. But Davis said illegal alcohol sales appear to have resumed at the first house in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like playing Whac-A-Mole, you know,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch them one place, and then they\u2019ll move to another.\u201d",
      "Although Davis said deputies, including some that are undercover, have been present in the neighborhood, nearby residents and business owners called for more visible police patrols.",
      "\u201cThe more you see patrols, the less crime there is,\u201d Jake Fincher, who owns nearby Fincher's Barbecue, told WMAZ-TV. \u201cOut of sight, out of mind doesn\u2019t work.\u201d"

    "summary": "The prime minister writes to regulators including Ofgem and Ofwat for ideas to boost economic growth.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary have written to the UK's main regulators asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me.

      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",

      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",

    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",

Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",

      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",

    "summary": "The government says it will \"restore clarity\" for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry.",
    "story": [
      "The UK motor industry is being consulted over how the phasing-out of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 will work, the government has announced.",
      "The ban on sales of these vehicles had been extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government but Labour said it would restore the 2030 deadline in its election manifesto.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is now seeking views from automotive and charging experts to \"restore clarity\" on how to deliver the ban.",
      "Car industry leaders have warned drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and charging point infrastructure.",
      "Last month, Ford said the UK government's mandate to produce and sell more electric vehicles (EVs) \"just doesn't work\" without demand.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "The Department for Transport said the consultation would \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry\" so they \"have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\".",
      "'The price point is crazy'",
      "But some say they are not yet sold on switching to EVs. Kaylan Evans from London said she wouldn't buy an electric car because \"the price point is crazy\".",
      "\"I don't like the element of relying on charging points and stations when the infrastructure isn't that set up at the moment,\" she added.",
      "She said she and her husband are sticking to their petrol car for now.",
      "Meanwhile, Angelina who is also from London says living in a block of flats there is not \"an option to charge\" vehicles there and wondered how having a personal electric point installed would affect electricity bills.",
      "She wants to move away from her diesel car because of \"the rising cost of fuel and the environmental issues\".",
      "Hybrid sales",
      "The government said the consultation would be part of a \"wider push\" to make it easier and cheaper to charge electric cars.",
      "There are now more than 72,000 public charging points in the UK, with another 100,000 planned by local authorities across England, according to the government.",
      "The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and homes without private parking spaces poses an issue as well - one that analysts will take several years to resolve.",
      "The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts.",
      "The government said EVs made up one in four cars sold in the UK. It said industry data put 1 in 3 used electric cars at under \u00a320,000.",
      "Edmund King, president of the AA, said drivers have been \"hesitant about the transition but not hostile\" but the consultation would bring more clarity and certainty.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said it was \"imperative we get an urgent resolution\" to adapt the mandate to help car makers achieve it along with \"bold incentives\" to get drivers to buy electric vehicles.",
      "The consultation proposes updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle (Zev) mandate, which sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise. Firms failing to meet these targets face a \u00a315,000 fine per sale.",
      "Companies can avoid fines by buying \"credits\" from firms that have exceeded their quotas for electric car sales. They can also \"borrow\" allowances from future years.",
      "The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank said target required to be achieved by each manufacturer was due to be reached as an average across the industry because these credits would be taken into account.",
      "Colin Walker, transport lead at the ECIU added: \"Certain manufacturers are proving themselves not just equal but better to the task they've been set. The likes of BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, for example. They are all selling more EV's than they need to. It's proof it can be done and that more ambitious targets in the years ahead can be hit.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Where does the UK get its energy from?",
      "The government's eight-week consultation aims to gather views on which cars can be sold alongside zero emission vehicles from 2030, including full hybrids and plug-in hybrids, as well as the strategy for vans and the policy for small volume manufacturers.",
      "More than two-thirds of car manufacturers in the UK, including Stellantis, have committed to transitioning fully to electric cars by 2030.",
      "However, firms have also announced thousands of job cuts, partly because of EV targets.",
      "UK car production experienced a sharp decline in October 2024, with overall output dropping by over 15% compared to the previous year. Automotive industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed this fall to weak demand and a significant decrease in exports.",
      "Electric and hybrid vehicle production saw an even steeper decline, falling by one-third due to flagging European demand and factory retooling for new models.",
      "\"Today's measures will help us capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain,\" Alexander said.",
      "Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK said this was an opportunity to position the UK as \"one of the most attractive battery EV markets on the global stage.\" He said there was a growing demand for used and new batteries, and this roadmap would give manufacturers and users more clarity."

      "Councils decide whether someone with care needs, such as a mental or physical health problem, qualifies for supported housing. It also determines who can provide it and pays the rent.",
      "Many charities and other non-profit groups provide supported housing without issue, but the housing select committee found issues arose when private firms began entering the sector over the last decade to provide \"exempt\" supported accommodation.",

      "Charities and MPs argue these exempt supporting housing firms have exploited a lack of regulation and the benefit loophole to make millions while providing low-quality housing.",
      "In response to these concerns, the new law gives the department for housing and local councils powers to set standards for supported housing providers, but no exact start date has been set for a consultation into how the law will work.",

      "At the same time supported housing supply is falling, many charities say demand has soared due to NHS cuts and rising homelessness.",

    "story": [
      "Pascual Andreu points proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914.",
      "But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.",
      "\"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\"",
      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",
      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",
      "Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.",
      "\"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.",
      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",
      "\"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over \u20ac1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.",
      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "Only 40.1% of fourth year pupils - typically aged 14-16 years old - achieved a pass rate for National 5 mathematics in 2024, while 75.2% passed English. Just over 25% passed the most popular science subject, biology.",

      "The Commission on School Reform is an independent group of education experts, set up by think tank Reform Scotland.",

      "Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Ford said issues like staffing could be a contributing factor to the reason for the decline in student performance, but Scotland does not collect enough data to examine the true cause.",

      "\"Pupils are choosing subjects on the basis of where they are most likely to succeed and that's even more concerning because we have to ask ourselves, why do fewer pupils now expect to succeed in maths and in stem subjects?",
      "\"For society as whole, this is not good news. Society develops on the back of an educated population and not having the level of education in sciences and mathematics that other countries do will be to Scotland's disadvantage.\"",
      "'Not good enough'",
      "Chair of Reform Scotland and former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell said it was \"very worrying\" that less than half of Scotland's 16-year-olds had passed National 5 maths.",
      "He added:  \"If our economic future is to be based around industries like renewable energy and health sciences, improving our pass rates in mathematics and the sciences is a matter of critical national importance.",

      "Some students may not obtain a National 5 qualification in maths in S4 but go on to get one in S5.",
      "Another factor is worth considering too.",
      "Once English and maths, or at least arithmetic, were effectively compulsory for students in S4.",
      "Now they are often just options, albeit relatively popular ones.",
      "This reflects how many schools only allow students to do a maximum of six National 4 or 5 courses in S4.",
      "There are several issues worthy of discussion.",
      "One is whether young people at all schools should have the chance to obtain more than 6 qualifications in S4.",
      "Another is whether certain subjects should, in effect, be mandatory as was once the case. (Until the 1980s any student with a reasonable prospect of passing was expected to do O Grade English and Maths. From the late 80s on, most would study Standard Grade courses in these subjects at the appropriate level.)",
      "If, however, compulsion is not the answer some supporters of particular subjects may want to consider if more can be done to make them attractive options which a greater number of students might positively choose."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 02:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Carmen Souza's latest album is inspired by the little-known British influence on the Cape Verde islands.",
    "story": [
      "When she was a young child and taking too long to get ready for school, family get-togethers or to sing in the church choir, Cape Verdean musician Carmen Souza was often told to \"ariope\".",
      "What she did not realise until years later was that the Creole word came directly from the English word \"hurry up\".",
      "\"We have so many words that derive from the British English,\" Souza, a jazz singer-songwriter and instrumentalist, tells the BBC.",
      "\"'Salong' is 'so long', 'fulespide' is 'full speed', 'streioei' is 'straightaway', 'bot' is 'boat', and 'ariope' - which I always remember my father saying to me when he wanted me to pick up my pace.\"",
      "Ariope is now one of eight songs that Souza has composed for the album Port'Ingl\u00eas - meaning English port - to explore the little-known history of the 120-year-old British presence in Cape Verde. It started off as research for her master's degree.",
      "\"Cape Verdeans are very connected to music - in fact, we always say that music is our biggest export - and so I wondered whether there was also a musical impact,\" she says.",
      "There are very few recordings of compositions of the time - Souza did discover that an American ethnomusicologist, Helen Heffron Roberts, recorded some in the 1930s but they are on very fragile wax cylinders and can only be listened to in person at Yale University in the US.",
      "So rather than rearranging old recordings, Souza - and her musical partner Theo Pas'cal - created new music, inspired by stories she came across.",
      "She has combined jazz and English sea shanties with Cape Verdean rhythms - including the funan\u00e1, played on an iron rod with a knife and the accordion, and the batuque, played by women and based on African drumming rhythms.",
      "The Cape Verdean islands lie about 500km (310 miles) off the coast of West Africa. They are mostly arid, with limited arable land and prone to drought.",
      "But they are a strategic midway point in the Atlantic Ocean, and they were first controlled by the Portuguese as they traded between south-east Asia, Europe and the Americas - in spices, silk and enslaved people. With the abolition of the slave trade, Cape Verde went into decline.",
      "Cape Verde remained a Portuguese colony until 1975 - but during the 18th and 19th Centuries, British merchants settled and Cape Verde once again became a bustling crossroads.",
      "The British came for the cheap labour, goats, donkeys, salt, turtles, amber and archil, a special ink that was used in British clothes manufacturing.",
      "They built roads, bridges and developed the natural ports - which became known as Port'Ingl\u00eas - and set up coaling stations, with coal brought in from Wales.",
      "S\u00e3o Vicente's Mindelo port became a vital refuelling stop for steamships carrying goods across the Atlantic Ocean or to Africa - and an important global communications hub with the 1875 arrival of a submarine cable station.",
      "Souza's exploration of the British presence in Cape Verde quickly became personal.",
      "\"As I started to research, I found so many personal connections,\" Souza says - including the fact that her grandfather loaded coal on to ships in Mindelo.",
      "That inspired her to write Ariope - the story of an older man urging a younger man, who prefers to stay in the shade playing his guitar, to \"ariope\". The British ships are coming and the sailors do not like to wait - \"fulespide, streioei\", the song goes.",
      "Souza imagines the spirit of her grandfather in the song. He used to play the fiddle - and was known as a great storyteller.",
      "\"I was told that if you had to walk with him for kilometres, you wouldn't notice the distance because it would be one funny story after another.\"",
      "Souza is part of Cape Verde's large diaspora. She was born in Portugal, and now lives in London. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are about 700,000 Cape Verdeans living abroad - twice as many as at home.",
      "Historically, people were forced to move for work because of famine, drought, poverty and lack of opportunities.",
      "This movement contributed to the islands' deep, rich tradition of strongly distinctive music, including the melancholic morna made famous by singer Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora and declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco in 2019.",
      "The composer behind many of the songs that made \u00c9vora a global star was Francisco Beleza - also known as B L\u00e9za. He revolutionised morna and was one of Cape Verde's most influential writers, composers and morna singers.",
      "According to Souza's research, he also considered the British presence to be more beneficial than the Portuguese - at least to middle-class Cape Verdeans.",
      "Souza's track Amizadi, a mix of funan\u00e1 and jazz, was inspired by B L\u00e9za's admiration of the British. He composed a morna - Hitler ca ta ganha guerra, ni nada, meaning \"Hitler will not win the war\" to show solidarity with the British people during World War II - and even raised money for the British war effort.",
      "Souza found that ports were \"an important hub for musicians\" who flocked there to learn the music - and instruments - of visiting foreign sailors.",
      "They blended them with Cape Verdean rhythms to create new sounds. The mazurka - derived from a Polish musical form - and contradan\u00e7a from the British quadrille dance.",
      "Early written records of Cape Verdean music are scarce - the Portuguese colonists did not document life and society on Cape Verde other than records of taxes and commodities.",
      "They also banned the batuque - for being too noisy and too African - and funan\u00e1 because its lyrics challenged social inequalities.",
      "But Souza found an intriguing entry in the diary of British naturalist Charles Darwin, who arrived in Cape Verde in 1832 - the first stop on his famous Beagle voyage to study the living world.",
      "He describes an encounter with a group of about 20 young women who, writes Darwin, \"sung with great energy a wild song, beating with their hands upon their legs\".",
      "That, says Souza, is most probably an early performance of batuque - and she was inspired to write the song Sant Jago by Darwin's accounts of the warm hospitality he received on Cape Verde.",
      "Many younger Cape Verdean musicians tend not to play the islands' older rhythms, and some like the contradan\u00e7a are slowly dying out.",
      "Souza hopes that her Port'Ingl\u00eas album will inspire younger generations that \"there is a way to do something new with the traditional genres\".",
      "\"I always bring some different elements - improvisation, the piano, the flute, the jazz harmonisation - so that the music is going through another process of creolisation.\"",

    "summary": "Call the Midwife creator Heidi Thomas on how fans accost her in public to tell her their private stories.",
    "story": [
      "Call the Midwife creator Heidi Thomas is used to being told unexpected things over her shopping trolley.",
      "\"I was in the supermarket, and a woman came up and said, 'I gave birth standing up',\" she laughs. \"What am I going to do with that?\"",
      "Probably more than you might think, given she's behind the popular TV series which tells a myriad of birth stories.",
      "Thomas's Bafta-winning BBC drama explores the lives of the midwives and nuns who live together in a convent, Nonnatus House, and the families they care for in post-war east London.",
      "\"Call the Midwife will always be a drama for me about women and the working classes,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "The British writer's superpower is arguably her ability to deftly mix stories of care and warmth with the brutal realities of poverty, racism, backstreet abortions, child loss and domestic abuse, to name but a few.",
      "The BBC One show - consistently a high performer in TV ratings - is now approaching its 14th series since 2012, which is no mean feat in an increasingly competitive TV landscape.",
      "Thomas manages to cram in tough storylines into a cosy 8pm, Sunday night slot, often shared with shows such as Antiques Roadshow.",
      "There have only been two instances where she's been asked to change something in the show, which was initially set in 1957 and is about to hit the 1970s.",
      "\"One was for the haemorrhage machine,\" she recalls, describing a contraption which recreates post-birth blood loss.",
      "\"I think it's a unique piece of equipment to us.",
      "\"We were told the blood was too noisy on the lino [on the floor] - so that was literally about a sound effect.\"",
      "The other was \"a tussle\" over the use of the word bastard, a dated and offensive way of describing a child born to unmarried parents.",
      "Thomas says they had to do a bit of \"creative cutting\" to remove it.",
      "Amazingly, though, despite running pre-watershed, she hasn't had a single plotline censored or knocked back by the BBC.",
      "\"We've never had to compromise our style of storytelling, because it's set in Nonnatus House, \" she says, where the nuns and midwives live and share words of wisdom, along with tea and cake.",
      "\"We take emotional care of our audience, so even if we push them quite hard by showing them dark emotions or desperate circumstances, we bring them back to a place where they feel safe.\"",
      "She says the show challenges viewers by being \"emotionally graphic\".",
      "\"People often think graphic means blood sliding down the walls, but it can mean showing somebody in the pits of despair; interestingly, that's always permissible, even before the watershed.",
      "\"But even when our stories don't end happily, there is always a note of hope somewhere.\"",
      "Thomas has also managed to write endless fresh storylines, reflecting the health and social issues of the era.",
      "\"People ask me every year, 'Where do you get your stories from?'",
      "\"And the simple answer is, I go into the British Newspaper Archive, or I go into the medical archive, or people come up to me in the street.\"",
      "This is what made her decide to write about sexually transmitted diseases in the upcoming series in January.",
      "\"In the health report for Poplar [in London's East End], there was this brilliant description of how gonorrhea was getting out of control, and the Greater London Council instigated tracing teams of middle-aged women,\" she says.",
      "\"I just thought, 'this is Miss Higgins' - I love Miss Higgins.\"",
      "Miss Higgins, played by Georgie Glen, is the prim surgery receptionist with a poignant family backstory, which revealed her hidden strengths.",
      "\"I think all good drama takes you by surprise,\" Thomas says.",
      "\"The stories I choose to tell are the ones that grab me by the throat or the heart.",
      "\"I never know which organ is coming under pressure.",
      "\"But there's this kind of 'Wow' moment, when I see things that actually happened, and then that feeds into the fictional process of developing the drama.\"",
      "The show is also a family affair for Thomas, given her husband Stephen McGann plays a central character, GP Dr Patrick Turner.",
      "His recognisable face is often the reason the couple are approached in the street by fans, who don't always realise who Thomas is.",
      "\"He's always quick to say: \"'Oh, this is the lady who writes it',\" she says, \"and then they kind of go into a meltdown! I think some people don't realise we're married in real life.\"",
      "The series is broadcast in up to 200 global territories, although its biggest audience is in the US.",
      "She laughs as she recalls seeing the dubbed version of McGann on Italian TV while the couple were away on holiday there.",
      "\"They gave him a really deep, sexy laugh, out of all proportion to what he was saying - it was a lovely 'har har har'.\"",
      "Thomas, whose other writing work includes 2007 BBC period drama Cranford and 2017 mini-series Little Women, says despite how much of her life is entwined with the show, she still manages to keep home and work separate.",
      "She rarely goes on set during filming, and explains that McGann never sees the scripts before they're issued to the other actors.",
      "\"That was a decision I made to protect his integrity as an actor at an early stage,\" she says. \"But I think it's protected my writing space as well.\"",
      "She talks about the impact of the series abroad, including the stories it tells about illegal abortion.",
      "\"We've had requests from young American women to use clips from our show on their Instagram feeds, so they can warn their peers of what may happen if the laws in America are changed.",
      "\"You realise you are touching people's lives and perspectives in a very profound way.\"",
      "She also speaks about the importance of kindness, which is in abundance on the show, and about her brother David.",
      "He was born in 1970 with Down's syndrome and serious heart complications, and died in 1985.",
      "\"I've lived quite a long life now. I'm 62 and I grew up with quite a severely disabled brother, and that opened me to the goodness of people,\" she says.",
      "\"To the people who just met him as he was, accepted him as he was and loved him for what he was - that, at a very early, informative age, was my introduction to humanity,\" she says.",
      "\"And I honestly think that having somebody severely disabled at my side for the first 20 years of my life changed me for the good.\"",
      "The show's character Reggie Jackson, played by Daniel Laurie, who has Down's syndrome, had a big storyline in this year's Christmas specials, putting him at the heart of the show.",
      "Thomas ends by saying:  \"I think what this show is about, most of all, is love and kindness. It's about people doing their best.",
      "\"So I will carry on telling stories that show the better side of human nature.\"",

    "story": [
      "It's 2001 and nine-year-old Jonno Davies is standing in the crowd as Robbie Williams entertains 65,000 people at the Milton Keynes Bowl.",
      "\"He was just this symbol of cool, and that stuck with me for a long time... He was like the rock star of the day for me,\" he recalls.",
      "Now 32, Davies is appearing in cinemas around the world in Better Man, a musical biopic in which he plays his childhood hero.",
      "But he is far from recognisable, partly because of his hard work studying and recreating William's voice and mannerisms, but mostly because he's represented on screen as a computer-generated chimpanzee.",
      "\"I am the lead. I am Rob. Rob is me. Just with a monkey layering on top,\" he explains.",
      "Director Michael Gracey, who previously made The Greatest Showman, says the decision was inspired by conversations with Robbie Williams where he described himself as a performing monkey.",
      "On set, Davies was dressed in a performance capture suit, and later he was transformed into a primate by Weta FX - the same company behind Gollum in Lord of the Rings.",
      "Davies says: \"I play Rob from the age of 15 right the way through to the end of the film... It's full body, voice, dancing - the whole shebang.\"",
      "He adds: \"I feel the audience aren't watching it going: Do I believe that's him? Does that look enough like Robbie? Does that sound like Robbie? Because there's a monkey, we've already gone beyond that idea of comparison.",
      "\"It meant I didn't have to be vain. I wasn't looking at the monitor going 'Oh god, the double chin'... It was just about being truthful to the storyline.\"",
      "That said the actor says his face can be seen for a \"tiny split second\" at the very end of the film: \"Kudos to anyone that actually sees that.\"",
      "The Chesterfield-born actor was cast as the Angels singer about a week before production was due to begin.",
      "Actor Kate Mulvany, who plays Williams' mother Jane, suggested Davies after having worked with him on the Amazon Prime series Hunters.",
      "When The Greatest Showman director phoned Davies inviting him to audition, the actor was working a \"side hustle\" performing at children's parties as PT Barnum - Hugh Jackman's character from the film.",
      "He recalls: \"I was kind of going 'Okay, this is a weird but wonderful turn of events'\".",
      "Auditions took place in Australia, where he ran scenes with Raechelle Banno who plays All Saints singer Nicole Appleton in the film.",
      "He recalls: \"I thought I mucked it up. Then a few hours later [Gracey] called me into his office and he said 'look we'd love you to play Robbie'.",
      "\"You know, you dream of these roles. You dream to lead productions like this, to be in such huge scale films. But as soon as that penny drops, and you know that you are actually the one to do it, there's a sense of pressure.",
      "\"They're gonna actually find out that I'm rubbish. And all this time I've just been sort of lucking through it. And that's actually something that Rob feels a lot. And so, it was a really useful connection for me to have.\"",
      "In 2022, Davies is rehearsing for a scene on stage at the Royal Albert Hall when Williams, who he has not met yet, is in the audience.",
      "\"I was about to sing and in he steps, plonks himself in the middle of the front row,\" the actor says.",
      "\"Wow that's Robbie Williams, that's who I'm playing, don't mess it up. I probably did because voice was going and knees were buckling.\"",
      "He didn't mess it up. Not according to Williams himself who describes the performer as a \"fantastic human being\".",
      "The musician says: \"He's such a lovely person, and he's immensely talented. Watching him do his thing \u2013 which is my thing \u2013 was very interesting, confusing, wonderful, and a weird thing to watch. He's amazing.\"",
      "Davies, who grew up in Milton Keynes, attended Bedford School between 2001 and 2010.",
      "While attending he took part in musical productions of  Bugsy Malone, Fiddler on the Roof and History Boys.",
      "He says: \"If it wasn't for Bedford School, I don't think I would've become an actor.",
      "\"I was applying for university and our head of drama approached me and said 'I don't think this is what you want to be, you want to be an actor'.",
      "\"Having somebody say that really made me think it might be a possibility... I think a lot of people had that support, it wasn't just a one off.\"",
      "Now the actor's name is on one of the seats at the school's theatre and he likes to return to visit the pupils.",
      "\"Anything I feel that I can learn I'd love to pass on to them,\" he says.",
      "\"Maybe we can do like a motion capture day somehow. Do some animal studies, as it were.\"",
      "In the same year he started at Bedford School he went with his parents to watch Robbie Williams play at Milton Keynes Bowl.",
      "\"I was just looking at the epitome of cool strutting about, giving it large,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I just thought that is someone that exudes confidence and I kind of want to be a bit like that.",
      "\"So, then meeting him, working with him on this piece, and then being the one to have the privilege of playing him- it's nuts how life can kind of come around in weird circles.\"",

    "story": [
      "Money, success, power, beauty - it often seems as if celebrities have everything they could possibly want.",
      "So it's just as well they also get tangled up in their fair share of mishaps, blunders and own goals every year.",
      "Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.",
      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",
      "Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due a backstage incident where a woman's video camera was knocked to the ground.",
      "Winner Nemo even accidentally broke the Eurovision trophy after placing it on stage, leaving the Swiss entrant with bandages after sustaining deep cuts to the thumb.",
      "Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\".",
      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",

      "When one fan affectionately edited a promotional poster for Wicked to resemble the musical's original Broadway illustration, actress Cynthia Erivo said it erased her contribution to the film, because her eyes were hidden under her witch's hat.",
      "A barrage of memes followed as fans lightly poked fun at her reaction, with many social media users jokingly trying to avoid any further erasure by attaching pictures of Erivo to posts which had nothing to do with her.",
      "The original fan clarified that the altered film promo was intended to be \"an innocent fan edit to pay homage to the original Broadway poster\".",
      "But Erivo handled the backlash like a pro, making light of the situation and telling ET: \u201cFor me it was just like a human moment of wanting to protect little Elphaba. I probably should have called my friends.\"",
      "14. Rishi in the rain",
      "When Rishi Sunak called a general election in May, the then-prime minister made the announcement outdoors despite it bucketing with rain.",
      "Being in the open air also allowed an anti-Tory activist to disrupt the announcement by blasting music from a nearby speaker.",

      "So fair play to Kate Nash for not only keeping her show on the road, but funding her tour by selling pictures of her bottom online, helpfully bringing publicity to the issues of high tour costs and poor streaming royalties in the process.",

      "But to her horror, it transpired her new beau had murdered not only his ex-wife but also Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), as well as attempting to kill Gail's own mum Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire).",
      "Gail, with a now legendary line, branded Richard as \"Norman Bates with a briefcase\", a reference to the serial killer in classic Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.",
      "She then ended the marriage, which led to Richard kidnapping her, her son David, Sarah and Bethany with the intention of killing them all.",
      "An audience of more than 19 million watched the story reach its climax as he drove her and her family into a canal... killing only himself.",
      "Christmas Eve's episode ended with Gail receiving a visit from a certain ghost of Christmas past.",
      "4. That fight with Eileen Grimshaw",
      "In 2004, angry at how Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) was treating her daughter Sarah, Gail found herself embroiled in a fight with his mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver) that spilled out on to the street.",
      "Having yelled at both Todd and Eileen, Gail goaded the latter into slapping her, before all (hair-pulling) hell broke loose.",
      "When Eileen's other son Jason (Ryan Thomas) arrived on the scene from work, still wearing a hard hat, Gail declared: \"Here they are, the rest of the Village People!\"",
      "As the decades rolled on, the feud continued - but for a respectful ceasefire - with each woman aiming digs at the other about their respective love lives.",
      "It exploded again properly in 2015 when the pair argued over the affections of Gail's fifth husband Michael (Les Dennis).",
      "Cleaver confirmed to the BBC that they had \"never pulled each other's hair\" or \"punched or slapped each other\" in real life, and had in fact been good friends for many years.",
      "\"I think there's going to be a huge hole left by Helen leaving,\" she said. \"We've finished filming and you can feel her absence.",
      "\"You're just so used to seeing her, that twinkly-eyed little lady who's just a ball of joy, she's going to be hugely missed.",
      "\"I mean, that character - she's such an icon. She's one of the last greats.\"",
      "Eileen was not the only Weatherfield woman to be on the receiving end of Gail's anger when defending her family.",
      "In 2010, the tempestous but loyal Gail had an aggresive food fight with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) after Deirdre was found to have kissed the partner of Gail's mum, Audrey.",
      "\"Ken, do something!\" exclaimed a cake-splattered Deidre.",
      "5. Falsely imprisoned for murder",
      "In 2010, Gail got married again, this time to Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale).",
      "This one wasn't any happier in the end, though, as he decided he was going to fake his own death due to debts.",
      "But he accidentally drowned for real on a boat trip, leading to his new wife being arrested for murder after witnesses said they'd seen the couple arguing (about his aforementioned plan).",
      "In prison, troublemaker Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) lied that her cellmate Gail had confessed to killing Joe.",
      "Luckily for one of the street's most downtrodden characters, Gail was found not guilty and released.",
      "6. Helping her son deal with his wife's death",
      "Gail had her troubles with son David (Jack P. Shepherd) as well, once accusing him of delibrately causing \"fear and misery to everyone in this family\".",
      "\"We've had sleepless nights,\" she added dramatically. \"I'm on pills, for God's sake!\"",
      "By 2016, David was a married man himself. However, that came to a tragic end when his wife Kylie (Paula Lane) was stabbed to death, dying in David's arms.",
      "Gail's motherly advice was for him to be honest with his own children about what had happened.",
      "In a heart-rending, tear-filled scene, she recalled the day she had struggled to tell her eldest son Nick (nowadays Ben Price) the truth about his dad Brian being killed, explaining that the boy had been left scarred.",
      "\"It was just about the worst conversation of my life,\" Gail told David, with a wry laugh to break the tension. \"And it's had some competition.\"",
      "Price told the BBC that while his on-screen mum's big storylines \"were great\", he would miss the \"beautiful bits in between\" with her the most.",

      "\"Those moments, for me, were Corrie and were gold.",
      "\"They make me smile.\"",
      "7. Gail's moving monologue",
      "In 2018, Gail powerfully expressed the shock and grief of Weatherfield residents following the devastating suicide of factory boss Aidan Connor.",
      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",
      "\"And yet [she was saying], if you did know everybody's business then you would have seen this coming.\"",
      "The powerful scene was nominated for Bafta's Must See Moment award.",

    "story": [
      "Actress Blake Lively was arguably the internet's public enemy number one for a couple of weeks in the summer. She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",
      "\"You know we can bury anyone,\" Nathan wrote to Abel in one damning discussion.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Actor Baldoni women's solidarity award rescinded amid allegations",
      "Now, the people hired to do crisis PR for Baldoni are doing crisis PR for themselves.",
      "Abel has said Lively's lawyers \"cherry picked\" messages to include in their case without crucial context, and that there was \"no 'smear' implemented\".",
      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",
      "In recent days, Lively has received support from a string of former co-stars and others in Hollywood.",
      "The name of one of her supporters stands out.",
      "Amber Heard, former wife of Johnny Depp, told NBC: \"Social media is the absolute personification of the classic saying, 'A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.'",
      "\"I saw this firsthand and up close. It's as horrifying as it is destructive.\"",
      "Heard was on the receiving end of social media hostility during two high-profile libel trials involving Depp in the UK and US in 2020 and 2022. Nathan also reportedly worked for Depp.",
      "Freedman responded to Heard by saying the only connection between her and Lively was that \"for decades every move they have made has been out there for everyone to see\" so the public could \"make up their own minds - which they did, organically\".",
      "Tortoise Media head of investigations Alexi Mostrous, who hosted a podcast called Who Trolled Amber? earlier this year examining the abuse she received, said there were parallels.",
      "\"In both the Blake Lively case and the Amber Heard case, you see PR companies working with digital media specialists and other 'contractors' to promote online stories beneficial to their wealthy clients in ways that are opaque and not well understood,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It's an unregulated world where all sorts of tactics can take place behind closed doors.\"",
      "'Common tactic'",
      "Variety said Lively's case \"lays bare a show business process that's meant to operate in the shadows \u2013 the hiring of expensive crisis communications experts to sway opinion and uplift clients\".",
      "Her allegations suggest a \"sinister shadow campaign\" that went \"beyond what most publicity firms in Hollywood see as acceptable\", The Wrap's Sharon Waxman wrote.",
      "According to Rory Lynch, partner and head of reputation management law at Gateley Legal, it is \"quite a common tactic\" in Hollywood and business disputes to \"have PRs on both sides planting negative stories, sometimes false stories, about the opposition\".",
      "\"Even back in the golden era of Hollywood, there were rumours that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were using PR professionals to negatively brief against each other.\"",
      "However, the PR people who worked for Baldoni and his studio \"dropped the ball a little bit\" by discussing tactics in texts, he told BBC News.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me, especially in the US and Hollywood, that you've got quite aggressive crisis PR people.",
      "\"But the fact that they put that in writing, I think, was possibly not the wisest thing. Normally they might do something like that over the phone.\"",
      "Lively herself is \"a sophisticated operator\" who will \"have her own PR people working away in the background as well\", Lynch added.",
      "'Our eyes are open'",
      "The New York Times, which broke the story of Lively's complaint at the weekend, said she \"denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer\".",
      "The paper also pointed out that \"it is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity\" towards Lively was originally seeded by those working on behalf of Baldoni, \"and how much they noticed and amplified\".",
      "Some fans have stressed that their criticisms were genuine, but many who turned against Lively now see the situation in a different light.",

      "Kapranos and wife Clara Luciani welcomed their first child last year, and the 52-year-old told BBC Scotland News departing on tours with his band is now \"really difficult.\"",
      "\"Saying goodbye to him is hard,\" says the singer, speaking as his band prepare to release their sixth album, The Human Fear, in January.",
      "\"I've spent my adult life shirking responsibility, and being as irresponsible as possible, so being presented with responsibility is quite refreshing.",
      "\"A lot of people said to me that sleep deprivation would destroy me, but it was just like 2004 when the band was kicking off and I never went to bed.",
      "\"We'd be playing gigs, going out all night and then be up at 6am to fly somewhere. I slept about two hours a night back then, so this is the same - just without a hangover.\"",
      "Kapranos will be forced to say goodbye on a few occasions as 2025 goes on, with a busy year in store for Franz \u2013 now revamped and reformatted since those early days, but still adept at writing artful indie pop.",
      "Emerging from Glasgow's bustling music scene Kapranos, guitarist Nick McCarthy, bassist Bob Hardy and drummer Paul Thomson enjoyed chart success with inescapable singles like Take Me Out, earned a reputation as one of the country's finest live acts and snagged the Mercury Music Prize in 2004.",
      "That victory came as the band thought \"anyone but us would win,\" recalls the singer.",
      "\"It's quite a Glasgow attitude. You're like 'we're not the sort of people who win prizes'.\"",
      "Success had taken time to arrive.",
      "Kapranos was born in England but moved to to Scotland as a child. As a teenager he became entrenched in the 90s Glasgow music scene, running club nights and playing in the likes of cult indie band the Yummy Fur before forming Franz Ferdinand.",
      "Much has changed since their debut album won the Mercury, with The Human Fear marking the group's first studio offering since the exit of original drummer Thomson in 2021.",
      "Guitarist McCarthy had left in 2016.",
      "A new line-up has formed around original members Kapranos and Hardy, with guitarist Dino Bardot, keyboardist/guitarist Julian Corrie and drummer Audrey Tait joining up.",
      "Kapranos believes the band's identity is intact despite the changes.",
      "\"Whenever we do a cover it always sounds like us, and I like that.  We did Good Luck Babe [by Chappell Roan] on Radio 2, which is an amazing song but when we play it, it just sounds like Franz Ferdinand.",
      "\"Bob and I were talking about this before we made this record, that it's good to be at ease with your identity and your sound.",
      "\"Knowing your voice and who you are is important. You could listen to early Birthday Party records and then those dark sombre ballads Nick Cave has been writing now, and it's still unmistakeably him -it's the same for PJ Harvey or Leonard Cohen.",
      "\"That really informed us making this record.  I wanted people to listen to this and know it's unmistakeably Franz Ferdinand.\"",
      "A greatest hits compilation in 2021 and ensuing tour helped the singer make \"peace with everything that we've done before\".",
      "\"I'm not the kinda person who likes to look back,\" he adds.",
      "\"Once we make a record I never really listen to it again, so for the tour I was being forced to listen to that music again, and I found I felt pretty comfortable with it.\"",
      "Celebrating the past meant the band were also eager to try new things for the future.",
      "The Human Fear is filled with ideas fresh to the group, from orchestral flourishes on recent single Audacious to a bouzouki being used on Black Eyelashes and the Celtic style riff pulsing through Cats.",
      "Exhilaration of fear",
      "However, while the title might suggest a record bubbling with dread, Kapranos says it's about the opposite.",
      "\"The greatest moments in life are when you overcome fear,\" he says, admitting his own childhood terror was the shark in Jaws.",
      "\"Watching horror films or riding rollercoasters gives you a buzz and we should maybe approach some wider existential fears with the same attitude.",
      "\"I remember growing up in the 80s and thinking one diplomatic slip-up would mean we'd all be nuclear toast. There's always something to be afraid of, and you can either submit to it or stand up to it.\"",
      "'Loathe' to write about politics again",
      "Politics is something Franz Ferdinand have visited before. In 2014 they backed Scottish independence and two years later they released Demagogue, aimed at the then incoming American President Donald Trump.",
      "However the second Presidency of Trump is unlikely to spur such a similiar reaction.",
      "\"Trump's not my favourite man and there's so much in worldwide politics that's disheartening,\" says the singer.",

      "\"Some of my friends on social media just bang on about it all the time. The arts is a powerful tool of protest and we should continue to do that, but there's a difference between that and low key whinging.\"",
      "They won't remain silent on some issues, though.",

      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",
      "The podcast bills itself as creating \"a safe environment\" for exploring issues such as how \"masculinity\" shows up in relationships, as well as \"sex, success\" and \"mental health\".",

    "summary": "Never-before-seen home video footage, filmed by Sir Roger Moore, is revealed in a new BBC documentary.",
    "story": [
      "He had a licence to charm on screen, with his sultry voice and suave, chiselled good looks. But in private, actor Sir Roger Moore - who played James Bond in seven films - was equally as comfortable behind the camera.",
      "A new BBC documentary to air on Christmas Day will reveal never-before-seen home video footage, filmed by Sir Roger himself, of his family and very famous friends - including actor Kirk Douglas and singer Olivia Newton-John.",
      "A young Sir Elton John is also spotted descending from the skies in a helicopter ready for lunch with Sir Roger and other celebrity guests - the likes of Joan Collins and David Attenborough.",
      "Sir Roger's son Geoffrey, who found the old video cassettes in the cupboards and garage at his family's home in Switzerland, remembers the gathering in France well.",
      "He played a game of tennis with Sir Elton, he recalls, in an exclusive interview for BBC News, before the singer flew off to Cannes to film the music video for his hit song, I'm Still Standing.",
      "Sir Roger also got behind the camera to film much more intimate occasions with his three children - Geoffrey, Deborah and Christian - and their mother, his third wife, Italian actress Luisa Mattioli.",
      "Bringing the memories of the past back to life again on screen proved poignant for Geoffrey and his siblings.",
      "\"I think the way he was just filming was as any father would film his children. It was just a family guy recording, documenting a time,\" says Geoffrey.",
      "\"I think it was also because [the camera] was a new toy, so he wanted to use it.\"",
      "Growing up, being surrounded by stars from the silver screen was normal for Geoffrey.",
      "\"I mean [Frank] Sinatra was very close to the family and we used to spend a lot of Thanksgivings and Easters together. Kirk Douglas, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, they were all very, very dear friends.\"",
      "Sir Roger's daughter Deborah remembers her father couldn't keep up with Frank Sinatra's drinking and would secretly pour his whisky into the plant pots.",
      "The family would watch comedy duo Morecambe and Wise on TV on a Friday night, says Geoffrey, and then Eric and Ernie would come over for Sunday lunch.",
      "He also remembers meeting Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery - the first James Bond - as well as stars from Hollywood's golden age, such as Fred Astaire and Olivia De Havilland.",
      "\"I mean, if I think about how lucky we were\u2026 to the point where even Roger would say, 'Goodness, look at that, we've got Gene Kelly sitting there. Isn't that wonderful!'\".",
      "But despite being surrounded by stardom, Sir Roger was very \"self-deprecating\", says Geoffrey.",
      "\"I always say, the bigger the talent, the smaller the limousine. And he was incredibly humble,\" he says.",
      "At the end of a day's filming, Sir Roger would simply enjoy watching TV with his family in his dressing gown and slippers.",
      "\"His treat was baked beans on toast,\" says Geoffrey. \"He didn't need caviar.\"",
      "Sir Roger came from humble beginnings. He grew up in Stockwell in south London. His father was a police officer and his mother worked in a tearoom. He crafted his aristocratic English accent at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and earned money modelling knitting patterns.",
      "His big break came in 1962, playing Simon Templar in the TV series, The Saint.",
      "Geoffrey recalls the phone call his father received when he found out he had been chosen to take over the role of Britain's most famous secret agent.",
      "The last three digits of Sir Roger's phone number just happened to be 007.",
      "\"He answered the phone with '007', because that's what you do, and the voice said, 'That you are Roger,'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "Sean Connery was the closest to author Ian Fleming's depiction of the character in his spy novels, says Geoffrey, as in \"I'm going to sleep with you and kill your boss tomorrow\".",
      "\"Whereas, Roger didn't want to fire a gun really,\" says Geoffrey, \"he just sort of killed them with charm.\"",
      "He always had a very sardonic approach, says Geoffrey, and that was his interpretation, he adds.",
      "\"Let's make James Bond Roger Moore,\" he says, \"[as] opposed to Roger having to play a hired gun who is licensed to kill. And I think he was more like 'licensed to thrill.'\"",
      "This took an enormous amount of talent, says Geoffrey.",
      "Of the Bond films that starred Sir Roger, Geoffrey says his father's favourite was The Spy Who Loved Me.",
      "Growing up on movie sets was fantastic, recalls Geoffrey, but having James Bond as your father attracted quite a bit of attention on the school run.",
      "When Sir Roger came to pick him up from school one day, he remembers the car was suddenly surrounded by pupils - keen to catch a glimpse of the star.",
      "\"I thought, 'Oh, okay, he's known, I'm not the only one that sees him on the box,'\" he says.",
      "But living in the public eye could be difficult when there was a scandal.",
      "Geoffrey recalls a phone call his father made to him one morning, letting him know the papers had got hold of the story that he was leaving his mother.",
      "\"I said, 'Well, thanks for the heads up! How long have I got?'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "The press had already surrounded his mother's house. It creates \"a small scar to see that your pain is exposed,\" says Geoffrey. \"I think that's the worst part of being famous.\"",
      "After his split from Luisa, Sir Roger went on to marry his fourth wife, Kristina Tholstrup, otherwise known as Kiki. He had also been previously married to actress and professional ice skater Doorn van Steyn and singer Dorothy Squires.",
      "Sir Roger died in 2017 at the age of 89. In his later years, actress Audrey Hepburn had asked him to take on her humanitarian work for the children's charity Unicef, says Geoffrey.",
      "\"It says a lot about his love for humanity, his love for children. And that, I think, is probably his greatest role.\"",

    "summary": "Carnival attractions created by artists Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat and David Hockney are now on display in New York.",
    "story": [
      "Children played on fairground rides designed by the world's greatest artists for a single summer before they disappeared for decades.",
      "The attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.",
      "Visitors could wander Roy Lichtenstein's hall of mirrors and marvel at Salvador Dali's fun dome, sampling biscuits decorated by artist Gertie Fr\u00f6lich as actors dressed as nuns and flamingos milled about.",
      "A successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.",
      "Until now.",
      "Luna Luna is unwrapped",
      "American entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.",
      "\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"",
      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",
      "Decades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen.",
      "His key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.",
      "\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.",
      "The New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.",
      "When he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.",
      "\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.",
      "It was a sleepless night.",
      "But the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.",
      "The return of Luna Luna",
      "Unearthing the artwork wasn't the hardest part of Luna Luna's revival.",
      "Brad Gooch, author of recent official Haring biography, Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, saw Luna Luna being reconstructed, describing the feat as \"mind boggling.\"",
      "\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.",
      "A crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.",
      "Now, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process.",
      "Alex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"",
      "\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added.",
      "Most of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s.",
      "Hockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.",
      "Goldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space.",
      "Drake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.",
      "All the fun of the fair?",
      "There's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.",
      "Basquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.",
      "Haring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.",
      "\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"",
      "Poots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"",
      "But he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\".",
      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",
      "He added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".",
      "Among the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.",
      "Haring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".",
      "The show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed."

    "story": [
      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",

      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",
      "Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"",
      "7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee",
      "A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",
      "Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\"",
      "Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"",
      "8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood",
      "On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.",
      "Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\"",
      "Consequence of Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"",
      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",
      "10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet",
      "Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.",

      "Other women said they had waited more than a year to see specialists and could not afford to go private.",

      "Then the pandemic hit and she lost her job. Aged 25, she had to move back in with her parents in Watford.",
      "She decided to start a skincare brand, despite knowing nothing about the industry. It was a big success until one wrong business decision, which triggered her trichotillomania - a hair-pulling disorder that meant she could not resist the urge to pull out her eyelashes.",

      "After losing my job, I decided to throw myself into it. For the first year and a half of the business, I was running around like a headless chicken. I didn't have a business plan. I didn't know who my target audience was. I didn't know anything. I set up a website and just chipped away at it day by day.",
      "A lot of people doubted me. I look back now and I'm proud I had the balls to ignore them. I was just so excited by the idea. But at the same time I knew I needed a steady income. I ended up starting a job as a project manager at the Ministry of Defence and I thought my business would just be a side hustle.",
      "Then in January 2021, when I started posting on Tiktok, things just blew up and I quit my new full-time job. In the first few months, I went from zero to 50,000 followers and I generated \u00a310,000 in sales, which was double what I had done in the whole six months prior.",

Everyone was on their phones and people had more disposable income but then life went back to normal. It was almost like a perfect storm for e-commerce businesses. But then sales really stagnated.",
      "So I decided to spend the remaining \u00a38,000 of the company's cash on advertising but I didn't see a return from that. I had to reinvest my own savings back into the business because I had nothing but I still had people to pay and bills coming out.",
      "It was a really difficult time, and it triggered my trichotillomania, which is an uncontrollable urge to pull out body hair. I've had it since I was 14 but thought it had gone away.",
      "For me it's a feeling that there's an eyelash that needs to be pulled out and it's a relief when you do that. I couldn't stop doing it. But then you feel guilt and shame and it's a never ending cycle.",
      "I decided maybe it was time to quit my business, I was so frustrated and I felt like it had consumed my whole life. I did this post on TikTok explaining my situation and it got two million views.",

      "I was using eyelash serums to try and grow my lashes back but my eyes were getting really sore and red. I realised some of the serums on the market contain a synthetic growth hormone. So I created a lash oil made from natural plant seed oils and people started commenting asking if they could buy it.",
      "By the time I launched it, I had 5,000 people on the waiting list. The lash oil is now my best-selling product, and makes up around 80% of my sales, it has sold out six or seven times and has generated \u00a3400,000 in sales since I launched it last summer.",

      "I firmly believe there is a link between doing your skin care and looking after yourself properly to help relieve depression and anxiety. Also most people living with skin conditions find their mental health and wellbeing suffers as a result, so the two things are definitely related.",

I'm also working as a business coach and mentor now and I love helping other young people who are starting out, because I didn't know what I was doing when I started. I tell them everything I wish I had known at the start. I just love helping people, it's a really good feeling.",

      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",

      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

      "Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted she will not be rushed into policy positions, claiming there is no \"quick fix\" following the party's defeat in July's general election.",
      "Badenoch became the party's sixth leader in less than nine years when she was elected at the start of November.",
      "In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said the public \"kicked out\" the Conservatives because the party was not trusted and did not deliver, adding building trust is \"something that takes a while\".",
      "Badenoch also dismissed concerns that her approach of not pinning down policy positions could leave a vacuum that might be filled by Reform UK.",
      "Speaking to Amol Rajan, Badenoch said: \"Reform is saying stuff because it hasn't thought it all through. You can give easy answers if you haven't thought it all through.",
      "\"I do the thinking and what people are going to get with new leadership under me is thoughtful Conservatism, not knee-jerk analysis.\"",
      "\"We are about what we are for, not just what we are against,\" she said earlier in the interview.",

      "The new government has focused on tackling the criminal gangs involved in people smuggling, with Sir Keir announcing an extra \u00a375m to go to policing UK borders in November.",

      "Dr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, previously told BBC News: \"For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go [and] visit it.",

      "It was protected by an 11.5cm (4.5in) thick carbon-composite shield, but the spacecraft's tactic was to get in and out fast.",
      "In fact, it moved faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.",
      "Parker's speed came from the immense gravitational pull it felt as it fell towards the Sun.",

    "summary": "A blurring of the distinctions between seasons is also a challenge for insects and their predators.",
    "story": [
      "Storms and flooding have damaged some of the UK's most precious heritage, according to the National Trust - the UK's biggest conservation charity.",
      "It says extreme weather is taking a toll on the estates it manages in England and Wales, with many mature trees brought down and flooding damaging buildings and gardens.",
      "Warm, wet conditions have prevailed this year and that has brought problems too, the Trust says in its annual roundup of how the weather and climate has affected its vast holdings of land and property.",
      "It says increasing \"homogenisation\" is blurring distinctions between the seasons, which can be challenging for many insect species and the predators that depend on them.",
      "In January, Avebury Manor, a Tudor manor house in Wiltshire, flooded for the first time in 300 years after a series of named storms barrelled into the country. It was one of a number of properties that suffered as Storm Henk was followed by Storms Isha and Jocelyn.",
      "Many of the Trust's properties are not designed to endure the extreme winds and rain storms like this bring. Some buildings still have antique drainpipes and guttering -  often an important design feature - which can overflow in heavy rain, sometimes damaging interiors as well as exteriors.",
      "Later-blooming bluebells",
      "April was cool and wet which meant many flowering plants, including bluebells, flowered later than usual - like these fine examples at Walk Wood in Sheffield Park and Garden in East Sussex.",
      "Many domestic gardens will also have seen plants bloom a little late, but once they got going most should have performed well, helped by the plentiful moisture which kept many plants strong.",
      "The erratic spring weather disrupted some wildlife species including the rare Adonis blue butterfly. Charity The Butterfly Trust says only 333 examples of this dramatic creature were recorded in one area of west Dorset \u2013 a stronghold of the species \u2013 compared to 1,459 in 2023.",
      "Many bee, wasp and moth species also recorded very low numbers.",
      "\"Our unpredictable weather is resulting in confusion for our wildlife and the slow loss of what once were 'predictable' seasons,\" said Keith Jones, the Climate Change Advisor at the National Trust.",
      "The rainy weather helped re-wet peatland ecosystems across the country after two years of very dry weather in 2022 and into 2023. Rare dragonflies were sighted on various bogland ecosystems, including this female Scare Chaser dragonfly at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire.",
      "Many trees benefited too. Young saplings need moisture to build strong root systems, and the wet weather also relieved stress in some older trees which had been suffering during the parched weather.",
      "There was another good news story on the Suffolk coast. Rangers at the Orford Ness National Nature Reserve announced the establishment of the county's first grey seal colony. The seals are believed to have set up home on the secluded beach at Orford Ness because of the low risk of disturbance, and also because thriving colonies up the coast at Blakeney and Horsey Gap have become crowded.",
      "Seal colony thriving 'thanks to secluded site'",
      "Continued warm weather meant autumn came late this year, but it brought an explosion of colour with some spectacular displays ranging from gold through to russet red, like here on the Wallington Estate in Northumberland.",
      "The lack of frost and wet soils meant many trees kept their leaves well into November, a month longer than usual. But autumn displays were brought to an abrupt end in the second half of the month when a cold snap followed by Storm Bert stripped trees of leaves in just a couple of days.",
      "Why are this year's autumn colours so late?",
      "The mild and wet autumn was great for many species of fungi. Gardeners will have noticed that other moisture-loving creatures - including slugs and snails - thrived too. In the picture above, a leopard slug is eating a false deathcap mushroom on the Blickling Estate in Norfolk.",
      "These last few weeks have seen yet more changeable weather with temperatures seesawing from freezing to balmy in a matter of days. These camelias burst into bloom on 20 November at Glendurgan Garden in Cornwall."

      "The sanctuary is under quarantine and is closed to the public to prevent the spread of the virus, the statement said.",
      "The animals died between late November and mid-December, the sanctuary's director, Mark Mathews, told the New York Times.",
      "\"We've never had anything like it; they usually die basically of old age,\" he said. \"Not something like this, it's a pretty wicked virus.\"",
      "The news comes as bird flu continues to spread among cattle and poultry in the US, while also severely infecting at least one human.",
      "The sanctuary said it had lost five African serval cats, four bobcats, two Canada lynx and a Bengal tiger, among others.  Only 17 cats now remain at the Center.",
      "\"Cats are particularly vulnerable to this virus, which can cause subtle initial symptoms but progress rapidly, often resulting in death within 24 hours due to pneumonia-like conditions,\" the sanctuary said in its Facebook statement on Friday.",
      "Bird flu has long infected poultry flocks in the US. But the virus began to infect cattle in the US for the first time in March.",
      "And since April 2024, there have been a total of 61 human cases of bird flu reported in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "Walking campaigners have welcomed the announcement but the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said removing the deadline would mean claims would \"continue to disrupt many farm businesses for years to come\".",
      "Legislation requiring local authorities to create a \"definitive map\" showing public rights of way in their area was passed in 1949.",
      "But the documents have been kept under continuous review, meaning anyone with appropriate evidence could apply for a path to be added.",
      "There are estimated to be more than 40,000 miles of rights of way in England which are not officially recorded.",
      "The previous Conservative government had also planned to scrap the cut off date for historic paths to be registered but later decided to extend it from 2026 to 2031, saying this would provide more certainty for landowners, councils and users.",
      "But the Local Government Association said financial pressures had left councils with limited resources to process applications, making the 2031 deadline \"a tall order unlikely to be met\".",
      "Research by the BBC found that as of March this year, nearly 8,000 requests for paths to be added to the official map were waiting to be processed.",
      "'There will be many footpaths simply lost'",
      "Public rights of way blocked in 32,000 places",
      "Once a right of way has been established, the local authority and landowner are legally responsible for maintaining it.",

    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",

The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",

      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",

      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",

    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 23:53:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The killings have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse.",
    "story": [
      "\"The Chinese people are so miserable,\" read a social media post in the wake of yet another mass killing in the country earlier this year. The same user also warned: \"There will only be more and more copycat attacks.\"",
      "\"This tragedy reflects the darkness within society,\" wrote another.",
      "Such bleak assessments, following a spate of deadly incidents in China during 2024, have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse to \"take revenge on society\".",
      "Attacks like this are still rare given China's huge population, and are not new, says David Schak, associate professor at Griffith University in Australia. But they seem to come in waves, often as copycat attempts at garnering attention.",
      "This year has been especially distressing.",
      "From 2019 to 2023, police recorded three to five cases each year, where perpetrators attacked pedestrians or strangers.",
      "In 2024, that number jumped to 19.",
      "In 2019, three people were killed and 28 injured in such incidents; in 2023, 16 dead and 40 injured and in 2024, 63 people killed and 166 injured. November was especially bloody.",
      "On the 11th of that month, a 62-year-old man ploughed a car into people exercising outside a stadium in the city of Zhuhai, killing at least 35. Police said that the driver had been unhappy with his divorce settlement. He was sentenced to death this week.",
      "Days later, in Changde city, a man drove into a crowd of children and parents outside a primary school, injuring 30 of them. The authorities said he was angry over financial losses and family problems.",
      "That same week, a 21-year-old who couldn't graduate after failing his exams, went on a stabbing rampage on his campus in Wuxi city, killing eight and injuring 17.",
      "In September, a 37-year-old man raced through a Shanghai shopping centre, stabbing people as he went. In June, four American instructors were attacked at a park by a 55-year-old man wielding a knife. And there were two separate attacks on Japanese citizens, including one in which a 10-year-old boy was stabbed to death outside his school.",
      "The perpetrators have largely targeted \"random people\" to show their \"displeasure with society\", Prof Schak says.",
      "In a country with vast surveillance capabilities, where women rarely hesitate to walk alone at night, these killings have sparked understandable unease.",
      "So what has prompted so many mass attacks in China this year?",
      "China's slowing economy",
      "A major source of pressure in China right now is the sluggish economy. It is no secret that the country has been struggling with high youth unemployment, massive debt and a real estate crisis which has consumed the life savings of many families, sometimes with nothing to show for it.",
      "On the outskirts of most major cities there are entire housing estates where construction has stopped because indebted developers cannot afford to complete them. In 2022, the BBC interviewed people camping in the concrete shells of their own unfinished apartments, without running water, electricity and windows because they had nowhere else to stay.",
      "Xi Jinping is worried about the economy - what do Chinese people think?",
      "A Japanese boy was killed in China. Was cyber-nationalism to blame?",
      "\"Optimism certainly does seem to have faded,\" says George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University's China Centre. \"Let's use the word trapped, just for the moment. I think China has become trapped in a sort of cycle of repression. Social repression and economic repression, on the one hand, and a kind of faltering economic development model on the other.\"",
      "Studies appear to point to a significant change in attitudes, with a measurable increase in pessimism among Chinese people about their personal prospects. A significant US-China joint analysis, which for years had recorded them saying that inequality in society could often be attributed to a lack of effort or ability, found in its most recent survey that people were now blaming an \"unfair economic system\".",
      "\"The question is who do people really blame?\" Mr Magnus asks. \"And the next step from that is that the system is unfair to me, and I can't break through. I can't change my circumstances.\"",
      "A lack of options",
      "In countries with a healthy media, if you felt you had been fired from your job unfairly or that your home had been demolished by corrupt builders backed by local officials, you might turn to journalists for your story to be heard. But that is rarely an option in China, where the press is controlled by the Communist Party and unlikely to run stories which reflect badly on any level of the government.",
      "Then there are the courts \u2013 also run by and for the party \u2013 which are slow and inefficient.  Much was made on social media here of the Zhuhai attacker's alleged motive: that he did not achieve what he believed was a fair divorce settlement in court.",
      "Experts say other outlets for venting frustrations have also narrowed or been shut down altogether.",
      "Chinese people often air their grievances online, says Lynette Ong, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, who has carried out significant research on how the Chinese state responds to push back from its people.",
      "\"[They] will go on to the internet and scold the government\u2026 just to vent their anger. Or they may organise a small protest which the police would often allow if it's small-scale,\" she explains. \"But this sort of dissent, small dissent, has been closed off in the last couple of years.\"",
      "There are plenty of examples of this: Increased internet censorship, which blocks words or expressions that are deemed controversial or critical; crackdowns on cheeky Halloween costumes that make fun of officialdom; or when plain-clothed men, who appeared to have been mobilised by local officials, beat up protesters in Henan province outside banks which had frozen their accounts.",
      "As for dealing with people's mental and emotional responses to these stresses, this too has been found wanting. Specialists say that China's counselling services are vastly inadequate, leaving no outlet for those who feel isolated, alone and depressed in modern Chinese society.",
      "\"Counselling can help build up emotional resilience,\" says Professor Silvia Kwok from Hong Kong's City University, adding that China needs to increase its mental health services, especially for at-risk groups who have experienced trauma or those with mental illness.",
      "\"People need to find different strategies or constructive ways to deal with their emotions\u2026 making them less likely to react violently in moments of intense emotional stress.\"",
      "Taken together, these factors suggest the lid is tightening on Chinese society, creating a pressure cooker-like situation.",
      "\"There are not a lot of people going around mass killing. But still the tensions do seem to be building, and it doesn't look like there is any way it is going to ease up in the near future,\" Mr Magnus says.",
      "What should worry the Communist Party is the commentary from the general public blaming those in power for this.",
      "Take this remark for example: \"If the government truly acts fairly and justly, there would not be so much anger and grievance in Chinese society\u2026 the government's efforts have focused on creating a superficial sense of harmony. While it may appear that they care about disadvantaged people, their actions have instead caused the greatest injustices.\"",
      "While violent attacks have been rising in many countries, according to Professor Ong, the difference in China is that officials have had little experience dealing with them.",
      "\"I think the authorities are very alarmed because they've not seen it before, and their instinct is to crack down.\"",
      "When China's leader Xi Jinping spoke about the Zhuhai attack, he seemed to acknowledge pressure was building in society. He urged officials across the country to \"learn hard lessons from the incident, address risks at their roots, resolve conflicts and disputes early and take proactive measures to prevent extreme crime\".",
      "But, so far, the lessons learnt seem to have led to a push for quicker police response times using greater surveillance, rather than considering any changes to the way China is run.",
      "\"China is moving into a new phase, a new phase that we have not seen since the late 70s,\" Prof Ong says, referring to the time when the country began opening to the world again, unleashing enormous change.",
      "\"We need to brace for unexpected events, such as a lot of random attacks and pockets of protest and social instability emerging.\"",
      "When horror hits China, the first instinct is shut it down",
      "Burnt out or jobless - meet China's 'full-time children'",

    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to delay an upcoming TikTok ban while he works on a \"political resolution\".",
      "His lawyer filed a legal brief on Friday with the court that says Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office\".",
      "On 10 January, the court is due to hear arguments on a US law that requires TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social media company to an American firm or face a ban come 19 January - a day before Trump takes office.",
      "US officials and lawmakers had accused ByteDance of being linked to the Chinese government - which the firm denies.",
      "Those allegations of an app that has 170 million users in the US led Congress to pass a bill in April, which President Joe Biden signed into law, that included the divest or ban requirement.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance have filed multiple legal challenges against the law, arguing that it threatens American free speech protections, with little success. With no potential buyer materialising so far, the companies' final chance to derail the ban has been via the American high court.",
      "While the Supreme Court has previously declined to act on a request for an emergency injunction against the law, it agreed to allow TikTok, ByteDance and the US government to plead their cases on 10 January - just days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Trump had met with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last week.",
      "In his court filing on Friday, Trump said the case represents \"an unprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national security concerns on the other\".",
      "While the filing said that Trump \"takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute\", it added that pushing back the 19 January deadline would grant Trump \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution\" to the matter without having to resort to the court.",
      "The US justice department has argued that alleged Chinese links to TikTok present a national security threat - and multiple state governments have raised concerns about the popular social media app.",

      "It was thought that all these invasive predators had eaten the tiny snails to extinction. Then a series of conservation expeditions - between 2012 and 2017 - proved otherwise.",
      "Conservationists discovered just 200 surviving individuals on the island.",
      "Those snails were believed to be the last of their kind, so they were collected and  brought into captivity.",
      "At Chester Zoo, the conservation science team made a new home for 60 of the precious snails. The right food, vegetation and conditions were recreated in miniature habitat tanks.",
      "1,329 snail offspring, bred at the zoo, have now been marked with identification dots - using non-toxic pens and nail varnish - and transported back to the wild for release.",

      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

    "summary": "Salome Zourabichvili's term is due to end on Sunday, but she says she is her country's last legitimate institution.",
    "story": [
      "Salome Zourabichvili's family fled Georgia in 1921 after Soviet forces snuffed out the country's three-year experiment with independence from Russia.",
      "A century later, Georgia's pro-Western president is refusing to leave office, arguing she is the last legitimate institution in her country,",
      "On Sunday, her six-year term as president is due to end. According to a new system for selecting the head of state, on that day she will be replaced by former Manchester City footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili, chosen with the support of the governing Georgian Dream party.",
      "Zourabichvili, 72, has denounced his election under an electoral college system in which he was the only candidate as a travesty.",
      "When she became president in 2018 she was endorsed by Georgian Dream, but she has since condemned their contested election victory in late October as a \"Russian special operation\" and backed nightly pro-EU protests outside parliament.",
      "The government says if she refuses to leave office she will be committing a crime.",
      "If she is forced out, she says the ruling party's takeover of the state will be complete and Georgia will have surrendered its sovereignty to a party that she accuses of serving Moscow.",
      "'A mythical place'",
      "Salome Zourabichvili was born in France in 1952 into a prominent family of Georgian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Her grandfather, a minister in the government of briefly independent Georgia, fled to France in 1921.",
      "Georgia, then under Soviet rule, loomed large in her childhood. It was a \"mythical place, which only existed in books,\" she said in a 2004 interview.",
      "Though raised in a culturally Georgian environment, speaking the language at home and attending Georgian Orthodox church services, she easily integrated into French culture. She attended France's elite schools, including Sciences Po, traditionally a feeder for the country's top public servants.",
      "She excelled, serving as a French diplomat for nearly 30 years. But throughout, her true passion remained in extricating her parents' mysterious country of origin from Russia's influence and bringing it closer to the West.",
      "\"She sees it as her life's mission to bring Georgia into Europe. Everything else for her has always been secondary,\" said Alexandre Crevaux-Asatiani, a former Zourabichvili aide.",
      "In 2003, she was appointed French ambassador to Georgia. A year later, she was granted Georgian citizenship and made foreign minister under President Mikheil Saakashvili. Dismissed in 2005, she took an increasingly prominent role in her adopted country's politics, founding a new party.",
      "Saakashvili's rule ended in 2012 and Georgian Dream have been in power ever since. The party's founder, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, is widely seen by Georgians as the most powerful man in their country. By a quirk of fate, he is also French, having taken citizenship in 2010.",
      "Backed for the presidency by Ivanishvili's party, Zourabichvili was initially unpopular among the country's pro-Western youth. A popular TV show mocked her halting Georgian, spoken with a strong French accent.",
      "She was seen as aligned with the ruling party, unpopular with many young people, and she blamed a short war with Russia in 2008 on Georgia allowing itself to be provoked.",
      "But as her presidential term progressed, Georgian Dream took an increasingly authoritarian and anti-Western turn, cracking down on civil society and NGOs. It refused to join Western sanctions on Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and called the West the \"global war party\", making a mockery of its stated aim of joining the EU and Nato.",
      "Zourabichvili openly defied the government, believing she had the support of the majority of Georgia's population.",
      "She pledged to veto a bill on \"foreign influence\" that mirrored Russian legislation passed under President Vladimir Putin, but the government passed it anyway, defying weeks of protests.",
      "\"The choice for Georgia is between independence or slavery, Europe or Russia,\" she said in April.",
      "She has often addressed the protesters who have turned out every night for a month outside parliament, casting them as the conscience of the nation against a Russia-friendly government.",
      "Last month she asked riot police, accused by the opposition of brutalising protesters: \"Are you serving Russia or Georgia?\"",
      "Many protesters, initially distrustful of the president for coming to power with Georgian Dream's backing, came to respect her outspoken opposition.",
      "\"No-one expected her to be this good. She reflects our values,\" said Irakli, a 34-year-old who has been regularly demonstrating. \"She motivates us to fight.\"",
      "Ahead of October's contested elections, the government tried to impeach her for meeting EU leaders without government authorisation. Ultimately the effort failed but it was an indication of the showdown to come.",
      "Zourabichvili called the elections, which returned Georgian Dream to power, \"totally falsified\". She backed opposition parties' calls for a re-run, drawing the ire of senior party leaders.",
      "'Let's see where she ends up'",
      "She now faces perhaps her biggest challenge so far, as Georgian Dream prepares to install her replacement, Mikheil Kavelashvili, as president.",
      "But Zourabichvili has insisted she will not go, setting up a likely constitutional crisis. Georgian Dream Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has threatened her with arrest.",
      "\"Let's see where she ends up, behind bars or outside,\" he told reporters this week.",
      "The government is likely to force her to leave one way or another, said Petre Tsiskarishvili of the opposition United National Movement.",
      "Conscious of not wanting to make her a political martyr and elevate her profile further, it may avoid a high-profile arrest, he added, perhaps merely locking her out of her official residence at the Orbeliani Palace.",
      "Doubts towards her will persist. Some in the opposition blame her for providing a pro-European face to Georgian Dream's authoritarian turn for far too long, refraining from criticising Ivanishvili until only a few months ago.",
      "But in a country where pro-European forces have often been fractured, Zourabichvili's supporters say she is likely to emerge from her term in office as a key opponent to the government.",
      "\"Even if she is arrested, she will still be considered the legitimate president of Georgia. There is no question about it,\" said Mr Crevaux-Asatiani, the president's former aide.",

      "Vivek Ramaswamy, tapped by Trump to slash government spending, claimed American culture is to blame for US firms deciding to hire skilled foreign workers, which is typically done via the H-1B temporary worker visas.",
      "\"Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" Ramaswamy wrote in a long X post that argued that foreign workers improve the US economy.",

      "\"If we are going to have a throwdown, let's have it now,\" prominent Trump supporter Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Friday. He went on to call the Republican claims of support of the H-1B programme a \"total scam\".",

      "Han will be suspended from his duties as soon as he is officially notified by parliament.",
      "The opposition first filed an impeachment motion against Han on Thursday after he blocked the appointment of three judges that parliament had chosen to oversee Yoon's case.",
      "Korea's Constitutional Court is typically made up of a nine-member bench. At least six judges must uphold Yoon's impeachment in order for the decision to be upheld.",
      "There are currently only six judges on the bench, meaning a single rejection would save Yoon from being removed.",

      "On Friday, the Korean won plunged to its lowest level against the dollar since the global financial crisis 16 years ago - with both parties blaming each other for the chaos.",

    "summary": "The White House has said the flight may have been hit by missiles fired by a Russian air-defence system.",
    "story": [
      "On 25 December, 38 people died when an Azerbaijan Airlines flight, which had been due to land in Russia, crash-landed in Kazakhstan.",
      "The circumstances around the crash remain unclear, but limited evidence so far suggests it may have been damaged by missiles fired by a Russian air-defence system as it tried to land in Chechnya.",
      "Here's what we know about Flight J2-8243.",
      "Flight takes off",
      "In the early morning on Christmas Day, Flight J2-8243 took off from the airport of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. It was due to land in Grozny, the capital of the Russian region of Chechnya.",
      "On board were 67 passengers, most of whom were Azerbaijani nationals, as well as those from Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "The plane was an Embraer 190, operated by Azerbaijan Airlines.",
      "Approach to Grozny",
      "As the flight approached Grozny, it entered thick fog, surviving passengers say.",
      "They describe the pilot attempting to land the plane twice during these conditions.",
      "It was on the third attempt, survivors say, that they felt a series of explosions hit the plane.",
      "\"The third time, something exploded... some of the aircraft's skin had blown out,\" one told Russian TV.",
      "A flight attendant on the plane, Zulfuqar Asadov, told local media the impact of the strike \"caused panic inside\".",
      "\"We tried to calm [the passengers] down, to get them seated. At that moment, there was another strike, and my arm was injured,\" he said.",
      "A video filmed in flight by a passenger showed oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling.",
      "Azerbaijan's transport minister Rashad Nabiyev said: \"All [the survivors] without exception stated they heard three blast sounds when the aircraft was above Grozny.\"",
      "He said the plane was subjected to \"external interference\" and damaged inside and out as it tried to land.",
      "In recent weeks, Ukraine has been targeting Chechnya and other parts of the Russian Caucasus with drone strikes.",
      "After the crash, authorities in Moscow said such attacks had triggered a protocol to close the airspace above Grozny.",
      "According to local officials, a drone was shot down by air defence above a shopping mall in Vladikavkaz, in nearby North Ossetia, that morning.",
      "It is unclear whether the closed-airspace protocol - known as a \"carpet plan\" - was enacted before or while Flight J2-8243 was in Russian air space.",
      "Diversion to Kazakhstan",
      "After the incident over Grozny, the plane diverted some 450km (280 miles) east to Aktau airport in Kazakhstan.",
      "It remains unclear why it was diverted over the Caspian Sea - a far longer journey than several other options.",
      "Russian aviation authorities have claimed the pilots of the plane were \"offered other airports\", but chose Aktau.",
      "Data released by the flight-tracking website Flight Radar shows the plane zig-zagging up and down as it approached Aktau, before turning and crash-landing just kilometres from the airport.",
      "Crash-landing",
      "Video from near the scene shows the plane descending rapidly through the air before crashing into the ground and skidding for several hundred metres in a ball of flame.",
      "38 people were killed and 29 survived, some with serious injuries. Remarkably, some survivors were seen walking and crawling from the plane's wreckage.",
      "The pilots of the plane are credited with saving lives by managing to land part of the plane, despite themselves being killed in the crash.",
      "It is believed most of those who survived were seated in its rear.",
      "Was it hit by Russian air defence?",
      "Initial reports from Russian media suggested the aircraft collided with a flock of birds.",
      "However, aviation experts and others in Azerbaijan believe the plane's GPS was affected by electronic jamming and it was then damaged by shrapnel from Russian air-defence missile blasts.",
      "On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin apologised to his Azerbaijani counterpart over the downing of the plane, but did not say whether Russia was responsible.",
      "He said the \"tragic incident\" happened when Russian air defence systems were actively repelling Ukrainian drones. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Russia \"must provide clear explanations and stop spreading disinformation\".",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had earlier refused to comment on reports the plane was hit by Russian weaponry and said an investigation was underway.",
      "On Friday White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the US had \"early indications\" Russia was responsible, but declined to comment further.",
      "So far, Azerbaijan's government has avoided directly accusing Russia - but Azerbaijani government sources told Reuters news agency that the investigation has already identified the weapon that fired on the flight as the Russian Pantsir-S anti-aircraft system.",
      "The investigation",
      "The plane's flight recorders, which contain data to help determine the cause of a crash, have been found.",
      "Reports in Baku suggest both Russia and Kazakhstan have proposed having a committee from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - a regional organisation dominated by Russia - investigate the crash, but Azerbaijan has instead demanded an international inquiry.",

    "story": [
      "It was early December when Douna Haj Ahmed, a Syrian refugee, discovered the disturbing details of her husband's detention in the notorious Al-Khatib prison \u2013 known as \"Hell on Earth\".",
      "She was watching bewildered prisoners fleeing the country's brutal security apparatus, on the news at home in London, after rebel forces had ousted Bashar al-Assad as president.",
      "Through tears, Abdullah Al Nofal, her husband of eight years sat next to her, turned and said: \"This is where I was arrested, this is the place.\"",
      "Douna, whose brothers were also arrested during Syria's 13-year civil war, says she had an idea of what her husband experienced during his detention - but this was the first time he was sharing the full details of what he endured.",
      "\"Abdullah does not like to share things emotionally, he likes to look like a strong guy all the time,\" Douna, 33, tells the BBC.",
      "\"It was a turning point. I saw him weak. I saw him crying. I saw him saying: 'This is where I was. I could be one of them. I could be one of them right now, or I could be dead'.",
      "\"I feel that when he saw this, he felt that this [was] closure,\" she adds. \"Now we want people to hear what Syrians went through.\"",
      "Abdullah, 36, was working in Damascus as a store keeper with the International Committee of the Red Cross in July 2013 when he and his colleagues were stopped at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the Syrian capital.",
      "He says he participated in anti-regime protests in 2011 in the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, but soon distanced himself when rebels began to use violence and weapons in response to a brutal crackdown by the regime's forces.",
      "Abdullah was singled out at the checkpoint and put on a green bus, handcuffed and blindfolded, and taken to a military area. He says he was then put in solitary confinement for three days and beaten.",
      "\"It was so dark for three days, I remember,\" he says.",
      "\"I don't [hear] any sound. It was so dark. You hear nothing. You feel so lonely.\"",
      "Abdullah was then transported to Al-Khatib, a detention centre in Damascus, and taken to a cell with about 130 people.",
      "Al-Khatib was one of several detention facilities operated by Syrian intelligence services.",
      "Almost 60,000 people were tortured and killed in the prisons run by the Assad regime during the civil war, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.",
      "Two years ago, a historic trial in Germany found a Syrian colonel who worked in Al-Khatib guilty of crimes against humanity. Anwar Raslan, 58, was linked to the torture of over 4,000 people in the prison.",
      "In court, witnesses described how detainees were raped and hung from the ceiling for hours, as well as the use of electric shocks before being doused in water. Assad's authoritarian government previously denied accusations of torturing.",
      "'Every minute it's like you're dying'",
      "During his detention in 2013,  Abdullah describes how he would regularly hear the screams of people being tortured.",
      "He recalls how diseases were rife and that about 20 people died while he was detained there.",
      "\"When I started to look around everywhere, there were people standing almost naked,\" he tells the BBC. \"They were full of blood, like they [have] been tortured.",
      "\"If you are not tortured yourself, every minute they will take someone to the investigation.",
      "\"They will get back to the room full of blood... every time you touch someone they will scream because you touched their wound.\"",
      "After 12 days, Abdullah was taken to be interrogated, where he says he was repeatedly beaten with a metal weapon and accused of transporting weapons.",
      "He explains how he could not deny the accusations put forward to him as it would lead to prolonged punishment.",
      "\"As long as you say, 'I didn't do it', they will keep torturing you and they will take you to another stage in torturing,\" he says.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A man of few words, Manmohan Singh led the country from the front - but was deeply misunderstood along the way.",
    "story": [
      "The prospect of a shy politician is somewhat hard to imagine. Unless that politician is Manmohan Singh.",
      "Since the death of the former Indian prime minister on Thursday, much has been said about the \"kind and soft-spoken politician\" who changed the course of Indian history and impacted the lives of millions.",
      "His state funeral is being held on Saturday and India's government has announced an official mourning period of seven days.",
      "Despite an illustrious career - he was governor of India's central bank and federal finance minister before becoming a two-term prime minister - Singh never came across as a big-stage politician, lacking the public swagger of many of his peers.",
      "Though he gave interviews and held news conferences, especially in his first term as prime minister, he chose to stay quiet even when his government was mired in scandals or when his cabinet ministers faced corruption allegations.",
      "His gentlemanly ways were both deplored and adored in equal measure.",
      "His admirers said he was careful not to pick unnecessary battles or make lofty promises and that he focused on results - perhaps best exemplified by the pro-market reforms he ushered in as finance minister which opened India's economy to the world.",
      "\"I don't think anyone in India believes that Manmohan Singh can do something wrong or corrupt,\" his  former colleague in the Congress party, Kapil Sibal, once said,. \"He was extremely cautious, and he always wanted to be on the right side of the law.\"",
      "His opponents, on the other hand, mocked him, saying he exhibited a kind of fuzziness unsuitable for a politician, let alone the premier of a country of more than one billion people. His voice - husky and breathless, almost like a tired whisper - often became the butt of jokes.",
      "But the same voice was also endearing to many who found him relatable in a world of politics where high-pitched and high-octane speeches were the norm.",
      "Singh's image as a media-shy, unassuming, introverted politician never left him, even when his contemporaries, including his own party members, went through dramatic cycles of reinvention.",
      "Yet, it was the dignity with which he manoeuvred each situation - even the difficult ones - that made him so memorable.",
      "Born to a poor family in what is now Pakistan, Singh was India's first Sikh prime minister. His personal story - of a Cambridge and Oxford-educated economist who overcame insurmountable odds to rise up the ranks - coupled with his image of an honest and thoughtful leader, had already made him a hero to India's middle classes.",
      "But in 2005, he surprised everyone when he made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which around 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "The riots, in which several Congress party members were accused, broke out after the assassination of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. One of them later said they shot the Congress politician to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar.",
      "It was a bold move - no other prime minister, including from the Congress party, had gone so far as to offer an apology. But it provided a healing touch to the Sikh community and politicians across party lines respected him for the courageous act.",
      "A few years later, in 2008, Singh's understated style of leadership received more praise after he signed a landmark deal with the US that ended India's decades-long nuclear isolation, allowing India access to nuclear technology and fuel for the first time since it held tests in 1974.",
      "The deal was massively criticised by opposition leaders and Singh's own allies, who feared it would compromise India's foreign policy. Singh, however, managed to salvage both his government and the deal.",
      "The period 2008-2009 also witnessed global financial turmoil but Singh's policies were credited for shielding India from it.",
      "In 2009, he led his party to a resounding victory and returned as the PM for a second term, cementing his image of a benevolent leader, or rather, the exciting idea that leaders could be benevolent.",
      "For many, he had become virtue personified, the \"reluctant prime minister\" who stayed clear of the spotlight and refused to make any dramatic gestures, but was also not afraid of taking bold decisions for the sake of his country's future.",
      "Then, things began to unravel.",
      "A string of corruption allegations - first around the hosting of the Commonwealth Games, then the illegal allocation of coal fields - plagued the Congress party and Singh's government. Some of these corruption allegations were later found to be untrue or exaggerated. Some cases from the period are still pending in courts.",
      "But Singh had already begun to feel some pressure. During his tenure, he made several attempts at reconciliation with India's arch rival neighbour Pakistan, hoping for a thaw in the decades-old frosty relations.",
      "The approach was sharply questioned in 2008 when a terror attack led by a Pakistan-based terror group killed 171 people in Mumbai city.",
      "The 60-hour siege, one of the bloodiest in the country's history, opened a chasm of allegations, as the opposition blamed the government's \"soft stance\" on terrorism for the tragedy.",
      "In the coming years, other decisions Singh made badly backfired.",
      "In 2011, an anti-corruption movement led by social activist Anna Hazare shook up Singh's government. The frail 72-year-old became an icon for the middle classes, as he demanded stringent anti-corruption laws in the country.",
      "As a middle-class hero himself, Singh was expected to deal with Hazare's demands more perceptively. Instead, the prime minister tried to quash the movement, allowing the police to arrest Hazare and disband his demonstration.",
      "The move stoked a wave of public and media hostility against him. Those who once admired his understated style wondered if they had misjudged the politician and began to see his quiet ways through a less generous lens.",
      "The feeling was heightened the next year when Singh refused to comment on the horrific gang rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi for more than a week.",
      "To make things worse, India's economic growth was slowing. Corruption grew and jobs shrank, sparking waves of public anger. And Singh's unassuming personality, which once made his every move seem like a revelation, was labelled as showing complacency, diffidence and even arrogance by some.",
      "Yet, Singh never tried to defend or explain himself and faced the criticism quietly.",
      "That was until 2014. At a rare news conference, he announced that he would not seek a third term in office.",
      "But he also tried to set the record straight. \"I honestly believe that history will judge me more kindly than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament did, \" he said, after listing some of the biggest accomplishments of his tenure.",
      "He was right.",
      "As it turned out, neither the Congress, nor Singh, could entirely recover from the damage as they lost the general elections to the BJP. But despite the many hurdles, Singh's image as a kind and discerning leader stayed with him.",
      "Throughout his prime ministerial stint and despite a second term plagued by controversies, he maintained an aura of personal dignity and integrity.",
      "His policies were seen to centre around the middle class and the poor - he approved manifold increase in salaries of central employees, kept inflation in check and introduced landmark schemes on educations and jobs.",
      "It may not have been enough to elevate him from the quandaries of politics or shield him from some of the failures of his career.",
      "But there was more to his shyness; he was a leader of steely resolve."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 02:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Carmen Souza's latest album is inspired by the little-known British influence on the Cape Verde islands.",
    "story": [
      "When she was a young child and taking too long to get ready for school, family get-togethers or to sing in the church choir, Cape Verdean musician Carmen Souza was often told to \"ariope\".",
      "What she did not realise until years later was that the Creole word came directly from the English word \"hurry up\".",
      "\"We have so many words that derive from the British English,\" Souza, a jazz singer-songwriter and instrumentalist, tells the BBC.",
      "\"'Salong' is 'so long', 'fulespide' is 'full speed', 'streioei' is 'straightaway', 'bot' is 'boat', and 'ariope' - which I always remember my father saying to me when he wanted me to pick up my pace.\"",
      "Ariope is now one of eight songs that Souza has composed for the album Port'Ingl\u00eas - meaning English port - to explore the little-known history of the 120-year-old British presence in Cape Verde. It started off as research for her master's degree.",
      "\"Cape Verdeans are very connected to music - in fact, we always say that music is our biggest export - and so I wondered whether there was also a musical impact,\" she says.",
      "There are very few recordings of compositions of the time - Souza did discover that an American ethnomusicologist, Helen Heffron Roberts, recorded some in the 1930s but they are on very fragile wax cylinders and can only be listened to in person at Yale University in the US.",
      "So rather than rearranging old recordings, Souza - and her musical partner Theo Pas'cal - created new music, inspired by stories she came across.",
      "She has combined jazz and English sea shanties with Cape Verdean rhythms - including the funan\u00e1, played on an iron rod with a knife and the accordion, and the batuque, played by women and based on African drumming rhythms.",
      "The Cape Verdean islands lie about 500km (310 miles) off the coast of West Africa. They are mostly arid, with limited arable land and prone to drought.",
      "But they are a strategic midway point in the Atlantic Ocean, and they were first controlled by the Portuguese as they traded between south-east Asia, Europe and the Americas - in spices, silk and enslaved people. With the abolition of the slave trade, Cape Verde went into decline.",
      "Cape Verde remained a Portuguese colony until 1975 - but during the 18th and 19th Centuries, British merchants settled and Cape Verde once again became a bustling crossroads.",
      "The British came for the cheap labour, goats, donkeys, salt, turtles, amber and archil, a special ink that was used in British clothes manufacturing.",
      "They built roads, bridges and developed the natural ports - which became known as Port'Ingl\u00eas - and set up coaling stations, with coal brought in from Wales.",
      "S\u00e3o Vicente's Mindelo port became a vital refuelling stop for steamships carrying goods across the Atlantic Ocean or to Africa - and an important global communications hub with the 1875 arrival of a submarine cable station.",
      "Souza's exploration of the British presence in Cape Verde quickly became personal.",
      "\"As I started to research, I found so many personal connections,\" Souza says - including the fact that her grandfather loaded coal on to ships in Mindelo.",
      "That inspired her to write Ariope - the story of an older man urging a younger man, who prefers to stay in the shade playing his guitar, to \"ariope\". The British ships are coming and the sailors do not like to wait - \"fulespide, streioei\", the song goes.",
      "Souza imagines the spirit of her grandfather in the song. He used to play the fiddle - and was known as a great storyteller.",
      "\"I was told that if you had to walk with him for kilometres, you wouldn't notice the distance because it would be one funny story after another.\"",
      "Souza is part of Cape Verde's large diaspora. She was born in Portugal, and now lives in London. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are about 700,000 Cape Verdeans living abroad - twice as many as at home.",
      "Historically, people were forced to move for work because of famine, drought, poverty and lack of opportunities.",
      "This movement contributed to the islands' deep, rich tradition of strongly distinctive music, including the melancholic morna made famous by singer Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora and declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco in 2019.",
      "The composer behind many of the songs that made \u00c9vora a global star was Francisco Beleza - also known as B L\u00e9za. He revolutionised morna and was one of Cape Verde's most influential writers, composers and morna singers.",
      "According to Souza's research, he also considered the British presence to be more beneficial than the Portuguese - at least to middle-class Cape Verdeans.",
      "Souza's track Amizadi, a mix of funan\u00e1 and jazz, was inspired by B L\u00e9za's admiration of the British. He composed a morna - Hitler ca ta ganha guerra, ni nada, meaning \"Hitler will not win the war\" to show solidarity with the British people during World War II - and even raised money for the British war effort.",
      "Souza found that ports were \"an important hub for musicians\" who flocked there to learn the music - and instruments - of visiting foreign sailors.",
      "They blended them with Cape Verdean rhythms to create new sounds. The mazurka - derived from a Polish musical form - and contradan\u00e7a from the British quadrille dance.",
      "Early written records of Cape Verdean music are scarce - the Portuguese colonists did not document life and society on Cape Verde other than records of taxes and commodities.",
      "They also banned the batuque - for being too noisy and too African - and funan\u00e1 because its lyrics challenged social inequalities.",
      "But Souza found an intriguing entry in the diary of British naturalist Charles Darwin, who arrived in Cape Verde in 1832 - the first stop on his famous Beagle voyage to study the living world.",
      "He describes an encounter with a group of about 20 young women who, writes Darwin, \"sung with great energy a wild song, beating with their hands upon their legs\".",
      "That, says Souza, is most probably an early performance of batuque - and she was inspired to write the song Sant Jago by Darwin's accounts of the warm hospitality he received on Cape Verde.",
      "Many younger Cape Verdean musicians tend not to play the islands' older rhythms, and some like the contradan\u00e7a are slowly dying out.",
      "Souza hopes that her Port'Ingl\u00eas album will inspire younger generations that \"there is a way to do something new with the traditional genres\".",
      "\"I always bring some different elements - improvisation, the piano, the flute, the jazz harmonisation - so that the music is going through another process of creolisation.\"",

      "As an IDF reservist Noam would normally expect to do a few weeks of military service a year. But this past year he\u2019s spent 250 days in uniform. The war, he said, had ripped him away from the life he knew. His plans to become a doctor have also been set back by a year.",
      "When we meet Noam was trying to catch up with his studies, but also waiting to see whether he\u2019d be called up again. His mood was defiant.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t put my life on hold anymore,\u201d he said. Unless there was a dramatic change in the direction of the war, he said he wouldn\u2019t be returning to his unit. He\u2019d had enough.",
      "The IDF already acknowledges that fewer reserves are now reporting for duty. After the attacks by Hamas on 7 October last year, which killed about 1,200 people, more than 300,000 reservists responded. Turnout exceeded 100%. Now it\u2019s down to 85%. Noam estimates that in his unit the response is even lower \u2013 with around 60% of those called up now reporting for duty.",
      "Reserves and conscripts are the lifeblood of the IDF. Brigadier General Ariel Heimann \u2013 also a reservist and a former chief reserve officer - says Israel is too small a country to have a large, expensive, professional, regular army. Without reservists, he says, the IDF wouldn\u2019t be able to fight or survive.",
      "According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the IDF has 170,000 active duty personnel, including conscripts, and 465,000 reserves.",
      "Brig Gen Heimann admits the IDF\u2019s reliance on reserves will become more challenging the longer the war goes on. He likened the IDF to a spring \u2013 if it\u2019s stretched too far it\u2019ll break. At the moment he says it\u2019s coping.",
      "But in a sign of the strain the IDF wants to extend mandatory service for male conscripts from 32 to 36 months.",
      "The fact that the burden of service is not being shared by all, has also fuelled a sense of resentment. One group has been exempt from military service for decades \u2013 thousands of Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, Jews. They believe the lives of their young men should be dedicated to religious studies not military service.",
      "The issue has already divided Israel\u2019s coalition government. But, following the intervention of the attorney general, call up papers are being sent to 7,000 Haredi Jewish men. They\u2019ve responded with angry protests. But Brig Gen Heimann, like the ousted former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, says they have a \u201cmoral duty to serve\u201d.",
      "There\u2019s not just a personal sacrifice required, but an economic one too.",
      "The Bank of Israel said in May that the cost of the war for Israel could reach $70bn (\u00a355bn) by the end of next year, an estimate made before the country's ground invasion of Lebanon. Small businesses are among the hardest hit.",
      "Shelly Lotan\u2019s food tech start-up is among many fighting for survival. Shelly\u2019s already had to move her business from northern Israel to avoid Hezbollah\u2019s rockets. Two of her seven employees have been called up for military service.",
      "On the morning we meet, at her Tel Aviv home, Shelly has just received more bad news. She\u2019s received a text from one of her staff whose military service is being extended.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t express how critical it is to have another employee missing for another month,\u201d says Shelly.",

      "Shelly\u2019s also had to juggle family life with three young children. Her husband, also a reservist, has had to spend long periods away from home.",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon may ease some of the pressure. But there\u2019s still fighting in Gaza. Shelly Lotan fears for the future without a clear strategy from Israel\u2019s government to end the conflict.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 05:41:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Former Indian PM Manmohan Singh, who died on Thursday, led India through both good and bad times.",
    "story": [
      "People in India are reflecting on former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's contribution to the country since his death on Thursday evening.",
      "Singh, who held the top post for two consecutive terms between 2004 and 2014, was seen as an architect of India's economic liberalisation which changed the country's growth trajectory.",
      "The first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to return to power, Singh was also the first Sikh to assume the top office.",
      "Known as a soft-spoken technocrat, he had earlier headed India's central bank, served as a finance secretary and minister, and led the opposition in the upper house of parliament.",
      "Here are five milestones from Singh's life that shaped his career and had a lasting impact on more than a billion Indians.",
      "Economic liberalisation",
      "Singh was appointed finance minister in 1991 by the Congress party-led government under Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao.",
      "India's economy at the time was facing a serious financial crisis, with the country's foreign reserves at a dangerously low level, barely enough to pay for two weeks of imports.",
      "Singh led the initiative to deregulate the economy to avoid its collapse, which he argued was otherwise imminent. Despite stiff opposition from members of his government and party, Singh prevailed.",
      "He took bold measures that included devaluing the currency, reducing import tariffs and privatising state-owned companies.",
      "He was famously quoted as saying in parliament during his first budget speech in 1991 that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "Later, as prime minister, Singh continued to build on his economic reform measures, lifting millions of Indians out of poverty and contributing to India's rise as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.",
      "Reluctant prime minister",
      "The Congress party made a comeback in 2004 elections, handing a surprise defeat to the government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was widely expected to head the government, but many members of the outgoing ruling party raised questions over the fact that she was born in Italy. She declined to take up the post and instead proposed Singh's name, who was seen as a non-controversial, consensus candidate of great personal integrity.",
      "In the next parliamentary election, he helped his party win a bigger mandate, but critics often termed him a \"remote-controlled\" prime minister managed by the Gandhi family.",
      "Singh often refused to comment on such allegations and kept his focus on the job.",
      "He may have started his first stint as prime minister with some reluctance but he soon stamped his authority on the top job.",
      "Singh's tenure, particularly between 2004 and 2009, saw the country's GDP grow at a healthy average pace of around 8%, the second fastest among major economies.",
      "He took bold decisions on reforms and brought more foreign investment into the country. Experts credit him for shielding India from the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "But his second term, in an alliance with a disparate group of parties, was marked by allegations of corruption against some of his cabinet ministers, though his personal integrity was never questioned.",
      "In response to these allegations, he told journalists in 2014 in his last press conference as prime minister that he hoped history would judge him differently.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he said.",
      "\"I think taking into account the circumstances and the compulsions of a coalition polity, I have done as best as I could do under the circumstances.\"",
      "Rights to education, information and identity",
      "As prime minister, Singh took several far-reaching decisions that continue to impact the health of Indian democracy even today.",
      "He introduced new laws that strengthened and guaranteed the right to seek information from the government, allowing citizens an extraordinary power to hold officials accountable.",
      "He also introduced a rural employment scheme which guaranteed livelihood for a minimum of 100 days, a measure economists said had a profound impact on rural incomes and poverty reduction.",
      "He also brought in a law that guaranteed the right to free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6 and 14, significantly reducing the school dropout rates.",
      "His government also introduced a unique identity project called Aadhar to improve financial inclusion and delivery of welfare benefits to the poor. The current federal government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has continued to keep Aadhar as a cornerstone for many of its policies.",
      "Apology for anti-Sikh riots",
      "In 1984, prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar.",
      "Her death sparked massive violence that resulted in the death of more than 3,000 Sikhs and a widespread destruction of their property.",
      "Singh formally apologised to the nation in 2005 in parliament, saying the violence were \"the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our constitution\".",
      "\"I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. I apologise not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation,\" he said.",
      "No other prime minister, particularly from the Congress party, had gone this far to apologise in parliament for the riots.",
      "Deal with US",
      "Singh signed a historic deal with the US in 2008 to end India's nuclear isolation after its 1998 testing of the weapon system.",
      "His government argued that the deal wouldhelp meet India's growing energy needs and sustain its healthy growth rate.",
      "The deal, seen as a watershed moment in the India-US relations, promised to grant a waiver to India to commence civilian nuclear trade with the US and the rest of the world.",
      "But it faced massive opposition, with critics of the deal alleging that it would compromise India's sovereignty and independence in foreign policy. In protest, the Left Front withdrew support from the governing alliance.",
      "Singh, however, managed to save both his government and the deal."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

    "title": "The US gay clubs dance style from 1970s headlining an Indian show",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 23:41:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Waack Girls tells the story of six women who discover themselves as they learn the dance form waacking.",
    "story": [
      "A woman dances in the spotlight, the glittering tassels on her dress shivering and swaying in tandem with her moves.",
      "But it's her arms that catch the light; they wave, spin and whip through the air at breath-taking speed, almost like the blades of a fan.",
      "These are the opening visuals of a recently released web series on Amazon Prime Video called Waack Girls, a drama centred around six women who learn a new dance form to become their city's first all-female waacking crew.",
      "Not many know about the dance and so the women have to fight hard - against society and their families - to be taken seriously. But waacking ends up being the gift that keeps on giving.",
      "Directed by Sooni Taraporevala, the series has been released at a time when many Indian cities - big and small - are witnessing a renewed interest in waacking.",
      "\"I was fascinated by the dance style and the importance it gives to self-expression,\" says Taraporevala about why she made the series.",
      "Workshops and underground waacking jams - events where dancers battle it out with their moves - are mushrooming in several cities and international waacking legends are visiting the country to teach the dance.",
      "Recently, Archie Burnett, who was a club dancer in New York in the 1970s and 80s and is a respected figure in the waacking community, visited India for a jam.",
      "Dancers hope that the web series will give waacking more visibility in the country and show people that there's more to dance than classical forms, hip-hop and Bollywood.",
      "Waacking has a history steeped in the LGBTQ+ liberation movement and the freedom championed by disco music.",
      "The dance style emerged in the gay clubs of Los Angeles in the 1970s, when there was a lot of stigma surrounding homosexuality. Gay men used waacking to express themselves on the dance floor and push back against the hate and discrimination they experienced.",
      "Consequently, the dance style developed swift, sharp and forceful movements - much like how action heroes in comic books beat up their villains, accompanied by sound-effects like \"ka-pow\" and \"bam\".",
      "\"Waacking comes from the onomatopoeic word 'whack' and is reminiscent of [the effects] found in comic books,\" says Tejasvi Patil, a Mumbai-based dancer who has been waacking for more than a decade.",
      "The dance style also drew inspiration from the drama of Hollywood and its glamorous leading ladies. Dramatic poses, quick footwork and striking arm movements are characteristic of waacking but dancers have continued to add new moves to the repertoire of steps, as celebrating individuality and self-expression are at the heart of the form.",
      "And because of its core ethos, waacking continues to be a tool of empowerment and self-expression for India's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"In fact, many people explore their sexual identity through the dance style because it allows space for introspection and expression,\" says Ayushi Amrute, who has been waacking since 2012 and is a frequent host of Red Bull's Your House Is Waack - a waacking jam for dancers across the country.",
      "\"Another important factor is that the waacking community always strives to be a safe space, so that people feel comfortable expressing themselves,\" she adds.",
      "When Amrute was introduced to waacking by her dance teacher, the style was virtually unknown in India. Her teacher encouraged her to watch videos and reach out to dancers abroad to learn more about the style.",
      "\"We [the handful of Indian dancers who began waacking over a decade ago] learnt waacking the hard way; by doing our own research, learning about the history of the dance and connecting with dancers in countries where waacking was popular,\" says Amrute.",
      "Patil remembers learning waacking the same way. But things are remarkably different today. In the past five years or so, the dance style has picked up in popularity, with more youngsters flocking to classes to learn it.",
      "Patil, who teaches dance, says that she encourages her students to stay true to the ethos of the style - unabashed self-expression.",
      "When it comes to music, India is still finding its soundscape for the style, she adds. Songs by disco queen Donna Summer and American pop legend Diana Ross are still popular, as are tracks from the 1983 film Staying Alive.",
      "Bollywood had its own disco era too, with songs like Koi Yahan Nache Nache and Aap Jaisa Koi becoming chart-toppers in the 1980s, but they don't often find space in today's waacking jams.",
      "For Waack Girls, Taraporevala brought in indie artists to create an album of original soundtracks, which Patil says has created a brand new and promising soundscape for waackers in India.",
      "\"I think the time is right for people to embrace who they are fully,\" says Patil, \"and waacking is the perfect platform to showcase what you find.\""

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:47:23 GMT",
    "summary": "A biodiversity hotspot has become the stomping ground of poachers.",
    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",
      "\"It's obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense that's happening in the world,\" Mr Van Wyk says.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 02:27:49 GMT",
    "summary": "It used to be considered treason in France - but now, alcohol-free wine is here to stay.",
    "story": [
      "In the vineyards of Bordeaux, the unspeakable has become the drinkable. Wine without alcohol has arrived.",
      "The heresy of yesterday is now \u2013 thanks to science and economic crisis \u2013 the opportunity of today.",
      "Wine estates which would have torched their grapes rather than submit to such ignominy, are now openly contemplating the booze-free bottle.",
      "And developers are moving ahead fast, creating wines that are deliberately designed to get the best from the de-alcoholisation process.",
      "\"When we started a few years ago, what we were making was frankly rubbish,\" says Bordeaux oenologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brochet, who has helped create the Moderato range of no-alcohol wines.",
      "\"But we have made great progress. And today we are getting nearer and nearer to our goal. I think it is going to be a revolution in the wine world.\"",
      "Bordeaux has just seen the launch of its first ever cave \u2013 wine shop \u2013 dedicated solely to no-alcohol wines, reflecting a shift in perceptions which has taken many in the industry by surprise.",
      "\"We only opened four weeks ago, and already we are getting wine-growers from the area coming in and asking about the non-alcohol market,\" says Alexandre Kettaneh,  who owns Les Belles Grappes with his wife Anne.",
      "\"They don't know anything about how to do it, but they can see it is coming and want to be part of it.\"",
      "Several things have happened to make the moment opportune.",
      "First of all, the French wine world is in deep difficulty. Domestic consumption continues to fall and the Chinese market is not what it was. US President-elect Donald Trump is threatening new levies. Prized ancient vineyards across France are being grubbed up.",
      "Second, consumption habits are shifting, especially among the young. Supermarkets now give more space to beer than they do to wine. Most 20-somethings have never had the habit of wine \u2013 and they are also far more health-conscious than their elders.",
      "The non-alcohol lifestyle is spreading. Currently 10% of the French beer market is alcohol-free. In Spain it is 25%.",
      "And third \u2013 the technology has improved by leaps and bounds.",
      "In the past \u2013 and still today for cheaper brands \u2013 the method has simply been to boil away the alcohol and then add compensatory flavours. The result \u2013 especially for reds \u2013 is at best mediocre. Such drinks cannot even call themselves wine, but \"beverages based on de-alcoholised wine\".",
      "Now though, there are new methods of low-temperature vacuum distillation, and of \"capturing\" aromas for putting back into the de-alcoholised wine. The result is wines that can legally call themselves wines, and are beginning to hold their own among discerning consumers.",
      "\"With reds, you need to be prepared for an experience which will not be the same as a traditional wine with alcohol. We cannot pretend we can replicate, yet, the full mouth-feel,\" says Fabien Marchand-Cassagne of Moderato.",
      "\"But what you will get is a genuine wine moment. Bouquet, tannins, fruits, balance \u2013 it is all there to be enjoyed.\"",
      "At the Clos De Bouard estate near Saint-Emilion, fully a third of sales are now of the chateau's two \u2013 soon to be three \u2013 non-alcoholic brands. Owner Coralie de Bouard first glimpsed the possibilities when she was asked in 2019 to develop a non-alcoholic wine for the Qatari owners of PSG football club.",
      "\"My family wouldn't talk to me for a year, such was my 'treason'. And even today I get hate mail from wine-growers saying I am ruining the market,\" she says.",
      "\"But now my father congratulates me and says I am the locomotive in the wine train. And if we are surviving today in these difficult times, it is because we have shifted towards the no-alcohol market.\"",
      "\"For the purists it's been very difficult to accept,\" says Bernard Rabouy, a wine-grower for the Bordeaux Families cooperative.",
      "\"But we have to evolve. The fact is that the customers aren't where they used to be. So we have to go and get them or they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "Promoters of alcohol-free wine make much of the notion that it allows non-drinkers \u2013 who used to feel excluded \u2013 to join in the wine-banter. And it is true that the rituals of opening, sniffing, describing and comparing are now open to all.",
      "\"What we want to do is try to bring back the France of our youth \u2013 when everyone sat around the dinner table and drank wine, and it was a real moment of sharing,\" says Anne Kattaneh.",
      "\"And these days the only way we are going to be able to do that is if non-alcoholic wines are part of the culture.\"",
      "\"The idea that the wine world was always as it is now, is rubbish,\" says oenologist Brochet.",
      "\"Things evolve. Once upon a time the barrel was an innovation. The cork was an innovation; grape varietals were an innovation. And now this is a new one \u2013 which could help save the industry and the wonderful landscape and culture that goes with it.",
      "\"As [poet] Paul Valery said \u2013 what is tradition, but an innovation that succeeded?\""

      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",

      "Meek was pronounced dead Dec. 21 at University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, the Jefferson County Coroner confirmed to CBS News. He succumbed to blunt force injuries he'd suffered two days earlier, when he fell from a moving vehicle, according to the coroner's report.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 16:54:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The appeal had asked the court to reinstate charges, including involuntary manslaughter, against Alec Baldwin.",
    "story": [
      "New Mexico prosecutors have dropped their appeal, ending an effort to\u00a0reinstate charges against Alec Baldwin in connection with the fatal shooting on the set of his movie \"Rust.\"",
      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",
      "David Halls, the film's safety coordinator, pleaded no contest last year to negligent use of a firearm. He completed six months of unsupervised parole."

      "The complaint, which was obtained by CBS News, names Baldoni, the studio behind \"It Ends With Us\" and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the complaint, which was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",

      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",

Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",

      "As the holiday season lights up New York City, few traditions shine brighter than the iconic holiday windows at Bergdorf Goodman. The luxury department store's displays are more than just decorations \u2014 they are works of art.",
      "And the mastermind behind the art is David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman. He has been with the store for more than 20 years and oversees the design of the windows each year.",
      "He noted that there's no school for making window displays, and that it seems no one in the field sets out to do the job \"on purpose.\"",
      "\"We just kind of happened into it,\" he said. \"And we wouldn't wanna do anything else because we're doing a little of everything. We're doing a little theater, a little storytelling, a little advertising, a little fashion.\"",
      "This year's theme is \"Toast of the Town,\" a nod to the 200th anniversary of Fifth Avenue's retail strip. The store's five large windows feature references to iconic elements of the avenue, such as parks, libraries and flagship stores. Hoey's team used a variety of materials, including actual taxi parts, to create scenes that celebrate New York.",
      "Planning for the displays starts in February, and craftsmen work in warehouses for months creating the detailed pieces. The finished windows are installed in just two weeks before being revealed to the public.",
      "One of this year's standout pieces is a rhinestone-covered praying mantis, made up of 100,000 rhinestones, along with a typewriter display.",
      "Hoey's attention to detail is evident as he directs his team to ensure every piece is perfectly positioned.",
      "\"It is creating almost holiday delirium for the customers,\" said Darcy Penick, president of Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "The windows will be on display at Bergdorf Goodman until Jan. 6, continuing a tradition that has delighted shoppers and passersby for decades.",
      "\"There is a question of .. every year, did we achieve what we set out to achieve?\" he said. \"I would say this year, we did.\""

    "title": "Werner Herzog keeps working, predicts: \"You'll have to carry me out from a set feet first\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thirty-seven-year-old Darren Criss is a star on Broadway, and a regular at piano bars. \"Keep the music going, you know?\" he said. \"I think the expression goes, 'Life is a cabaret!'\"",

      "One rule in a piano bar? Play the hits.  Criss had his first hit at the University of Michigan. He starred as Harry Potter in an unauthorized student show based on the books that became a YouTube sensation in 2009.",
      "\"This was a very interesting moment in time,\" he said, of \"A Very Potter Musical.\" \"That really did kind of change my life. That would kind of set me on the path to where I am now.\"",
      "From 2009: The unofficial parody show \"A Very Potter Musical\":",
      "I asked if \"A Very Potter Musical\" was the first musical to go viral. \"I don't know; I guess we'll let the YouTube historians sort of decide the validity of that,\" Criss said.",
      "But Criss took a detour on his way to Broadway, by becoming a TV star. \"'Glee' was happening at the time,\" he said. \"And I went out for it, like hundreds of thousands of other people in my situation at that time. And I happened to book it.\"",
      "He played Blaine Anderson, and quickly became a fan favorite. \"I owe my tenure on that show to the sub-cultural fan base army that we had gathered from the Potter stuff,\" he said.",

      "Criss said, \"This show begins with a song which is the question the show posits: Why love? Why do we do it? If we know that loving something enters you in a contract that has an inexorable back end \u2013 which is the loss of something \u2013 why do we do that, if we know that that's gonna happen?\"",
      "According to Criss, this show came along at the perfect time. He and his wife, Mia, have a two-and-a-half year-old daughter, and earlier this year they welcomed a baby son.",
      "I asked, \"Does this feel like the best year of your life?\"",
      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",
      "He's had some hard years, too. In 2020, his father, Bill, died at 78 from a heart condition. In 2022, his brother, Chuck, died at 36 by suicide.",
      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",
      "When he thinks about that, Darren Criss can't help but sing.",

    "summary": "The iconic singer-songwriter has long been a silver screen presence \u2013 as an actor, a subject of documentaries, and the figure in biopics. But Bob Dylan's love of movies has been a recurring theme in his art and his persona.",
    "story": [
      "A new Bob Dylan biopic, \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, arrives in theaters Christmas Day. As historian Douglas Brinkley tells us, it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy love affair between Dylan and the movies.",
      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",
      "-- \"I Shall Be Free\" by Bob Dylan",
      "Young Bob sported a leather jacket after seeing Marlon Brando in \"The Wild One.\" When he saw the juvenile melodrama \"Blackboard Jungle,\" with its innovative rock 'n' roll soundtrack, he reportedly said to a friend, \"This is exactly what we've been trying to tell people about ourselves.\"",
      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",
      "Once Dylan made it to New York's Greenwich Village, it was the art-house international films that caught his eye: Truffaut's \"Shoot the Piano Player\" \u2026 Fellini's \"La dolce vita.\" That film, about a tabloid journalist searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic Rome, looked, Dylan later said, \"like life in a carnival mirror.\"",
      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",
      "His music has enhanced scores of movie scores, from \"The Big Lebowski,\" to more recently \"St. Vincent.\"",
      "One film stuck with Dylan for decades: \"The Gunfighter,\" starring Gregory Peck. When Peck heard his name in Dylan's epic 1986 ballad \"Brownsville Girl,\" he phoned him up to thank him. Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997, when he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "The new biopic \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring an astounding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is hardly the first cinematic depiction of Dylan.

    "title": "The story of Handel's \"Messiah\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

      "The state hardest hit in the outbreak appeared to be Montana, where 17 were reported sickened, followed by Wisconsin, with 12 cases, and Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming each reporting eight cases. Massachusetts, Texas and Washington accounted for six cases, followed by five in South Dakota and three each in California, Illinois and Iowa. Alaska, Michigan, New Jersey and Utah all called in two cases, and eight states reported one: Arizona, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "But Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign.",
      "He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 20:27:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal officials say homelessness rose 18% in 2024, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing.",
    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon that her agency will need to start taking \"extraordinary measures\" or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",

The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Democrats uniformly voted for the measure, while Republicans in the Senate were split, with 20 voting to pass it and 20 voting against it. Four senators did not vote, including California's Adam Schiff, a Democrat; Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia; and two Republicans \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance of Ohio.",
      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill. Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Administration is awaiting the possible final enactment of the Social Security Fairness Act into law and rules for implementation. We will provide more information on our website,\u00a0ssa.gov\u00a0as it becomes available,\" a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",

      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution.

Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",

    "title": "CTA may require business owners to register with FinCEN before Jan. 13",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:56:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's beneficial ownership information rule, or BOI?",
      "The reporting rule is the CTA's Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirement, or BOI, which mandates small businesses to register the following with FinCEN, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

      "Here are other filing deadlines, depending on the date of a business' creation.",
      "Companies created on or after September 4, 2024 that had a filing deadline between December 3, 2024 and December 23, 2024 now have until January 13, 2025 to file with FinCEN.Businesses created or registered in the U.S. on or after Dec. 3, 2024 and on or before Dec. 23, 2024 have an extra 21 days from their original deadline to file with FinCEN.Those businesses that qualify for disaster relief may be have deadlines later than Jan. 13.

      "What happens if I don't register under the CTA?",
      "The penalties are up to $591 per day for failure to file, according to FinCEN.",
      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",
      "There are 23 types of businesses that are exempt from the beneficial ownership information filing, according to the Chamber of Commerce. These include many publicly traded companies and nonprofits, as well as some large operating companies.",
      "Many types of banks and other financial services businesses don't need to file, according to FinCEN. Some other types of businesses, such as many sole proprietorships, are also exempt, it noted. (A list and Q&A on exemptions can be seen here.)",
      "What may happen next in the CTA case?",
      "It's unclear, but its possible that groups fighting against the regulation could seek relief from the U.S. Supreme Court or ask for the 5th Circuit for additional review, according to the National Law Review.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 19:43:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "Northwest Naturals issued a voluntary recall for a batch of pet food after a cat died of bird flu in Oregon, officials said.",
      "Testing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories and the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed an indoor cat in Oregon's Washington County contracted bird flu and died after eating the pet food.",
      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",
      "Oregon's Department of Agriculture said the cat death is a reminder that giving raw meat products to pets can lead to illness.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 09:37:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "All four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs.",

      "The federal agency claims drivers were forced to use the accounts to get paid and were deceived about how to access their earnings, with Walmart threatening to fire workers who did not comply. Drivers had to follow a complicated process to get their pay, and then faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money into another account.",

      "Both Walmart and Branch vowed a vigorous defense.",
      "\"The CFPB's rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law.

    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

      "Century-old department store Nordstrom has agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal that comes as department stores are facing pressure from discount chains and other competition.",
      "Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they own, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, which is the day before media reports of a potential transaction began to circulate. The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years. Other publicly traded retailers, including Macy's and Kohl's, have faced pressure from major investors in order to provide bigger returns to investors, while also attempting to fend off competition from lower-cost rivals such as Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool. They will likely run the business as a retailer rather than as some kind of financial play thing which, in our view, is a very positive thing for the long term health of the brand.\"",
      "Shares of Nordstrom fell 36 cents, or 1.5%, to $24.17 in late morning trading.",
      "Nordstrom family, El Puerto de Liverpool's offer",
      "That offer announced Monday tops the previous $23-per-share bid that the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group, El Puerto de Liverpool, made in September.",
      "The board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, based on Nordstrom's cash on hand immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction.",
      "The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company's shares will no longer trade publicly.",
      "Nordstrom's board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company \u2014 recusing themselves from that vote.",
      "Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom family will have a majority ownership stake in the company. Erik and Pete Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leadership at the Seattle retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company's chief executive and Peter is president.",
      "After opening 23 new stores so far this year, the company now operates a combined 381 Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S."

      "The Container Store's woes come during what's been a tough year for some bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have seen store closures spike almost 70% this year.

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to join forces, forming world's third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "\"We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\" Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said in a statement.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March.",
      "Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \"desperate move.\"",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Jan. 10 in TikTok's challenge of a law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular platform.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok urged the Supreme Court on Friday to find unconstitutional a new law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular app in the United States, arguing that shuttering TikTok will silence not only its speech, but also that of the platform's more than 170 million American users. President-elect Donald Trump also filed a separate brief in which he stated that he opposes the ban at the current moment and requests time to resolve the dispute via political negotiations.",
      "In an opening brief filed with the justices, which provides a first look at the arguments TikTok will make to the high court next month, lawyers for the platform urged them to reverse a decision from a three-judge appeals court panel that upheld the ban.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok said in their filing that they \"do not contest Congress's compelling interest in protecting this nation's security, or the many weapons it has to do so. But that arsenal simply does not include suppressing the speech of Americans because other Americans may be persuaded.\"",
      "In its own filing\u00a0laying out arguments for upholding the ban, the Justice Department argued the law is consistent with the First Amendment and said the government has a compelling interest in preventing threats to national security posed by control of TikTok by a foreign adversary, China.",
      "The law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote, \"addresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government's control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary. And the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\"",
      "The high court said last week that it would take up TikTok's challenge to the ban, which was passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. The company had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the law and urged it to intervene before Jan. 19, when the prohibition is set to take effect.",
      "The justices said they will consider whether the measure violates the First Amendment, and scheduled two hours of arguments for Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that could bring a ruling soon after. In addition to TikTok's challenge, the Supreme Court will consider a separate bid by a group of the platform's users to block the ban.",
      "The case will be argued in the final days of the Biden administration, but Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has expressed support for TikTok. Trump tried to ban the app during his first term in office, but reversed his position during his campaign. The president-elect vowed to \"save\" the app, and told reporters earlier this month that he has \"a warm spot in my heart for TikTok.\"",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Trump, D. John Sauer, said he opposes banning the platform in the U.S. \"at this juncture\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" Trump announced in November that he plans to nominate Sauer to serve as solicitor general in his second term.",
      "The president-elect asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's Jan. 19 effective date to allow his new administration to \"pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "Citing the Jan. 19 deadline, Trump said it interferes with his \"ability to manage the United States' foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\"",
      "Lawmakers sought to restrict access to TikTok in the U.S. amid concerns about its ties to China. The platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and members from both parties, as well as intelligence agencies, have warned that the app could give the Chinese government access to data from the roughly 170 million Americans who use TikTok. They have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to covertly manipulate content on the platform and influence public dialogue.",
      "Under the law, TikTok had nine months to divest from ByteDance or lose access to all app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The measure allows the president to grant a one-time, 90-day delay if a sale is in progress by Jan. 19.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that divesture is not possible, and the Chinese government has vowed to block the sale of the platform's powerful algorithm, which tailors content recommendations to users.",
      "Brought in May, TikTok argued in its challenge to the law that it violates the First Amendment rights of the platform and its users. The company also said Congress targeted it with its ban, which would bar every American from participating in its \"unique online community.\"",
      "But a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, and found that the government's national security justification for the law is consistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote for the unanimous court. \"Here the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "Ginsburg, joined by Judge Neomi Rao, tapped by Trump, and Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by President Barack Obama, said that while the decision will have significant implications for TikTok and its users, \"that burden is attributable to [China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. government.\"",

      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them.",

    "story": [
      "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) \u2014 Marc Fogel, a Pennsylvania man imprisoned in Russia, has been designated as \"wrongfully detained,\" according to a U.S. Department of State spokesperson.",
      "That designation by the U.S. government was made official in October.",
      "Fogel is currently serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Who is Marc Fogel?",
      "When the Butler County native and his wife flew back to Russia in August 2021 for their 10th and final year of teaching in the country, Marc Fogel was detained at the airport in Moscow after his family said he was carrying 17 grams of cannabis for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "The Oakmont teacher was convicted of drug smuggling and drug possession and sentenced to 14 years at a high-security penal colony in Russia.",
      "Fight to bring Marc Fogel home",
      "Ever since his imprisonment, Marc Fogel's family and lawmakers have been urging lawmakers to bring him home.",
      "In 2022, thousands of people signed a petition calling on the U.S. government to do more to bring him home. Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",
      "In December 2022, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a prisoner swap that included WNBA player Brittney Griner, but Marc Fogel was not included in the deal.",
      "In August, another prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. brought home Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva, but not Marc Fogel.",
      "When President Biden was asked about Marc Fogel in August, he said, \"We're not giving up on that.\"",
      "An attempt was made to include Fogel in the Aug. 1 deal but officials were unable to make it happen.",
      "Malphine Fogel, Marc Fogel's mother,\u00a0has previously criticized the Biden administration\u00a0for not bringing her son home.",
      "\"I might be on borrowed time,\"\u00a0Malphine Fogel told KDKA-TV in July. \"I don't know how much time I have. I want to come home while I still know him.\"",
      "What does wrongfully detained mean?",
      "Wrongfully detained is a designation that puts the full force of the U.S. government behind securing the release of the prisoner.",
      "According to the U.S. Department of State, once a person has been determined to be wrongfully detained, offices \"throughout the State Department and other U.S. government agencies will work collaboratively with colleagues inside and outside the government to develop a strategy to secure their release.\"",
      "Getting the determination is very rare, as most cases of Americans being arrested or detained overseas \"arise out of legitimate law enforcement and judicial processes,\" according to the government.",
      "Malphine Fogel sued the government in June in an effort to get her son home from Russia, but the lawsuit was dismissed on Thursday.",
      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",
      "It also means the case gets transferred to a division known as the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, which is focused on negotiating for the release of detainees and hostages around the world.",
      "But there is no clear timeline on how long it takes to release someone.",
      "What lawmakers are saying about Marc Fogel",
      "Sen. Casey said the designation from the government is an \"important step\" but the U.S. \"must finish the job and bring Marc home.\"",
      "U.S. Rep Chris Deluzio said that \"the fight to free him from his wrongful detention in Russia is not yet over,\" while U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly said the designation \"is long overdue\" before adding that he will work until Marc Fogel is free and reunited with his family.",

      "\"I don't think the U.S. will invade Panama over fees. Now, it may force the Panamanian government to reduce the fees, but if the Panamanian government reduces the fees, it will most likely reduce the fees for everybody (not only the United States).\"",
      "Prior to being a Miami-Dade county commissioner, he was the Florida director of  Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and is a former lobbyist.",
      "In November, he sponsored an initiative that Miami-Dade would recognize Hialeah's creation of President Donald J. Trump Avenue. The county commission approved. Earlier this month, the commission overwhelmingly passed 9-1. the name change for the 4-mile road.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States take over the Panama Canal, a shipping waterway that cuts across Central America, unless fees for using the canal are lowered.",
      "Panama's leader shot back in a recent statement, saying the waterway is not for sale. Since then, Trump has posted repeatedly about the canal.",
      "It's the latest in a series of similar statements from Trump, who recently suggested the United States take over Greenland, an idea he also floated during his first presidency. He's also joked about Canada\u00a0being a U.S. state.",
      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",

      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \"unreasonable delay,\" she said.",

      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club.

      "The bald eagle is emblematic of America. It's on coins and bills, graces the Great Seal and inspired conservation efforts that brought the species back from the brink of extinction. Though it was first used as the national symbol more than 240 years ago, Congress had never made it official.",
      "That changed earlier this year. And on Christmas Eve,\u00a0President Biden signed\u00a0the legislation declaring the bald eagle the official national bird.",
      "\"For nearly 250 years, we called the bald eagle the national bird when it wasn't,\" said Jack Davis, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center, in a release. \"But now the title is official, and no bird is more deserving.\"",
      "It's been a long road for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the bald eagle's scientific name, known for its striking white head and yellow beak atop its brown body. Native to the U.S., populations of the bird \u2014 which eats fish and carrion, but was also known to prey on livestock, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 first declined due to habitat and prey loss.",
      "But it was the introduction of the pesticide DDT that contributed to the birds' near-disappearance in the 20th century. When the birds ate fish that had been exposed to the chemical, they laid eggs with weak shells. Those eggs didn't survive incubation, and populations declined to a mere 417 nesting pairs by 1963, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The U.S. banned DDT in 1972 and, a few years later, declared bald eagles endangered. Over the next few decades, the bald eagle\u00a0populations recovered. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000 nesting pairs in the U.S. and bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of bald eagles in recent years in the hundreds of thousands. In recent years, bald eagles have charmed\u00a0birdwatchers in the heart of New York City, and eagle cams have popped up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania and in California's Big Bear Valley.",
      "The legislation\u00a0designating the bald eagle as the U.S. national bird was spearheaded by Minnesota legislators. The state is home to what Sen. Amy Klobuchar described as one of the nation's largest bald eagle populations.",

      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",

      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",

Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday vetoed a once-bipartisan effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered about the life-tenured positions.",
      "The legislation would have spread the establishment of the new trial court judgeships over more than a decade to give three presidential administrations and six Congresses the chance to appoint the new judges. The bipartisan effort was carefully designed so that lawmakers wouldn't knowingly give an advantage to either political party in shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure unanimously in August. But the Republican-led House brought it to the floor only after Republican Donald Trump was reelected to a second term as president in November, adding the veneer of political gamesmanship to the process.",
      "The White House had said at the time that Mr. Biden would veto the bill.",
      "\"The House of Representative's hurried action fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships,\" the president said in a statement.",
      "\"The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that these questions about need and allocation be further studied and answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said the bill would also have created new judgeships in states where senators haven't filled existing judicial vacancies and that those efforts \"suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.",
      "\"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill,\" Mr. Biden said, essentially dooming the legislation for the current Congress. Overturning his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the House vote fell well short of that margin.",
      "Organizations representing judges and attorneys had urged Congress to vote for the bill. They argued that the lack of new federal judgeships had contributed to profound delays in the resolution of cases and serious concerns about access to justice.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., reacted swiftly, calling the veto a \"misguided decision\" and \"another example of why Americans are counting down the days until President Biden leaves the White House.\" He alluded to a full pardon Mr. Biden recently granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges.",
      "\"The President is more enthusiastic about using his office to provide relief to his family members who received due process than he is about giving relief to the millions of regular Americans who are waiting years for their due process,\" Young asserted. \"Biden's legacy will be 'pardons for me, no justice for thee.'\"",
      "The Senate confirmed two more of Mr. Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday \u2014 giving him a total of 235 since he took office and surpassing\u00a0the number of federal judges\u00a0approved during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Biden said in a statement at that time: \"Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water.

      "\"This was an attempt to 'thought police,' and this victory over totalitarianism is a testament to the courage of librarians, booksellers, and readers who refused to bow to intimidation,\" said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.",

    "summary": "President Biden left in place the capital punishment sentences of just three federal inmates: Robert Bowers, Dzhokar Tsarnaev and Dylann Roof.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday announced he had commuted the sentences of nearly all federal inmates on death row, with the exception of three who did not receive clemency.",
      "There are 37 inmates initially sentenced to death who will be impacted by Mr. Biden's action and will now receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. But the remaining three on death row whose sentences are untouched are: Robert Bowers, convicted for the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue; Dylann Roof, convicted of the shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for the Boston Marathon bombing.",
      "While Mr. Biden campaigned on ending capital punishment and the Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions, prosecutors still sought the death penalty in some cases.",
      "Robert Bowers",
      "Bowers, 51, received the death penalty in August 2023 after he was convicted of 63 federal counts for the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Bowers shot and killed 11 worshipers and wounded seven people in the deadliest antisemetic attack in U.S. history.",
      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers. Federal prosecutors said he turned the synagogue into a \"killing ground,\" and police said Bowers told them \"all Jews need to die.\"",
      "The Justice Department said Bowers \"meticulously planned\" the attack based on his antisemitic beliefs.",
      "Dylann Roof",
      "A jury sentenced Roof to death in 2017 for the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, making him the first person ordered to be executed for a federal hate crime. Nine Black parishioners were killed and three were wounded in the attack, which took place during a Bible study.",
      "Prosecutors said before Roof mounted the racially motivated assault, he posted a manifesto online that used racial slurs and expressed a belief that White people are superior to African Americans. They said Roof wanted to attack Black worshipers to stoke racial conflict.",
      "Roof was convicted of 33 counts in 2016. He appealed his conviction, with his attorneys arguing that Roof was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. But a federal appeals court upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence in 2021.",
      "\"Dylann Roof murdered African Americans at their church, during their Bible study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered them. He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to review\u00a0the 4th Circuit's decision in 2022.",
      "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev",
      "Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 counts for crimes committed during the bombings near the finish line at the Boston Marathon in 2013, including three counts of using a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.",
      "The jury recommended, and a federal district court imposed, the death penalty on six of 17 capital counts.",
      "Three people were killed and scores more were injured during the attack. Tsarnaev's role in the bombing is not disputed \u2014 his attorneys acknowledged he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two homemade explosive devices near the finish line of the marathon. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",
      "The two brothers attempted to flee Massachusetts following the attack, sparking a four-day manhunt that put Boston and the surrounding areas on lockdown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested by police after he was discovered hiding out in a boat behind a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police during their pursuit of the two brothers.",
      "After appealing his convictions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld nearly all of them in 2020, with the exception of three, and it invalidated those capital sentences and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the 1st Circuit's decision, arguing a new sentencing proceeding would impose significant burdens on the victims of the 2013 bombing. The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.",
      "The Supreme Court in March 2022 reinstated the death sentence, finding the appeals court improperly tossed out his capital sentences.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee on Monday released its\u00a0highly anticipated report\u00a0on the findings of its investigation into former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, detailing allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and obstruction.",
      "Gaetz has denied wrongdoing. But the report says \"[t]he Committee determined there is substantial evidence\" that he \"violated House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"",
      "Gaetz filed a federal lawsuit earlier Monday seeking to block the release of the report, arguing that the committee no longer has jurisdiction since he left office, but the committee released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz, who was first elected in 2016, resigned from Congress last month after being selected by President-elect Donald Trump as his pick for attorney general. Days later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, facing opposition\u00a0 to his confirmation from Senate Republicans.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the House Ethics Committee's report:",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz had sex with a minor",
      "The committee says in its report that there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a minor, detailing two alleged encounters with a 17-year-old girl at a party in 2017 when the former congressman was 35, in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
      "The committee said it obtained testimony from the girl, identified as \"Victim A,\" as well as other witnesses who corroborated the allegations. The report also notes that evidence suggests Gaetz was not aware that the girl was 17 until more than a month after the sexual encounters. Victim A had just completed her junior year of high school when the encounter occurred, the report says.",
      "The report says Gaetz maintained contact with Victim A, and less than six months after she turned 18, he \"met up with her again for commercial sex.\" Victim A said she received $400 from Gaetz that was understood to be payment for sex at the party, the committee said.",
      "Gaetz has previously denied these allegations and has not been charged with a crime. In a recent post on X, he wrote: \"I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18.\u00a0 Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court - which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz paid women for sex",
      "The report found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz paid women for sex and had others pay them on his behalf, in violation of Florida state law.",
      "The report lists payments to 12 different women totaling more than $90,000 between 2017 and 2020, paid via check or apps like PayPal, Venmo and CashApp.",
      "The report notes that there was no evidence that the sex acts were \"induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "One of the women testified that she met up with Gaetz at a hotel, where he was with another man and a 20-year-old woman, and there was an \"expectation\" of a \"sexual encounter,\" after which he gave her a $750 check with \"tuition reimbursement\" written in the memo line. She told the committee that on other occasions \"he had normally sent Venmo payments.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied paying for sex. He wrote on X: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used illegal drugs",
      "The report says there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz used illegal drugs between 2017 to 2019, including cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana, in violation of state laws.",
      "A number of women understood Gaetz to be a regular user of ecstasy, the report says, while some noted that they had seen him use ecstasy and cocaine at different events. The report says Gaetz appeared to set up a \"pseudonymous e-mail account from his House office in the Capitol complex for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\"",
      "The committee noted that it also received evidence that Gaetz provided drugs to",
      "women to facilitate sexual encounters.",
      "Gaetz wrote on X: \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life.\u00a0 I live a different life now.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz accepted luxury travel gifts in violation of House rules",
      "The committee outlines \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz accepted gifts exceeding the amount allowed under House rules, in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas.",
      "Lawmakers are required to apply to the committee for a waiver in order to accept gifts that surpass a certain cost threshold. The committee said for Gaetz, a flight on a private plane, lodging, meal expenses and entertainment expenses on the trip exceeded the limit.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used the power of his office to help a sexual partner get an expedited passport",
      "The panel alleges that Gaetz falsely indicated to the State Department that a woman whom he had engaged in sexual activity with was a constituent, and asked his chief of staff to assist her in getting a passport on an expedited basis.",
      "\"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases,\" the report says, calling it a violation of House regulations and laws governing the use of official resources.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz tried to obstruct the committee's investigation",
      "The report says Gaetz was uncooperative throughout the committee's investigation, provided \"minimal documentation\" in response to its requests, and did not agree to a voluntary interview or appear before the committee after a subpoena for his testimony.",
      "The committee says it found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in \"obstructive conduct\" when it came to the investigation.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz pointed to evidence that would 'exonerate' him yet failed to produce any such materials,\" the report says. \"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote.

    "story": [
      "A retired Washington, D.C., police officer\u00a0was convicted Monday of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the far-right Proud Boys.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson convicted former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond, who used to supervise the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau, of obstructing justice and making false statements after a trial without a jury.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond was convicted on all four counts. He was charged with leaking information to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "At his bench trial, Lamond testified that he had never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio testified as a witness for Lamond's defense and said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn't receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find the testimony of either Lamond or Tarrio to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the banner burning.",
      "\"It was the other way around,\" she said.",
      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",
      "After the verdict, defense attorney Mark Schamel said it was premature to say if there would be an appeal.",
      "\"It's unbelievably disappointing to see every single thing that Lt. Lamond did viewed through a lens to make it appear to be something other than it was,\" Schamel said outside the courtroom. \"There is nothing disloyal about him at all, and it's a sad day for him.\"",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",

    "summary": "Tahlequah has a newborn girl, years after she made headlines for carrying her dead calf for 17 days.",
    "story": [
      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

    "story": [
      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

      "Parker got more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, traveling at a maximum speed of about 430,000 mph. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).",
      "It will continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Since it was launched, Parker has been using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.",
      "Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the sun's surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun.",
      "The\u00a0Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Before this week's historic milestone, Parker had flown straight through the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse.",

      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",
      "Experts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money \u2014 a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.",
      "\"It's great to have a vision where we're melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,\" Shah said. \"But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?\"",

    "story": [
      "The world's top chess player quit a major tournament in New York City after officials told him he couldn't wear jeans to compete.",
      "Magnus Carlsen, 34, was competing in the International Chess Federation (FIDE)'s World Blitz Chess Championship and the World Rapid Chess Championship. During these events, chess players compete under specific time rules. Carlsen won both tournaments in both 2022 and 2023. He has won the Blitz Chess Championship seven times and the Rapid Chess Championship five times in the past 10 years.",
      "The 2024 events began on Thursday. Carlsen arrived at Friday's events in jeans, which officials said is \"explicitly prohibited\" under the federation's regulations for the event. Carlsen said he was coming from a lunch meeting and had played several rounds before officials told him he had to change, according to CBS News partner BBC News.",
      "Carlsen was told he would be fined $200, and was asked to change his clothes, the federation said. Carlsen declined to do so but offered to change for the next day. When that offer was refused, Carlsen said it \"became a bit of a matter of principle,\" according to the BBC.",
      "Carlsen was not permitted to play in the tournament's ninth round, disqualifying him from further participation. Carlsen said he would not appeal the decision, according to the BBC. He later shared a photo of himself in jeans, a blazer and blue shirt on social media, captioning it \"OOTD,\" an acronym for \"outfit of the day.\"",
      "OOTD pic.twitter.com/9reOP6zuJv",
      "The federation said in a statement shared on social media that dress code rules are made clear to participants, are communicated ahead of each event, and are \"designed to ensure professionalism and fairness for all participants.\" The events were also within a \"short walking distance\" from the players' accommodations, the federation said, \"making adherence to the rules more convenient.",
      "Earlier in the day, another player, Ian Nepomniachtchi, was fined for breaching the dress code by wearing sports shoes, the federation said. Nepomniachtchi changed his shoes and was allowed to continue playing in the tournament, officials said.",
      "The tournament will conclude on Saturday.",
      "This is not the first time Carlsen, who became a chess grandmaster at 13, has drawn controversy. He accused American player Hans Niemann of cheating after Niemann beat him in a tournament. A week later, the two were paired in an online chess game, which Carlsen quit after just one move. Niemann, who had previously admitted to cheating in online games, denied Carlsen's allegations. Carlsen said he believed the American player had cheated more than he had admitted. The pair settled a $100 million lawsuit in August 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Wyoming will sell a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) parcel of pristine land bordering Grand Teton National Park to the U.S. government for $100 million after Gov. Mark Gordon signed off on a deal Friday that ends the state's longstanding threats to unload it to a developer.",

      "Gordon, a Republican, announced in a statement that he was approving the deal to add the land to the national park after his office ensured that a U.S. Bureau of Land Management plan for managing a vast area of southwestern Wyoming doesn't carry too many restrictions on development including oil and gas drilling \u2014 a stipulation made by the state Legislature last winter.",
      "Even so, Gordon criticized the BLM's overall plan for the arid, minerals-rich area 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of Grand Teton as \"the Biden administration's parting shot\" at the state.",

It is the last and most valuable of four state-owned parcels sold to be annexed by the park in the past decade.",
      "The federal government granted such lands to many states, particularly in the West, at statehood to help raise money for public education. Despite the location and astronomical value of the parcels, they brought in relatively little revenue for the state through grazing leases and other uses.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "But Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign.",
      "He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Jan. 10 in TikTok's challenge of a law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular platform.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok urged the Supreme Court on Friday to find unconstitutional a new law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular app in the United States, arguing that shuttering TikTok will silence not only its speech, but also that of the platform's more than 170 million American users. President-elect Donald Trump also filed a separate brief in which he stated that he opposes the ban at the current moment and requests time to resolve the dispute via political negotiations.",
      "In an opening brief filed with the justices, which provides a first look at the arguments TikTok will make to the high court next month, lawyers for the platform urged them to reverse a decision from a three-judge appeals court panel that upheld the ban.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok said in their filing that they \"do not contest Congress's compelling interest in protecting this nation's security, or the many weapons it has to do so. But that arsenal simply does not include suppressing the speech of Americans because other Americans may be persuaded.\"",
      "In its own filing\u00a0laying out arguments for upholding the ban, the Justice Department argued the law is consistent with the First Amendment and said the government has a compelling interest in preventing threats to national security posed by control of TikTok by a foreign adversary, China.",
      "The law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote, \"addresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government's control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary. And the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\"",
      "The high court said last week that it would take up TikTok's challenge to the ban, which was passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. The company had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the law and urged it to intervene before Jan. 19, when the prohibition is set to take effect.",
      "The justices said they will consider whether the measure violates the First Amendment, and scheduled two hours of arguments for Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that could bring a ruling soon after. In addition to TikTok's challenge, the Supreme Court will consider a separate bid by a group of the platform's users to block the ban.",
      "The case will be argued in the final days of the Biden administration, but Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has expressed support for TikTok. Trump tried to ban the app during his first term in office, but reversed his position during his campaign. The president-elect vowed to \"save\" the app, and told reporters earlier this month that he has \"a warm spot in my heart for TikTok.\"",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Trump, D. John Sauer, said he opposes banning the platform in the U.S. \"at this juncture\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" Trump announced in November that he plans to nominate Sauer to serve as solicitor general in his second term.",
      "The president-elect asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's Jan. 19 effective date to allow his new administration to \"pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "Citing the Jan. 19 deadline, Trump said it interferes with his \"ability to manage the United States' foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\"",
      "Lawmakers sought to restrict access to TikTok in the U.S. amid concerns about its ties to China. The platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and members from both parties, as well as intelligence agencies, have warned that the app could give the Chinese government access to data from the roughly 170 million Americans who use TikTok. They have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to covertly manipulate content on the platform and influence public dialogue.",
      "Under the law, TikTok had nine months to divest from ByteDance or lose access to all app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The measure allows the president to grant a one-time, 90-day delay if a sale is in progress by Jan. 19.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that divesture is not possible, and the Chinese government has vowed to block the sale of the platform's powerful algorithm, which tailors content recommendations to users.",
      "Brought in May, TikTok argued in its challenge to the law that it violates the First Amendment rights of the platform and its users. The company also said Congress targeted it with its ban, which would bar every American from participating in its \"unique online community.\"",
      "But a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, and found that the government's national security justification for the law is consistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote for the unanimous court. \"Here the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "Ginsburg, joined by Judge Neomi Rao, tapped by Trump, and Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by President Barack Obama, said that while the decision will have significant implications for TikTok and its users, \"that burden is attributable to [China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. government.\"",

    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",

      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

After a three-month pause the\u00a0Kilauea Volcano\u00a0in Hawaii started erupting on Dec. 23, the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.",
      "The toddler had wandered off from his family \"in a split second,\" park officials said, as they were admiring the lava glow within Kaluapele - the Kilauea caldera - at sunset on Dec. 23. He ran straight toward the 400-foot cliff edge and his screaming mother managed to grab him in the nick of time just a foot or so away from a fatal fall, officials said.",
      "\"The hazards that coincide with an eruption are dangerous, and we have safety measures in place including closed areas, barriers, closure signs, and traffic management,\" Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh said in a statement. \"Your safety is our utmost concern, but we rely on everyone to recreate responsibility. National parks showcase nature's splendor but they are not playgrounds.\"",
      "Park officials said the family was behind a closed area beyond the post-and-cable barrier at K\u012blauea Overlook. Officials reminded visitors to stay on the trail, stay out of closed areas and to keep their children close - especially when watching K\u012blauea from viewpoints along Crater Rim Trail.",
      "The volcano eruption from Dec. 23rd has entered its second pause, said the UGSG, but eruptions could start any time. Toxic gas emissions are still high and can be particularly dangerous for children. Volcanic gas includes sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide.",
      "The December 2024 eruption - had lava fountains as high as 262 feet with molten material - and was the fifth eruption at Kilauea since December 2020. Roughly 400 acres of the caldera floor was covered in lava, according to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.",
      "The last eruption on\u00a0Kilauea was in June 2024\u00a0and lasted about five days. The volcano also erupted in September 2023 and lasted for a week, according\u00a0to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

    "story": [
      "More than 2 years after Tennessee abruptly halted the execution of inmate Oscar Smith \u2014 admitting that correction officials were not following their own execution protocols \u2014 the state has announced a new method that could allow it to resume executions halted since May 2022. But that won't happen right away.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction announced in a brief statement Friday it had \"completed its revision of the lethal injection protocol, which will utilize the single drug pentobarbital.\" The Department did not immediately release the new protocol to the public or give any further details.",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender's habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee's death row inmates, said the announcement was \"notable for its lack of detail.\"",
      "\"The secrecy which shrouds the execution protocol in Tennessee is what allowed TDOC to perform executions in violation of their own protocol while simultaneously misrepresenting their actions to the courts and the public,\" Henry said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "Smith was convicted of fatally stabbing his estranged wife and her sons decades ago. He was initially set to be executed in June 2020, but it was delayed because of the pandemic. Shortly before the 2022 date, his attorneys asked Gov. Bill Lee for clemency, citing jury problems in the 1990 trial, but Lee declined to intervene. The U.S. Supreme Court also declined to take up the case.",
      "Smith's 11th-hour reprieve from execution came after Henry requested the results of required purity and potency tests for the lethal injection drugs that were to be used on him. Documents obtained through a public records request later showed that at least two people knew that the lethal injection drugs the state planned to use hadn't undergone some required testing. A subsequent independent review found the state had has not complied with its own lethal injection process ever since it was revised in 2018.",
      "Commissioner Frank Strada took over the Correction Department in January 2023, the same month its top attorney and inspector general were fired. Strada said in Friday's statement he is \"confident the lethal injection process can proceed in compliance with departmental policy and state laws.\"",
      "Henry noted that death row inmates have an ongoing lawsuit in federal court challenging Tennessee's previous lethal injection protocol, which used three different drugs in series. They put the case on hold pending the state's review and revision of the procedure. Their agreement with the state gives them 90 days to look over the new protocol and decide whether to amend their complaint to challenge it.",
      "Henry said no new execution dates should be set while their court case is ongoing. She also noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is currently reviewing the use of pentobarbital in its executions.",

Israel's military alleged that Hamas militants were using the facility and said over 240 people were detained.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry said Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, was arrested Friday along with dozens of other staff and taken to an interrogation center. The ministry said Israeli troops stormed the hospital and forced many staff and patients outside and told them to strip in winter weather, according to the ministry.",

It said it encircled the hospital and special forces entered and found weapons in the area. It said militants fired on its forces and they were \"eliminated.\"",
      "On Friday, the military denied it had entered or set fire to the hospital complex but acknowledged it had ordered people outside. The military repeated claims that Hamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan but provided no evidence. Hospital officials have denied that.",
      "The hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli troops waging an offensive in largely isolated northern Gaza against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped. The health ministry said a strike on the hospital earlier this week killed five medical personnel.",
      "MedGlobal, the humanitarian organization for which Abu Safiya worked, said Friday it was gravely concerned about him. It said the incident follows the October detention of five other staff, calling it an \"alarming and egregious pattern of targeting medical personnel and spaces.\"",
      "Israel's nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and ground offensives has devastated Gaza's health sector. The World Health Organization has said the raid on Kamal Adwan has put northern Gaza's last major health facility \"out of service\" after growing restrictions on access, adding that \"this horror must end and health care must be protected.\"",
      "The Health Ministry said conditions for Kamal Adwan patients who were relocated to the damaged Indonesian Hospital nearby \u2014 also raided in the past \u2014 were \"extremely difficult.\"",
      "The Israeli military statement Saturday said 350 patients along with medical personnel had been evacuated from Kamal Adwan in recent weeks, and another 95 patients, caregivers, and medical personnel were evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital during the operation. It also said it had provided fuel and medical supplies to both hospitals.",
      "The war has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, and wounded more than 108,000 others, according to the Health Ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",
      "Since October, Israel's offensive has virtually sealed off the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and leveled large parts of them. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced out but thousands are believed to remain in the area where Kamal Adwan and two other hospitals are located.",
      "Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which they killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Some 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, and around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel continued attacks across Gaza on Saturday. An overnight strike killed at least nine people in Maghazi, including women and children, according to staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where they were taken and an Associated Press reporter who saw the bodies.",
      "Men cried as the bodies, wrapped in bloodied white plastic, lay on the floor of the morgue.",
      "The Health Ministry said Saturday that 48 people had been killed in the past 24 hours by Israeli fire.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel said its troops had begun operating in the northern city of Beit Hanoun, citing intelligence that fighters and Hamas infrastructure were in the area.",
      "Strikes also continued in Israel. Air raid sirens sounded early Saturday and the military said it intercepted a missile fired by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",

      "That designation by the U.S. government was made official in October.",
      "Fogel is currently serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Who is Marc Fogel?",
      "When the Butler County native and his wife flew back to Russia in August 2021 for their 10th and final year of teaching in the country, Marc Fogel was detained at the airport in Moscow after his family said he was carrying 17 grams of cannabis for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "The Oakmont teacher was convicted of drug smuggling and drug possession and sentenced to 14 years at a high-security penal colony in Russia.",
      "Fight to bring Marc Fogel home",
      "Ever since his imprisonment, Marc Fogel's family and lawmakers have been urging lawmakers to bring him home.",
      "In 2022, thousands of people signed a petition calling on the U.S. government to do more to bring him home. Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",
      "In December 2022, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a prisoner swap that included WNBA player Brittney Griner, but Marc Fogel was not included in the deal.",
      "In August, another prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. brought home Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva, but not Marc Fogel.",

      "Malphine Fogel sued the government in June in an effort to get her son home from Russia, but the lawsuit was dismissed on Thursday.",
      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",
      "It also means the case gets transferred to a division known as the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, which is focused on negotiating for the release of detainees and hostages around the world.",
      "But there is no clear timeline on how long it takes to release someone.",
      "What lawmakers are saying about Marc Fogel",
      "Sen. Casey said the designation from the government is an \"important step\" but the U.S. \"must finish the job and bring Marc home.\"",

    "title": "Experts doubt Russian claims of bird strike in Kazakhstan plane crash",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 13:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say evidence in the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash in Kazakhstan points to a possible midair explosion, not an encounter with a flock of birds.",
    "story": [
      "Speculation was mounting Friday that Russia's military could have had a role in the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash that killed 38 people and left 29 survivors injured in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day, with experts casting doubt on Moscow's suggestion that a bird strike was to blame.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, an Embraer 190 aircraft, was flying from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the city of Grozny in Russia's North Caucasus region Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that were still unclear two days later. At some point during the flight the plane's GPS tracking was reportedly jammed, leading to significant deviations in the flightpath.",
      "The plane crashed while trying to reach another airport in Aktau, in western Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. It came down and burst into a ball of flames only about two miles from the Aktau airport.",
      "Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia all opened investigations into the cause of the crash, but it was Russia facing the most pointed questions two days later. The Kremlin has urged people not to jump to conclusions, and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, who's forged closer ties between his country and Russia during his two decades in power, also said it was too soon to speculate.",
      "\"The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,\" he said, as Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, suggested the bird strike theory.",
      "But a U.S. official told CBS News there were early indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the plane in a region where Ukrainian and Russian forces have traded drone and rocket fire for months. The official, who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity, said if that proved to be true, it would further underscore Russia's recklessness in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday that U.S. officials \"have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.\"",
      "He confirmed to reporters the United States has intelligence or information pointing to the possibility but said Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are currently conducting an investigation and the U.S. will \"respect that process.\"",
      "Kirby said President Biden has been apprised of the situation and the United States has offered assistance to the Azerbaijani government.",
      "\"We stand ready and willing to help them, should they need it with their investigation,\" he said.",
      "Independent aviation experts were also casting doubt on the bird strike theory, and pointing to damage seen on the plane's fuselage as evidence of a more nefarious possible explanation.",
      "\"It certainly does not look like a flock of birds,\" said CBS News aviation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "\"Birds don't fly at the type of an altitude that the initial damage occurred on this airplane,\" added Sumwalt.",
      "\u00adInstead, the damage bears the hallmarks of shrapnel from an airborne weapon, and British military veteran and security analyst Justin Crump told CBS News' partner network BBC News that \"the most likely hypothesis is that it was struck by an air defense missile \u2014 almost certainly Russian.\"",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines and Russia react to crash in Kazakhstan",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines, in a statement reported by international news agencies on Friday, said the plane experienced \"external physical and technical interference\" during its flight, without offering further information.",
      "Dmitry Yadrov, the head of Russia's national aviation agency Rosaviatsia, said in a statement Friday that the Azerbaijani plane crashed during or after a Ukrainian drone attack around Grozny, where it had been scheduled to land. According to The Associated Press, Yadrov said \"the situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult\" at the time, citing both the purported Ukrainian drone attack and heavy fog in the region.",
      "He did not specifically address claims that the passenger jet had been hit by Russian air defenses.",
      "Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also declined to comment Friday on the claims of possible Russian involvement in the crash, saying it would be up to investigators to determine the cause.",
      "Some survivors of the crash said they heard an explosion before the plane went down.",
      "\"Ukrainian drones were active at the time, and this is commensurate with everything we've seen with the pilots' communication with air traffic control,\" Crump told the BBC.",
      "Ukraine has relied heavily on explosive drones to hit Russian military and infrastructure targets inside the much larger neighboring country's western territory over the last year, and Russia often shoots the weapons down with its air defense systems.",
      "For many observers, the circumstances of the Azerbaijan Airlines crash and the damage to the plane's wreckage recalled the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014. That passenger jet was hit by a missile launched by Russian-backed forces over Eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. \u00a0 Among those desperate for answers in the most recent disaster in Kazakhstan are the survivors of the crash, including one man who said from a hospital bed that he's been sitting next to his wife on the plane when it crashed.",
      "\"I haven't seen my wife since,\" he said. \u00a0 Investigators have recovered both of the so-called \"black boxes\" \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 from the crash site. Experts from Brazil, where the plane was built, were due to arrive in Kazakhstan Friday to help retrieve and analyze the information from them.",
      "As the formal investigations ramped up, Ukraine's government called on Friday for Russia to be held accountable for the crash, as Azerbaijan Airlines reportedly halted scheduled services to seven cities in Russia.",

    "summary": "Israel says it is targeting Houthi military sites in Yemen's rebel-held capital city, Sanaa.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military said airstrikes in Yemen on Thursday targeted the Houthi rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida. The World Health Organization's director-general said the bombardment occurred as he was about to board a flight in Sanaa, injuring a crew member. Israel's army later told The Associated Press it wasn't aware that the WHO chief was at the location.",
      "\"The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge \u2014 just a few meters from where we were \u2014 and the runway were damaged,\" WHO's Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, adding that he and his colleagues were safe. \"We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave.\" He didn't mention the source of the bombardment.",
      "Tedros said at least two people were killed in the attack at the airport. On Friday, he said in a short message posted on social media that, along with the injured member of his flight crew, the WHO entourage had been evacuated to Jordan, where the wounded United Nations Humanitarian Air Service member would receive further medical treatment.",
      "\"Deepest gratitude to the UNHAS team for their service and swift evacuation from #Yemen, where we were on a UN mission to negotiate for the release of detained colleagues,\" Tedros said, adding: \"Attacks on civilians and humanitarians must stop, everywhere.\"",
      "According to BBC News, video from inside the airport showed panicked people running out of the terminal immediately after the strike.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Yemen came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"the Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad's regime and others learned.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said targets included \"military infrastructure used by the Houthi terrorist regime for its military activities in both the Sana'a International Airport and the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations,\" as well as other military infrastructure at several ports.",
      "The Iran-backed Houthis' media outlet confirmed the strikes in a Telegram post but gave no immediate details. Houthi media said three people were killed in the strikes and 14 injured.",
      "The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen for months, including in recent days, in response to the group's regular missile and drone attacks on international commercial and military ships and on Israel. Israeli officials said yet another Houthi-launched missile was intercepted by air defense systems Friday before it reached Israeli territory.",
      "The United Nations has noted that the rebel-held ports in Yemen are important entryways for humanitarian aid to the impoverished nation. According to BBC News, Tedros was in Yemen to assess the humanitarian situation there, in addition to trying to negotiate the release of detained U.N. staff in the country.",
      "Over the weekend, 16 people were wounded when a Houthi missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv. Last week, Israeli jets struck Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people, calling it a response to previous Houthi attacks. The Houthis also have been targeting shipping on the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Israeli strike outside hospital in Gaza",
      "Meanwhile, an Israeli strike killed five Palestinians outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the territory's Health Ministry said. Gaza officials said they were journalists working for a local news outlet. The Israeli military said they were militants posing as reporters.",
      "The strike hit a car outside Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian Journalists Union said the victims were working for the local news outlet Al-Quds Today, a television channel affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group, Reuters reported.",
      "Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme ally of Hamas and took part in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel, which ignited the war. The Israeli military identified four of the men as combat propagandists and said that intelligence, including a list of Islamic Jihad operatives found by soldiers in Gaza, had confirmed that all five were affiliated with the group.",
      "Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian militant groups operate political, media and charitable operations in addition to their armed wings.",
      "Associated Press footage showed the incinerated shell of a van, with press markings visible on the back doors. Sobbing young men attended the funeral outside the hospital. The bodies were wrapped in shrouds, with blue press vests draped over them.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists says that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel hasn't allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza except on military embeds.",
      "Israel has banned the pan-Arab Al Jazeera network and accused six of its Gaza reporters of being militants. The Qatar-based broadcaster denies the allegations and accuses Israel of trying to silence its war coverage, which has focused heavily on civilian casualties from Israeli military operations.",
      "Separately, Israel's military said that a 35-year-old reserve soldier was killed during fighting in central Gaza early Thursday. A total of 389 soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation more than a year ago.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in an attack on nearby army bases, farming communities and a music festival. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. About 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's air and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and driven around 90% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast, with little protection from the cold, wet winter.",
      "Also Thursday, people mourned eight Palestinians killed by Israeli military operations in and around the city of Tulkarem in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli military said troops opened fire after militants attacked soldiers, and said it was aware of uninvolved civilians who were harmed in the raid.",

      "Italy's government said Friday that a journalist from the country had been detained by Iranian authorities for a week and that the circumstances of her detention remained unclear. The Italian Foreign Ministry is working with Iranian officials to \"clarify the legal situation of Cecilia Sala and to verify the conditions of her detention,\" according to a statement from the ministry.",
      "Sala was in Iran reporting for the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, according to an article published by the outlet on Friday, when she was detained on Dec. 19. The newspaper's editor called for her immediate release in the article, saying \"journalism is not a crime.\"",
      "\"Cecilia was in Iran, with a regular visa, to tell the story of a country she knows and loves, a country where information is suffocated by repression, threats, intimidation, violence, detentions, often against journalists themselves,\" Il Foglio editor Claudio Cerasa said in the article.",
      "He said the newspaper only decided to publish a story about Sala's detention after receiving \"assurances from the heads of our diplomacy that informing readers of the news of her arrest would not slow down diplomatic efforts to bring her home.\"",
      "Iran's government had not acknowledged Sala's arrest by Friday, and none of the country's official media outlets were reporting about it. Some Iranian analysts who spoke with CBS News on the condition they remain anonymous noted that Sala could have been detained to use as a bargaining chip in negotiations over two Iranian nationals detained in recent months in Italy over alleged sanctions violations.",
      "In its statement, the Italian Foreign Ministry said Sala was detained by Tehran police while \"in Iran to carry out journalistic services.\" The ministry said Italian Ambassador Paola Amadei had made a consular visit \"to verify the conditions and state of detention\" of Sala.",
      "The ministry did not confirm that she was being held at Iran's notorious Evin Prison outside Tehran, as reported by Il Foglio. It said her family had been \"informed of the results of the consular visit,\" without providing any further details.",

      "Suzuki was known for his candid remarks and friendliness, calling himself an \"old guy from a small to mid-size company.\" He became CEO of Suzuki in 1978 and was leading the company when it became the first Japanese automaker to start local production in India, where its cars proved hugely popular.",
      "Born on Jan. 30, 1930 as Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki worked in banking after graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University School of Law. He joined Suzuki Motor, which is based in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu, in 1958 when he married a daughter of the company's then-president Shunzo Suzuki, who belonged to the company's founding family.

    "summary": "Researchers say human-caused climate change dealt people an average of nearly six weeks of extra extreme heat in 2024, while also fueling more destructive storms.",
    "story": [
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record. Heat across the globe likely made 2024 the hottest year ever measured and contributed to a slew of other fatal weather events that spared few.",
      "\"The finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\" Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings.",
      "\"As long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse,\" Otto warned.",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures.",
      "Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change, they found.",
      "\"The poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\" said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\"People don't have to die in heat waves. But if we can't communicate convincingly, 'but actually a lot of people are dying,' it's much harder to raise this awareness,\" Otto said. \"Heat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\"",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that, in aggregate, killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. However, the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn't involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\"Extreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Program said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "\"Countries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad",
      "The warnings come amid concern in many countries that the U.S. government, under President-elect Donald Trump, will\u00a0start to roll back commitments\u00a0made by Washington in January to slash greenhouse gas emissions and work toward transitioning to more sustainable energy production.",
      "Trump has made it clear that\u00a0he believes fears about climate change are overblown, and he's previously dismissed the notion of human-caused global warming as a hoax. In his first term as president, Trump overturned\u00a0100 environmental rules\u00a0enacted by his predecessor Barack Obama.",

      "Han's impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country's top two officials worsen its political turmoil, deepen its economic uncertainty and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han's impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and gathered around the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated and shouted that the vote was \"invalid\" and demanded Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported.",

Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president's impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",
      "Han's powers will be officially suspended when copies of his impeachment document are delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, will take over.",
      "Agence France-Presse points out that PPP leader Kweon Seong-dong said after the vote that Han \"must continue to lead state affairs without yielding to the opposition's passage of the impeachment motion.\"",
      "But Han said in a statement that he \"respects the parliament's decision\" and would wait for the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision whether to uphold it.",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon's martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party's demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon's impeachment. That's a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon's ouster. Yoon's political allies in the governing People Power Party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn't exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn't appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. The Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon's decree.",

      "A Japanese death-row inmate, dubbed the \"Black Widow\" after she used cyanide to kill her elderly lovers, has died in a detention center at age 78, officials said on Friday.",
      "Chisako Kakehi was sentenced to death for the murder of three men, including her husband, and the attempted murder of another man about a decade ago in a case that gripped Japan.",
      "Her death was confirmed at a hospital on Thursday after she was found lying in her cell at the Osaka detention center, a justice ministry official told AFP.",
      "The cause of death has yet to be determined, he said. Japanese media said it could be from an undisclosed illness.",

      "She had relationships primarily with elderly or ill men and met some through dating agencies, where she reportedly stipulated that prospective partners should be wealthy and childless.",

    "story": [
      "India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92.",
      "Singh was admitted to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a \"sudden loss of consciousness at home,\" the hospital said in a statement.",
      "\"Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\" at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \"despite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 p.m.\"",
      "Singh was being treated for \"age-related medical conditions,\" the statement said.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India's longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament's Upper House, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party's crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India's \"most distinguished leaders\" who rose from humble origins and left \"a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\"",
      "\"As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people's lives,\" Modi said in a post on the social platform X. He called Singh's interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker \"insightful\" and said \"his wisdom and humility were always visible.\"",
      "Rahul Gandhi, from the same party as Singh and the opposition leader in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said Singh's \"deep understanding of economics inspired the nation\" and that he \"led India with immense wisdom and integrity.\"",
      "\"I have lost a mentor and guide. Millions of us who admired him will remember him with the utmost pride,\" Gandhi wrote on X.",

      "\"We mourn Dr. Singh's passing and will always remember his dedication to bringing the United States and India closer together,\" Blinken said.",
      "Born on Sept. 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India, Singh's brilliant academic career took him to Cambridge University in Britain, where he earned a degree in economics in 1957. He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as economic advisor in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India's second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India's Upper House of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country's top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country's various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India's nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with Communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",
      "He also tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet, which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "His 1965 book, \"India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth,\" dealt with India's inward-oriented trade policy.",

      "Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left 29 survivors injured, as speculation mounted about the cause of the disaster \u2014 including whether possible Russian air defense operations may have played a role.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted, for reasons that are still unclear, and crashed while trying to land in Aktau, in western Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 2 miles from Aktau.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News there are early indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the plane. The official, who asked not to be publicly identified, said that if these indications prove true, it would further underscore Russian recklessness in its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage and photos showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rear half of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash but said the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.",
      "\"The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,\" he said.",

Mangystau Regional Transport Prosecutor Abylaibek Ordabayev said they have not yet come to any conclusions about whether that was the case, Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Russian anti-aircraft systems eyed in investigation",
      "As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some analysts alleging that holes seen in the plane's tail section possibly indicate it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems, like those used for fending off Ukrainian drone attacks.",
      "Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. Some Russian media claimed there was another drone attack on Chechnya Wednesday, though it wasn't officially confirmed.",
      "Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal the damage compatible with shrapnel from a small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system.",
      "\"It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,\" he said.",
      "Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the \"Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.\" Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war in Ukraine.",
      "Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war.",
      "\"This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,\" Nicholson wrote online. \"It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.\"",
      "Russian military expert Yury Podolyaka was cited by Agence France-Presse as saying holes seen in the plane's wreckage were similar to those an \"anti-aircraft missile system\" would leave. \"Everything points to that,\" he wrote.",
      "And Gerard Legauffre, a former expert at France's BEA air accident investigation agency, also said there appeared to be \"a lot of shrapnel\" damage to the wreckage, according to AFP.",
      "He depicted it as \"reminiscent\" of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a passenger jet that was downed with a surface-to-air missile by Russia-backed rebels over eastern Ukraine in 2014.",
      "But when asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, \"It would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.\"",

      "The Israeli Justice Ministry made the announcement in a terse message late Thursday, saying the investigation would focus on the findings of a recent report by the \"Uvda\" investigative program into Sara Netanyahu.",

      "The announcement did not mention Mrs. Netanyahu by name, and the Justice Ministry declined further comment.",

Netanyahu denies the charges and says he is the victim of a \"witch hunt\" by overzealous prosecutors, police and the media.",

She also told Bleiweiss to get activists in Netanyahu's Likud party to publish attacks on Klein.",

      "Sara Netanyahu has been accused of abusive behavior toward her personal staff before. This, together with accusations of excessive spending and using public money for her own extravagant personal tastes, has earned her an image as being out of touch with everyday Israelis.

      "\"We've enjoyed America. We love being here,\" he told CBS News. \"But there are lots of things about Britain that we miss. Boxing Day is probably in that top 10.\"",
      "What is Boxing Day?",
      "Boxing Day is celebrated on Dec. 26 by the United Kingdom, its commonwealth countries and some former colonies.",
      "Stores run shopping deals, similar to Black Friday, and fans cheer on sporting events such as soccer, cricket, rugby, horse racing and hunting.",
      "McLean said that hosting a Boxing Day party is also a great way to finish off some of the Christmas food. Turkey is a traditional British Christmas meal and on Boxing Day, many enjoy a turkey curry. Another classic Boxing Day dish is bubble and squeak, or fried leftover potato and greens like cabbage or Brussels sprouts.",
      "Why is it called Boxing Day and what are its origins?",
      "There are two major theories for where the holiday began.",
      "Some believe that Boxing Day began with churches collecting alms boxes of parishioners' donated money, according to Britannica. The church would give these boxes of donations to the poor the day after Christmas.",
      "The name has stuck, but now, people typically donate to charity in the weeks leading up to the holidays.",
      "Others believe that the day was observed because servants had to work at Christmas dinners and festivities, so they celebrated the holiday on Dec. 26. According to History.com, the lords and aristocrats would give their servants \"Christmas boxes\" filled with leftovers and small gifts after the parties, leading to the name \"Boxing Day.\"",
      "Employers still give service workers bonuses around the holidays, just as leftovers still are a part of celebrations today.",
      "A third theory, according to TimeOut, is that British naval ships would seal a box of money at the start of a long voyage, and at the end, priests would open the boxes and donate the money to those in need.",
      "McLean said other theories about the name include bare-knuckle boxing matches that occurred the day after Christmas, or that many people return their boxes of unwanted gifts that day.",
      "Is Boxing Day an official holiday?",
      "Yes, Boxing Day is a public or bank holiday recognized in the U.K. and other countries. It was made an official U.K. holiday in the 1800s. If Dec. 26 falls on a weekend, it is recognized on the following Monday. In 2024, it falls on a Thursday and in 2025, it will fall on a Friday.",
      "Where is it celebrated?",
      "Countries that are a part of the British Commonwealth like Australia, Canada and New Zealand celebrate but some former colonies like South Africa and Hong Kong also recognize the holiday.",
      "However, people can celebrate anywhere, as demonstrated by the McLeans' party. Even though some of their American friends work on the 26th, people gather at their house in the evening for a spirited pub quiz, yummy leftovers and mulled wine.",
      "Is Boxing Day the same as St. Stephen's Day?",
      "Not necessarily, because St. Stephen's Day is a religious holiday, but the two are linked and are recognized on the same day. Christians observe St. Stephen's Day in celebration of the first Christian martyr who was known for helping the poor and for his charitable work. St. Stephen's Day is more widely recognized in Ireland and other European countries.",
      "Why don't Americans recognize Boxing Day?",
      "The U.S. is one of the few English-speaking countries that does not recognize Boxing Day. Americans don't celebrate mainly because the country is not part of the British Commonwealth and the holiday did not become officially recognized until 1871, almost a century after the U.S. gained independence.",
      "What sporting events are happening on Boxing Day this year?",

      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",
      "Mulino said that while there are \"delicate problems such as immigration\" that both he and Trump \"are concerned about as presidents,\" the two leaders have \"nothing to discuss\" as far as ownership of the Panama Canal.",
      "\"The specific approach, the Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians, there is no possibility of opening any kind of conversation about this reality that has cost the country tears, sweat and blood to achieve,\" Mulino said.",

      "The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Waves towering up to 100 feet high swept away nearly everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 in their path.",

      "Indonesia, which is located along the fault lines that make up the\u00a0Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. It suffered another disaster in 2018 when huge waves were triggered by an earthquake in Sulawesi, killing thousands.",
      "In the years since 2004, infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety.",
      "The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed.",
      "In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country.",

Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived.",
      "Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day.",

      "\"It can be any psychiatric symptom that increases in frequency or intensity as the sun goes down or at night,\" Guastello told Fox News Digital.",
      "Symptoms may include feelings of depression, isolation and hopelessness that tend to increase at night, the expert said.",
      "While \"sunset anxiety\" isn\u2019t an official medical diagnosis and does not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), some\u00a0mental health experts agree that it\u2019s a very real phenomenon. (iStock)",
      "What is sunset anxiety, exactly?",
      "Sunset anxiety occurs when a person starts to feel anxious as the sun goes down at the end of the day, Beena Persaud, PsyD, clinical psychologist with Cleveland Clinic Akron General in Akron, Ohio, told Fox News Digital.",

      "People who have previously experienced episodes of anxiety and are generally more on the anxious side are more susceptible, Persaud said, as are people who have a heightened sensitivity to light changes and those who consider themselves to be \"night owls.\"",
      "\"Adults are more likely to feel it than teens or children, and this may be due to adults' sense of responsibility for daily activities,\" one expert said. (iStock)",
      "There are no specific gender or racial tendencies for sunset anxiety, the expert noted.",
      "\"Adults are more likely to feel it than teens or children, and this may be due to adults' sense of responsibility for daily activities,\" she added.",
      "Common triggers",
      "The onset of sunset anxiety could be related to the circadian rhythm, which is the body\u2019s internal clock that regulates many functions, according to experts. The circadian rhythm is influenced by the production of melatonin, Persaud said.",
      "\"We know there can be hormonal changes with winter and daylight saving time,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Since our production of melatonin is easily affected by light, early darkness can cause symptoms of both anxiety and depression. The body believes it should be getting ready for bed because of the darkness.\"",
      "\"The lack of natural light can cause people to have less energy and motivation, restless discomfort, worry and nervousness about accomplishing tasks.\"",
      "Experts report an increase in seasonal anxiety from October to late March.",
      "\"The changing of the seasons and earlier darkness make it a prime time for people to experience both sunset anxiety and seasonal depression,\" Persaud said.",

      "Anxiety can also occur if someone is carrying a heavy mental load of activities and responsibilities and struggling to complete them all by the evening.",
      "\"Darkness occurring earlier makes us physically and emotionally tired, and we feel as if the day is ending before we can achieve our daily goals,\" said Persaud.",
      "Tips to alleviate sunset anxiety",
      "Guastello at the University of Florida offered the following tips to help curb anxiety around sunset.",

      "Krish Patel, M.D., is director of lymphoma research at Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee. (Sarah Cannon Research Institute\u00a0)",
      "A: In the field of lymphomas, we see growing momentum for therapies that use the patient's own immune system to fight their cancer, such as CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies.",
      "These are treatments that are now being studied and are making an impact earlier in the disease course, including one now being studied as the very first treatment a patient might receive for their lymphoma.",
      "PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENT SURVIVAL DOUBLED WITH HIGH DOSE OF COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY FINDS",
      "These treatments are helping us to be less dependent on chemotherapies (which may be effective but have broad side effects) for the treatment of lymphomas.",
      "A: Every year we are improving the curative treatment options we have for specific types of lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is the most common lymphoma we see.",
      "We are also gradually becoming better able to offer these treatments closer to \u2013 or in \u2013 patients\u2019 homes and communities, so they can receive the best care as close to home as possible.",
      "\"Every year, we are improving the curative treatment options we have for specific types of lymphomas.\"",
      "I believe that in 2025, we will continue to see more advancement in immunotherapies, development of more targeted therapies (including oral medicines), and hopefully soon the approval of next generations of immunotherapies that may work for patients who have already received today's immunotherapies but need more treatment options.",
      "A: It has changed and evolved dramatically. A decade ago, care for lymphomas was primarily chemotherapy-based. Now, we are shifting rapidly away from chemotherapies in some types of lymphomas in favor of immunotherapies and targeted oral therapies that lead to excellent long-term outcomes for patients, with fewer side effects than historical treatments.",
      "As 2024 comes to an end, experts are looking back and reflecting on the discoveries and advances that have been made in the field of cancer treatment and prevention. (iStock)",
      "A: We think of lymphomas as diseases of aging for most patients. Some patients may have select risk factors, such as being on specific immunosuppressants or having exposure to very specific industrial chemicals.",

      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO USE VPNS WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPS",
      "6 ways to bypass VPN blockers",
      "If you're having trouble accessing certain sites with your VPN on, try the steps below. Start from the first step and keep going until the issue is resolved.",
      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",
      "If all else fails, switch to a mobile data connection or a different network. Sometimes, the issue is with your current ISP (internet service provider) rather than the VPN.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "VPNs are great for getting around restrictions, but some websites have blockers to stop VPN traffic. There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service. They keep an eye on their servers to make sure everything\u2019s running smoothly and offer extra features like dedicated IP addresses.",

Inspired by the challenge of replicating human-like precision in physical tasks, the team embarked on a journey to build a basketball-playing robot.

According to a July 2024 warning from the\u00a0FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, these scams are part of the cartel's efforts to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including drug trafficking.",
      "Since at least 2012, the cartel and other Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations have increasingly targeted U.S. owners of timeshare properties in Mexico, particularly older adults who are often more vulnerable to such scams. The proceeds from these fraudulent activities not only support the cartel's operations but also contribute to the manufacturing and trafficking of dangerous substances like fentanyl into the United States.",
      "8 PHISHING SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON",
      "How these scams work",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has expanded its criminal activities beyond traditional drug trafficking into sophisticated scams, including timeshare fraud targeting unsuspecting individuals, particularly Americans. Here are some of the methods employed by the cartel in executing these scams:",
      "Impersonation of legitimate entities: Scammers often pose as legitimate real estate agents, escrow companies or even officials from U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department. This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",
      "Targeting vulnerable populations: The cartel primarily targets elderly Americans who own timeshares in Mexico. These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "Protecting yourself from timeshare scams",
      "To avoid falling victim to similar scams, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard your financial interests:",
      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "These days, it\u2019s not just your laptop and phone connected to the network, but also things like security cameras, thermostats and even air conditioners are all managed by your router. But be honest, when was the last time you did anything to secure your router? It\u2019s easy to forget about it, especially if it\u2019s working fine. The thing is, a lot of people feel the same way, and a study reveals this \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude could be putting millions at serious risk.",

      "Shocking router security facts you need to know",
      "The\u00a02024 Broadband Genie router security survey has uncovered some startling facts about how internet users approach router security. Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "Alarmingly, 75% of users have never checked to see who is connected to their network. With an average home now hosting around 12 connected devices, failing to monitor network activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Even more worrying, three-quarters of respondents do not understand why adjusting router settings is important, showing a significant gap in awareness about the risks associated with default configurations.",
      "\"In 2022, we ran a similar study and found 48% had never touched their router's factory settings. It\u2019s concerning that not only has the number come down after two years, it\u2019s got worse,\" said Alex Tofts, strategist at Broadband Genie.",
      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "5) Enable network encryption: Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "6) Regularly reboot your router: Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software: To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software.

      "Cybercriminals are constantly evolving the ways they target us, which means securing just your phone or laptop isn\u2019t enough anymore. You need to be cautious with anything connected to the internet, whether it's your router, smart cameras or doorbell. However, the Broadband Genie survey reveals that only a small number of people are aware of the best cybersecurity practices when it comes to protecting their routers.

ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",

Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",

      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats.

Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud.

      "Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was indicted on one count of murder in the first degree, three counts of murder in the second degree and one count of arson after a woman was lit on fire and burned to death on a subway train in Brooklyn, New York. The indictment was filed Thursday and will be unsealed at an arraignment hearing on Jan. 7.",
      "Zapeta's attorney told the judge he spoke with his client Friday and asked for permission to waive his client's appearance. The judge granted the request.",
      "Zapeta is a previously deported immigrant from Guatemala who first entered the country in June 2018. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News that it has lodged an immigration detainer with the New York City Department of Corrections for Zapeta, but the corrections department has indicated it will not honor the detainer, per its current policy.

      "Gonzalez said at a Friday press briefing that he believes the case should be tried in state court. His remarks come after New York City Mayor Adams' office tells Fox News that the mayor believes Zapeta should face federal criminal charges.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that this case belongs in state court because the charges here are more significant in state court than currently in federal court,\" Gonzalez said. \"But we have a very strong working relationship with our federal partners and we always do what's in the best interests of the people in the state of New York and in the city of Brooklyn (sic) because we want to make sure that he is held fully accountable.\"",

      "\"This was malicious. A sleeping, vulnerable woman on our subway system,\" Gonzalez added. \"This act surprised many New Yorkers as they were getting ready to celebrate the holidays but now New Yorkers are waking up and understanding that on the 22nd of this year, this happened. This was intentional and we hope to prove this.\"",

      "Han\u2019s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country\u2019s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image.",

Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president\u2019s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",

      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment. That\u2019s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Yoon\u2019s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn\u2019t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",

The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered.",
      "Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels.",

      "For decades, firearm ownership in Israel was uncommon. Although military service ensured that many Israelis were trained with weapons, personal firearms were seen as more of a liability than a necessity. The strict licensing process deterred many, and Israelis trusted the state and its defense forces to protect them from terror threats, which took precedence over Israel\u2019s low crime rates.",

      "Saar Zohar, a reservist in an elite unit, expressed a similar shift. For years, Zohar resisted owning a gun, believing it unnecessary after his service. But a series of terror attacks following Oct. 7 pushed him to reconsider. \"I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being helpless if something happened,\" he says. \"Knowing I have the training and can respond, I feel it is my responsibility.\"",

      "Unlike in the United States, where gun ownership is often linked to fears of crime or the defense of private property, firearms in Israel are seen as tools for countering terrorism. Historically, Israel has avoided the public mass shootings that have sometimes plagued the U.S., but experts warn that the rapid proliferation of firearms could change this. With so many untrained individuals carrying weapons, the fear of impulsive actions and tragic mistakes looms large.",
      "Zohar is haunted by the potential for misidentification. \"The idea that another armed civilian might mistake me for an attacker terrifies me,\" he says, referencing a tragic incident in November 2023 when an Israeli civilian who had shot at terrorists in Jerusalem was mistakenly killed by a young soldier.",
      "The psychological toll of this shift is evident among those newly armed.

      "But Haskel is also disturbed by what he has seen at shooting ranges. \"People treat it like a game, firing without any understanding of the responsibility. It\u2019s horrifying to think these people are now licensed.\"",
      "For many Israelis, the reform represents a necessary response to an existential threat. Yet, it has also exposed deep flaws in the system. Critics argue that the current approach sacrifices long-term safety for short-term security, warning of potential unintended consequences, from accidental shootings to a rise in domestic violence.",

      "Froman sees things differently. \"If someone threatens you, you only draw your weapon in a national security situation. You don\u2019t pull a gun for personal life-threatening situations unless it\u2019s a case of terrorists. The rules here are clear \u2013 you must have a safe for your weapon. I can\u2019t rely on my husband\u2019s safe; a firearm is personal. I\u2019m not allowed to use his gun, and he\u2019s not allowed to use mine. The regulations are very strict. The weapon is for defending against those who want to harm us, not for general self-defense.\"",

Brooks Spector told Fox News Digital.",
      "Spector, a former U.S. diplomat now based in Johannesburg, and associate editor of the respected Daily Maverick, added that \"continuing action and rhetoric by South Africa in its pursuit of Israel in international court efforts will, however, encourage Republicans in Congress (and probably in the administration as well) to strip South Africa of benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, assuming the act is renewed next year.\"",

      "South Africa\u2019s moves are very definitely in an extremely bright spotlight in Washington. From inside the beltway, Richard Goldberg told Fox News Digital he\u2019s worried particularly over potential links between South Africa and Iran. Goldberg is a former member of the National Security Council, and a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He told Fox News Digital, \"The first step is to build the case publicly, and give South Africa one last moment of choosing. We should declassify intelligence about South Africa\u2019s deep relationship with Iran, and any other support or partnership with terrorist groups.\"",
      "Goldberg continued, \"And then we need to use our full diplomatic and economic weight to force Pretoria to choose between the United States and our terrorist adversaries. AGOA should be one of several items on the policy menu.\"",
      "South Africa\u2019s Department of International Relations didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment, but COSATU\u2019s Parliamentary Coordinator, Matthew Parks, did. COSATU is the Confederation of South African Trade Unions, historically aligned with President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC party. Parks is highly respected for his meaningful and dignified pursuance of workers\u2019 rights. His members have much to lose, including potentially their jobs, if South Africa is pushed out of AGOA. But he appeared to be cautiously optimistic when talking to Fox News Digital. \"We are confident that our relations with the U.S. will continue to grow, including through AGOA, simply because it is to the benefit of both our peoples,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and former President Trump appear during a Fox News Channel town hall in Greenville, South Carolina, on Feb. 20. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)",
      "\"We\u2019ve been extensively involved in engagements between South Africa and the U.S., on how to deepen our relations and toward the renewal of AGOA,\" Parks continued. \"We\u2019ve engaged extensively with our colleagues in the U.S. labor movement, business community, Congress (both Republicans and Democrats), the State Department, Department of Labor, NSC and the White House.\"",
      "As Trump moves into the White House, nearby Ebrahim Rassool will be starting his second term as South African ambassador to the U.S. This month he talked to the Daily Maverick\u00a0on South Africa\u2019s challenges with the new administration, referring to South Africa\u2019s attack on Israel at the ICJ.\u00a0\"We will stick by the case, but let us now trust our legal team,\" he said, \"trust the evidence that we have placed in front of the judges of the ICJ, trust the judges of the ICJ to come to a sustainable, just solution \u2014 but that we need to put away the megaphone now.\"",

      "Rassool pointed out that the South African oranges exported to the U.S. under AGOA enabled Americans to drink orange juice all year round, when Florida and California oranges were out of season.",
      "Rassool added, \"Why would you want to punish America with expensive cars when the BMWs coming from South Africa are going to be much cheaper than getting them from Germany or manufacturing your own?",
      "\"Likewise, to point out that American cancer patients are receiving medical nuclear isotopes that come from South Africa.\"",
      "The expulsion of South Africa from AGOA would be \"disastrous,\" Renai Moothilal, CEO of the National Association of Automotive Component & Allied Manufacturers, wrote last year in the Business Day newspaper. \"It will be no surprise if some component manufacturers close their doors. U.S.-headquartered multinational manufacturers with plants here may exit the South African country if there are volume losses linked to our exclusion from AGOA, or other forms of political pressure are brought to bear.\"",
      "Observers note there are loud threats coming from President-elect Trump himself, including a claim that he will slap a 100% import tariff on countries like South Africa if, as members of BRICS, they adopt a new currency to rival the dollar. In the other corner of the ring, South African politicians are taking a more placatory and reserved tone. The Democratic Alliance or DA is South Africa\u2019s main opposition party. But since May, they have also been members of the government of national unity, working in a sometimes noisy coalition with President Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC.",

      "Emma Powell, the DA\u2019s national spokesperson for foreign affairs, told Fox News Digital that it\u2019s likely the relationship between Pretoria and Washington \"will become increasingly transactional, with greater emphasis placed on equitable reciprocity. This would contrast the Biden administration\u2019s approach to beneficiation-based investment and development. There is also likely to be less tolerance for any action on the part of the South African government that may be perceived as undermining the national security interests of the United States.\"",
      "Powell added that \"the Trump administration is also likely to take a more cautious approach on AGOA eligibility.\"",
      "Spector told Fox News Digital he could take home one strong positive: \"The incoming U.S. president\u2019s often-expressed support for transactional foreign economic policies may possibly be an incentive for Africa's nations \u2014 urged on by South Africa \u2013 to come together with initiatives offering trade and market concessions in Africa to America.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "A handful of down-ballot elections at the outset of the new year will serve as the first tests of the political environment following Trump's November victory.",
    "story": [
      "A handful of downballot elections at the outset of the new year will serve as the first tests of the political environment following Donald Trump and the Republicans\u2019 victories in November.",
      "In the opening months of 2025, there will be special legislative elections in Virginia, a race in battleground Wisconsin that will yet again determine the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court, and special elections for Trump\u2019s current (and former) Cabinet picks.",
      "While these contests are not as flashy as the presidential politics that have consumed Americans for the better part of the last two years, they will nevertheless attract plenty of cash and attention during an off-year in which the GOP looks to build on its momentum and the Democratic Party seeks to regain its footing.",
      "Here are the key state and local races to watch during the early part of 2025.",
      "Virginia legislative special elections",
      "A pair of special elections in Virginia\u2019s Loudoun County on Jan. 7 that will determine control of the state legislature will bring voters back to the polls just weeks after the presidential election.",
      "Voters will select a new lawmaker to fill a seat vacated by state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who was elected to Congress in the November elections. They will also fill a vacant state House seat left open by a candidate who resigned to run for Subramanyam\u2019s seat.",
      "In the state Senate race, Democratic Del. Kannan Srinivasan is up against Republican Tumay Harding. In the state House race, Democrat JJ Singh will face off against Republican Ram Venkatachalam.",
      "Democrats are favored to win both races, as the district areas went firmly for Kamala Harris in the presidential election, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. But the margins in the races, expected to be low turnout affairs, could offer a sense of which way the political winds are blowing in a state in which Republicans have managed to gain back ground recently.",
      "Republican Glenn Youngkin won Virginia\u2019s 2021 gubernatorial race just a year after Joe Biden carried the state by 10 points in 2020. Virginia will hold another closely watched race to succeed Youngkin in November 2025 following a presidential election in which Trump cut Democrats\u2019 advantage to less than 6 points.",
      "\u201cVirginia is kind of the first out of the gate with elections after the big national election,\u201d said National Conference of State Legislatures CEO Tim Storey.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a pattern of Virginia running counter to the previous national cycle,\u201d he added, \u201cso, if you\u2019re Virginia Democrats \u2026 it probably gives you a little stronger hand going into the election.\u201d",
      "The two contests will also determine the partisan balance of each legislative chamber.",
      "Following Subramanyam\u2019s resignation, Democrats hold a 20-19 majority in Virginia\u2019s state Senate. If Democrats lose the special election, control of the chamber would go to the Republicans, because GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears holds tie-breaking authority.",
      "In the House of Delegates, Democrats currently hold a 51-49 advantage because Srinivasan\u2019s resignation doesn\u2019t take effect until Jan. 7. A win by the Republicans would result in a 50-50 tie. A tie vote in the chamber results in a defeat. In similar situations in the past, both parties have entered into a power-sharing agreement in the state House.",
      "Republicans winning control of either or both chambers could be particularly meaningful for Youngkin in the final year of his term as he potentially lays the groundwork for a bid for higher office.",
      "Wisconsin Supreme Court race",
      "Less than two years ago, liberals won control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years.",
      "In April, ideological control of the pivotal swing state\u2019s bench is once again at stake.",
      "As was the case in 2023, the April 1 election to replace 73-year-old liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is likely to be an expensive and bitter race. And it promises to feature many of the same hot-button issues \u2014 such as abortion rights and redistricting \u2014 that defined the race two years earlier.",
      "Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge, is running as the liberal in the race, while Brad Schimel, a former Republican state attorney general who serves as a Waukesha County judge, is running as the conservative. The court is technically nonpartisan, but candidates can take public stances on political issues and can receive backing from the state\u2019s political parties during their campaigns.",
      "That was the case in 2023, when liberal Janet Protasiewicz centered her successful campaign on support for abortion rights and opposition to the state\u2019s gerrymandered maps, two issues that were due to come before the court after she was sworn in.",
      "Republicans say they\u2019re poised to make the race about the entire court and the power that comes with it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just one seat on the court. It\u2019s a control of the court for three or four years,\u201d Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said. Referring to a recent decision by a state judge to overturn a landmark anti-union law enacted by then-Gov. Scott Walker in 2011, he added that \u201creforms are on the chopping block, going back for decades.\u201d That case is all but certain to end up before the state Supreme Court next year and is likely to feature prominently in the race.",
      "There are not multiple candidates running on either side, allowing both Crawford and Schimel to train their sights on each other immediately ahead of the general election. (In 2023, multiple candidates ran on both sides, which resulted in a fractured conservative base).",
      "Another key difference from the last Supreme Court race is Republicans are far more emboldened this time around after Trump\u2019s victory in Wisconsin over Harris. In 2023, Democrats were coming off a string of statewide successes in the years since Trump\u2019s win in the state in 2016.",
      "Democrats have nevertheless signaled their intention to try to attach Schimel to a broader Trump-centered GOP brand in hopes that progressives will feel energized in the off-year election.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different electorate compared to a presidential year,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesperson Joe Oslund said, adding that a potentially low-turnout race would mean \u201cwe go after the Trump thing.\u201d",
      "Schimming, asked whether he felt Democrats could make Trump a vulnerability for Schimel, dismissed the notion.",
      "\u201cFrankly, they just got done making that mistake,\u201d he said.",
      "Special House elections",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of special elections in safe Republican seats in the U.S. House will also occur next year to replace members of Congress whom Trump tapped for his Cabinet.",
      "Those include the seats currently held by Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s pick to be his national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stafanik, R-N.Y., Trump\u2019s pick to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "There will also be a special election for the seat held by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. R-Fla., who resigned after Trump selected him to be attorney general. Gaetz eventually withdrew from consideration amid sexual misconduct allegations, which he denied.",
      "Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd announced that the special primary elections for both Waltz\u2019s and Gaetz\u2019s seats will be held Jan. 28 and that the special general elections for both seats will be held April 1.",
      "Waltz is slated to resign from the House on Jan. 20, after Trump formally takes office. His nomination doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation.",
      "Stefanik, whose position does require Senate confirmation, hasn\u2019t disclosed the timing of her resignation. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul must set the date for the special election within 90 days of her departure under state law.",
      "While all three districts are solidly Republican, the margins could provide a sense of how voters are feeling about the early weeks of Trump\u2019s second term."

      "The exact number of North Korean soldiers who killed themselves to avoid capture is unclear. Zelenskyy said Friday that while \u201cseveral\u201d North Korean soldiers were captured, they were \u201cseriously wounded and could not be resuscitated,\u201d suggesting that some of them may have also been killed by comrades.",
      "These troops were being sent to fight with \u201cminimal protection,\u201d he said, and were suffering a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of losses.",
      "Still, Ukrainians have been unable to capture them as prisoners, he added. \u201cTheir own people are executing them.\u201d"

      "When no one wins the jackpot, it rolls over, and ticket sales contribute to the growth of the top prize.",
      "If the person who bought the ticket lives in California, they could take home the maximum amount. The state is one of eight in which state governments don\u2019t tax lottery winnings.",
      "The win Friday night is the fifth-largest in the history of the game. What had been the fifth-biggest, a jackpot of $1.128 billion, was claimed Monday, months after the March 26 drawing.",
      "That winning ticket was purchased at a ShopRite in Neptune Township, New Jersey, Mega Millions officials said. New Jersey winners have a year to make such a claim.",
      "\u201cIt is common for large jackpot winners to take their time to file a claim,\u201d Mega Millions officials said in the statement.",
      "The winner, who chose protection under New Jersey law to remain anonymous, opted for the prize's cash value, estimated at $537.5 million before state and federal taxes, Mega Millions officials said.",
      "The federal tax on such an amount is likely to be 37%; New Jersey would tax it at 8%.",
      "The Mega Millions jackpot found a winner three times in 2024 so far. It's a number officials said would amount to the fewest jackpot wins in a year since the seven-state Big Game became Mega Millions in 2002.",
      "Mega Millions, played in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, produced 10 jackpots in 2023, the most since the game underwent major changes in 2013, officials said in a statement on Monday.",
      "A player from Florida claimed the largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.602 billion, in August 2023.\u00a0As large as that amount is, however, it could not surpass fellow multi-state lottery game Powerball's most valuable jackpot, $2.040 billion, recorded in November 2022."

    "summary": "The claims came after Elon Musk was involved in a public feud with some Republicans over immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk faced accusations of censorship Friday from fellow conservatives after several prominent right-wing accounts who had criticized Musk\u2019s views on immigration said that they subsequently lost access to premium features on Musk\u2019s social media app, X.",
      "At least 14 conservative accounts said late Thursday or Friday that X had revoked their blue verification badge, cutting them off from a variety of premium features, including the ability to monetize their accounts through subscriptions and advertising revenue-sharing, according to a review conducted by NBC News. Some accounts said the number of those affected was far higher.",
      "The accounts were all still active Friday, but without access to monetization features; some of them said they worried about their ability to keep posting.",
      "Some conservatives said they considered X\u2019s actions to be a betrayal by Musk, who purchased the service then known as Twitter in 2022 in part because he said it had unfairly limited conservative speech. Musk has since called himself a free-expression advocate, even as he calls for jailing some of his critics.",
      "Musk and X did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. But on Thursday night, about an hour before some conservatives started complaining about losing access to X\u2019s premium features, Musk posted what he called \u201ca reminder\u201d on X. He wrote that the site\u2019s algorithm automatically reduces the reach of a user if they\u2019re frequently blocked or muted by other, credible users.",
      "\u201cIf far more credible, verified subscriber accounts (not bots) mute/block your account compared to those who like your posts, your reach will decline significantly,\u201d Musk posted.",
      "But rather than satisfying people complaining about censorship, the post elicited even more accusations that Musk was shadowbanning his conservative critics, or reducing engagement on their posts without officially disclosing such actions to affected accounts.",
      "The actions by X came in the middle of a heated online debate on the subject of future immigration policy under President-elect Donald Trump, with anti-immigration MAGA loyalists denouncing the influence of pro-immigration tech executives and investors such as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.",
      "Many of the affected accounts said they were affiliated with one media brand in particular, ConservativeOG.",
      "Preston Parra, a 23-year-old influencer and head of ConservativeOG, said he considered the actions by X to be a \u201cpolitical takedown\u201d in retaliation for publicly disagreeing with Musk\u2019s pro-immigration views.",
      "He said he plans to keep fighting Musk, not only to get his premium features restored but also to ensure that Trump pursues restrictionist immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIf anyone thinks for one minute the REAL backbone of the right wing and MAGA is gonna stand idly by while these big tech gillionaire Silicon Valley dweebs who didn\u2019t get bullied enough in high school, steal our country, they\u2019re mistaken,\u201d Parra said in a text message. He said he believes Musk to be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d in the Trump camp.",
      "Trump announced that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d to much fanfare, shortly after the Nov. 5 election. But in recent days, after venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan was announced as a White House adviser on AI policy, Trump\u2019s tech-world allies \u2014 including Musk and Ramaswamy \u2014 have come under deeper scrutiny and criticism from the far-right for their previous statements about or involvement with legal immigration.",
      "Musk is an immigrant, having been born and raised in South Africa. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002.",
      "At least three of the affected X accounts have more than 1 million followers each, including the accounts of Ryan Fournier and Laura Loomer.",
      "Fournier, a co-founder of Students for Trump, said he had had a blue verified badge on the social media app since 2016. He wrote on X that he had \u201cno clue why\u201d he lost it this week. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Premium subscriptions on X include several benefits such as increased prominence in the replies to other accounts\u2019 posts and the ability to apply for sharing ad revenue.",
      "Loomer, a far-right activist and close Trump ally, said that X had demonetized her \u2014 cutting off her ability to collect subscription fees and other revenue on the site \u2014 and had revoked her blue verification checkmark about two days after she began criticizing Musk over tech industry visas.",
      "On Tuesday, Loomer wrote on X that tech billionaires \u201care like termites who have descended upon Palm Beach,\u201d where Trump is working on the presidential transition from his Mar-a-Lago resort. And she kept up her criticism as the week went on.",
      "Musk mentioned her in a post Thursday, writing: \u201cLoomer is trolling for attention. Ignore.\u201d",
      "And hours later, Loomer says her account lost access to premium features.",
      "\u201cLooks like Elon Musk is going to be silencing me for supporting original Trump immigration policies,\u201d she posted on X, calling the changes to her account \u201cretaliation.\u201d She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Andrew Torba, the CEO of the far-right social media app Gab, has in the past praised Musk, but on Friday he criticized the billionaire for silencing others and invited disaffected X users to come to his platform instead. Torba is openly antisemitic and on Friday also posted that people have \u201ctwo choices: be racist or be replaced.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the first time that X and Musk have been accused of silencing users, despite Musk\u2019s vowed commitments to free speech. In September, X said it temporarily suspended a journalist for posting private personal information, after he shared a document that appeared to have been stolen from Trump\u2019s campaign. In 2022, the platform suspended the accounts of several other journalists who wrote about Musk.",
      "In July, X suspended the account \u201cWhite Dudes for Harris,\u201d which supported Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump, and in August it temporarily shut down \u201cProgressives for Harris.\u201d"

      "The law at the heart of the suit is the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a bipartisan measure passed by Congress and subsequently signed into law by President Joe Biden in April.",

      "Earlier this month, the court decided to hear the case and fast-tracked the schedule for briefing and oral arguments. However, the court punted on TikTok\u2019s request to pause implementation of the ban, leaving just nine days after oral arguments for it to issue an opinion or indefinitely block the law.",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts, suggested in Friday\u2019s court filing that he could negotiate a political resolution to the matter before the court needs to rule.",

      "Trump previously met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in December, hours after the president-elect expressed he had a \u201cwarm spot\u201d for the app, a reversal from his opposition to it four years ago.",
      "The Justice Department and TikTok also submitted briefs in the case on Friday, mainly rehashing arguments they made before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "That court upheld the law, concluding that the government\u2019s national security justifications for banning the app, including concerns that the Chinese government could access data about American users and manipulate content on the app, were legitimate.",
      "Chinese government officials have consistently rejected the argument that TikTok is a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "In its court filing Friday, the Justice Department defended the law, citing national security concerns that the Chinese government could influence the company.",
      "TikTok, meanwhile, opposed the law, saying in its brief that banning the app would violate free speech rights protected under the First Amendment."

      "\"Greg approached his illness like one would expect he would, with stoicism, grace and positivity,\" the statement says. \"He leaves behind \"a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry.\"",
      "Gumbel, the older brother of former \u201cTODAY\u201d co-host Bryant Gumbel, began working at CBS Sports in 1989. He left in 1994 to work at NBC Sports before returning to CBS in 1998.",

Combs, 55, who has denied those allegations, has pleaded not guilty and is being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York.",
      "For decades, Combs presented the image of a wealthy Black music mogul, one who broke business barriers, threw lavish parties and even created iconic TV moments. But behind the scenes, prosecutors say, was a more sinister picture. Most recently, three men accused Combs of rape and sexual assault in separate lawsuits, alleging the rap star plied them with doctored drinks and then attacked them while they were unconscious. In response, Combs\u2019 legal team said the complaints were \u201cfull of lies\u201d and vowed to \u201cprove them false and seek sanctions against every unethical lawyer who filed fictional claims against him.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, was accused in a lawsuit of raping a teenage girl with Combs after an awards show more than two decades ago. The rapper and entrepreneur vehemently denied the allegations, calling them \u201cidiotic\u201d in a statement. Carter\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, has said Carter\u2019s legal team expects him to be cleared of any wrongdoing. The accuser in that case acknowledged inconsistencies in her account.",

      "Williams potentially faced decades in prison for participating in a street gang, Young Slime Life, or YSL, that allegedly carried out murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and drug dealing. Williams ultimately pleaded guilty to drug- and gun-related charges and no contest to charges of conspiracy and participating in the gang.",
      "Instead of prison time, the judge ordered Williams to serve 15 years of probation with several conditions \u2014 but warned that he could see 20 years in custody if he fails to adhere to them. The plea change and sentence marked a pivotal moment in Georgia\u2019s longest-running criminal trial.",
      "Williams\u2019 fans rejoiced that the lengthy trial had come to an end with his freedom, however conditional. Williams was arrested in 2022 and the trial got underway in 2023.",

She gave an in-depth look at the grief she endured after her mother\u2019s death from a brain tumor in 2019, the betrayal by her childhood friend Kelsey Harris \u2014 who supported Lanez after the shooting \u2014 and her fight for justice as Lanez, along with bloggers and gossip sites, disparaged her on social media, in music videos and more.",
      "Social media reactions to the 112-minute film ranged from sympathy for her to criticism of her failure to disclose her sexual relationship with Lanez. Around the time of the documentary\u2019s release,\u00a0 Megan filed a lawsuit against commentator Milagro Gramz, accusing her of being a \u201cmouthpiece,\u201d \u201cpuppet\u201d and \u201cpaid surrogate\u201d for Lanez during and after his high-profile criminal trial.",
      "Gramz addressed the lawsuit on social media, writing in a post on X that she had been \u201cinformed\u201d about the suit, quoting a letter from Megan\u2019s attorney and writing: \u201cOf course we\u2019ll chat about it. They threw in the tape too.\u201d She also posted \u201cCountersuit gone go crazy,\u201d seemingly in reference to the lawsuit.",

      "But perhaps the biggest rise of the year came from Florida-born rapper Doechii. Her ascent to rap prominence followed years of consistency and trial and error. Broader audiences began to pay attention in 2020 when Doechii released her sophomore EP, \u201cOh the Places You\u2019ll Go,\u201d with the viral hit, \u201cYucky Blucky Fruitcake.\u201d",
      "Her star has been on the rise since, with fan-favorite tracks such as \u201cCrazy\u201d and \u201cPersuasive.\u201d But 2024 marked perhaps her most commercially successful year.

    "summary": "Who is player 001 in Squid Game and what does it have to do with the ending of Season 2? Recapping the finale.",
    "story": [
      "Well, it's that time of year again, time for one... more ... game.",
      "Netflix's hit show \"Squid Game\" released its highly anticipated second season on Dec. 26, which consisted of seven episodes.",
      "The second season flashes forward a few years after Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a.k.a. Player 456, won the games. The trauma of everyone's death from Season 1 still weighs heavily on Gi-hun's conscience, causing him to devote himself and the $45.6 billion won (about $31 million dollars) he won to finding and ending the games once and for all.",
      "However, Gi-hun's plans go astray, causing him to be thrown back into the games once more with an entire new set of players.",
      "This time, the twist is that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) who orchestrated all the games during Season 1 decided to enter the games himself, posing as Young-il, Player 001. The Front Man, whose real name is In-Ho, is a former winner of the games.",
      "Gi-hun, who once again plays as Player 456, makes his way through the games, beginning (like Season 1) with Red Light, Green Light, but adding in two new games afterwards: Pentathlon and Mingle.",
      "This season adds the twist that after each round, all players vote to decide if they want to continue the games or end them there.",
      "As the season progresses, Young-il (the Front Man in disguise) befriends Gi-hun, gaining his trust by explaining his own tragic backstory. He says his pregnant wife is dying and he joined the games to get the money to save her and his unborn child. However, viewers know the Front Man's wife already has died.",
      "This duo forms an alliance with other characters, including Gi-hun's best friend from Season 1 Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan) who is also a competitor this season and ex-marine Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul).",
      "Season 2 also introduces new players like mother and son duo Park Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), crypto currency influencer Lee Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan), pregnant player Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri) and rapper Thanos (Choi Seung-hyun), amongst others.",
      "Outside of the games, Detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun), who Front Man seemingly shot and killed in the Season 1 finale, is actually alive. He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",
      "As Gi-hun fights within the games to end them and keep as many people alive as possible, Jun-ho searches for the island with the help of allies Gi-hun enlisted before entering the games a second time.",
      "However, the captain of the boat who has been assisting Jun-ho in finding the island is revealed to be secretly tampering with their search.",
      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",
      "When the guards come in to break up the fight, Gi-hun and his friends, who were playing dead, jump the guards and grab their guns, killing all but one in the process.",
      "Gi-hun instructs the surviving guard to bring them to his captain. The rebel crew shoot out the cameras before continuing on through the island fortress.",
      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",
      "Gi-hun tries to fight back but is wrestled to the ground by pink suited workers as the Front Man (whom Gi-hun still doesn't know is Young-il) walks away.",
      "The show fades to black on Gi-hun screaming with grief as his head is pushed into the ground, forcing him to look at Jung-bae and the pool of blood spilling from him.",
      "What does the post-credit scene mean for Season 3?",
      "The post-credit scene is a brief clip of players walking up to the motion sensor doll from Red Light, Green Light. This time, there's a second gigantic doll across from the original one.",
      "The quick scene ends as the light turns from red to green, hinting that the games continue in some form after the failed coup.",
      "Show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk \"originally envisioned seasons 2 and 3 as a single story,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",
      "Dong-hyuk shared a letter that noted that Season 3 will be the show's final season and can be expected to air sometime in 2025, according to Netflix's companion site Tudum."

      "\"She\u2019s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage,\" she said. \"Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, Blue joined Beyonc\u00e9's halftime performance at the Ravens and Texans game in Houston. She stood alongside her mom during \"Texas Hold 'Em\" to close out the set of songs from \"Cowboy Carter.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 honored her daughter's guest appearance by sneaking in a small lyric change, adding: \"Then spin me in the middle, Blue, I can\u2019t read your mind.\"",
      "While Blue is the most public of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s three children, she has managed to maintain a balance between her public appearances and private life.\u00a0On Feb. 20, 2024, she was seen supporting her mom at the launch of Beyonc\u00e9's new hair care line, C\u00e9cred, in LA. Then, at the 2024 Grammys, Jay-Z brought his daughter onstage to accept the second annual\u00a0Dr. Dre\u00a0Global Impact Award that he received at the event.",
      "In his acceptance speech, he gave Blue a shoutout, saying, \u201cThank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue\u2019s grown up now. She doesn\u2019t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys.\u201d",
      "Carter's eldest has been involved with voice work at a young age. In November 2020, Blue narrated Matthew A. Cherry\u2019s audiobook \u201cHair Love.\u201d In April 2024, Disney announced that she would voice cub Kiara, the daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, in Disney's new live-action prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 will also star in the project, voicing Nala.",
      "Tina Knowles spoke to E! News in August 2024 and praised her granddaughter's many talents.",
      "\"She\u2019s self-taught and she sounds like a concert pianist,\u201d Knowles said of Blue. \u201cShe paints, she draws, she does poetry. She\u2019s just an artistic soul.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really, really proud of her. I can\u2019t wait until the world gets to really hear.\u201d",

      "Rumi Carter, 6",
      "Rumi Carter is the elder of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Like her twin brother, Sir Carter, Rumi was born on June 13, 2017.",
      "In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2019 Netflix documentary,\u00a0\"Homecoming,\" she opened up about the \u201cextremely difficult pregnancy\" that she went through when she had Rumi and Sir.",
      "\"My body went through more than I knew it could,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 noted that during her recovery, she became a vegan and started to accept that her body had become curvier.",
      "\"To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I\u2019m in no rush to get rid of it,\" she said at the time. \"I think it\u2019s real.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's twins have since been featured in a few projects that she's worked on like her\u00a0\"Black is King\"\u00a0visual album, where they made an appearance. Rumi was also in the music video for \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\" along with her sister.",
      "Rumi also took center stage in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album. In the singer\u2019s song \u201cProtector,\u201d Rumi is heard asking her mom, \u201cCan I hear the lullaby please?\u201d at the beginning.",
      "The song appears to be a tribute to her children, with Beyonc\u00e9 singing about motherhood.",
      "She says, \u201cI first saw your face in your father\u2019s gaze/ There\u2019s a long line of hands carryin\u2019 your name, mm/ Liftin\u2019 you up, so you will be raised/ Even though I know someday you\u2019re going to shine on your own/ I will be your projector, yeah.\u201d",
      "Sir Carter, 6",
      "Sir Carter is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s youngest, though only by a minute, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Sir was born on  June 13, 2017, with his twin sister Rumi.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

Speculation about a potential feud reached a fever pitch by mid-August, when backlash began against Lively for the way she was marketing and talking about the film.",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "In the dollhouse, which Kris Jenner had gifted her, she took AD through the customizations her mom picked out for the house, including shopping bags featuring her favorite brands, her dog, Pyro, and horseback riding gear.",

      "\"I was signed on \u2026 and\u00a0then\u00a0I met Chevy Chase,\" Columbus said. \"Even given my situation at the time, where I desperately needed to make a film, I realized I couldn\u2019t work with the guy.",
      "\u201cTale as old as time!\u201d he continued. \u201cI was one of the many who couldn\u2019t work with him. And I called John and I said, \u2018This is really hard for me, but I can\u2019t do this movie with Chevy Chase.\u2019\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Chase for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Columbus said he and legendary producer John Hughes had the same agent, which resulted in Columbus being sent the script for \"Christmas Vacation.\"",
      "The director had begun shooting exterior shots in Chicago for the 1989 movie when he had meetings with Chase that derailed his participation.",
      "\"My first meeting with him, I sat down with him,\" Columbus said. \"It was just the two of us. He\u00a0had\u00a0to know I was directing the movie. I talked about how I saw the movie, how I wanted to make the movie. He didn\u2019t say anything. I went through about a half hour of talking. He didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word.\u00a0And then he stops and he says\u2014and this makes no sense to any human being on the planet, but I\u2019m telling you. I probably have\u00a0never\u00a0told this story.",
      "\"Forty minutes into the meeting, he says, 'Wait a second. You\u2019re the director?' And I said, 'Yeah\u2026I\u2019m directing the film.' And he said to me the most surreal, bizarre thing. I still haven\u2019t been able to make any sense out of it. He said, 'Oh, I thought you were a drummer.' I said, 'Uhh, okay. Let\u2019s start talking about the film again.' After about 30 seconds, he said, 'I got to go.'\"",
      "Columbus said Chase met with Hughes, and they set up a second meeting at dinner with Hughes in attendance.",
      "\"I was basically nonexistent,\" Columbus said. \"It was Chevy and Hughes, and they talked about everything except 'Christmas Vacation.' We spent two hours together, and I left the dinner and I thought, 'There\u2019s no way I can make a movie with this guy. First of all, he\u2019s not engaged. He\u2019s treating me like s---. I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019d rather not work again. I\u2019d rather write.'\"",

So to tell that story almost makes no sense, but it actually happened. I thought, 'This was how we\u2019re going to work together? I\u2019m going to be on set and he\u2019s not listening.'",
      "\"I called John and said, 'I can\u2019t do this,'\" he continued. \"'John, I need this job desperately, but I know I will not make a good movie with this guy and I will let you down.' And he said, 'I understand. Completely understand.'\"",
      "Jeremiah S. Chechik ended up directing \"Christmas Vacation,\" which was the third edition of the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" series, all of them starring Chase.",
      "However, leaving \"Christmas Vacation\" led Columbus right to another holiday classic.",
      "\"The next weekend, I got\u00a0another\u00a0script from John\u2014and it\u2019s\u00a0'Home Alone,'\" he said. \"'Home Alone,' for me, was even more personal, a better script. And I thought, I can really do something with this, and I don\u2019t have to deal with Chevy Chase. That was it.\"",
      "Columbus went on to direct \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and a pair of \"Harry Potter\" blockbuster movies. He is a producer on the upcoming vampire film \"Nosferatu,\" a remake of the 1922 silent classic of the same name."

      "But Russia has since amassed thousands of troops in a counterattack.",
      "Kirby quoted a lower death toll among North Koreans, saying more than 1,000 soldiers have died just in the past week.",
      "That\u2019s on top of the more than 1,500 Russian soldiers being wounded or killed each day, according to Britain\u2019s defense ministry, which estimated that there were over 45,000 casualties in November, the highest since the start of the war, adding that the number \u201cis likely reflective of the higher tempo of Russian operations and offensives.\u201d",

      "Kirby said the North Koreans are conducting \u201cmassed, dismounted assaults against Ukrainian positions in Kursk.\u201d While these \u201chuman wave tactics\u201d were ineffective, he acknowledged that Russia\u2019s grinding assault on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure was making it difficult for Ukrainians to weather the winter.",

It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",

      "Singh was admitted to New Delhi\u2019s All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a \u201csudden loss of consciousness at home,\u201d the hospital said in a statement.",
      "\u201cResuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\u201d at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \u201cdespite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 p.m.\u201d",
      "Singh was being treated for \u201cage-related medical conditions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament\u2019s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the wife of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was re-elected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party\u2019s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India\u2019s \u201cmost distinguished leaders\u201d who rose from humble origins and left \u201ca strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Modi said in a post on the social platform X. He called Singh\u2019s interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker \u201cinsightful\u201d and said \u201chis wisdom and humility were always visible.\u201d",
      "Rahul Gandhi, from the same party as Singh and the opposition leader in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said Singh\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of economics inspired the nation\u201d and that he \u201cled India with immense wisdom and integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have lost a mentor and guide. Millions of us who admired him will remember him with the utmost pride,\u201d Gandhi, the son of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, wrote on X.",

He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as an economic adviser in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India\u2019s second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India\u2019s upper house of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country\u2019s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country\u2019s various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India\u2019s nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",
      "He also tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet, which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "His 1965 book, \u201cIndia\u2019s Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth,\u201d dealt with India\u2019s inward-oriented trade policy.",

The flight attempted to make an emergency landing about 1.8 miles from Aktau, according to Azerbaijan Airlines, but instead hit the ground, erupted into a fiery ball and split in two.",

      "Borie said that, at the time of the incident, Russian air defense forces were defending against a Ukrainian military-grade weaponized drone attack that involved Russia shooting down drones. At least one drone was hit east of Grozny, while others were shot down over Chechnya, he added.",

      "The flight had 62 passengers and five crew members on board, according to the Kazakh Emergencies Ministry. Later, the Kazakh Health Ministry published a list of 29 survivors, including two children.",
      "At least one airline said it is altering its flights in the region in light of the Kazakhstan air crash. El Al, Israel's national carrier, announced Thursday it is suspending its operations on its Tel Aviv-Moscow route for the coming week and will assess when they may resume."

Sirens were also reported in the Russian city of Taganrog, located in Rostov, which borders Ukraine, local authorities said in a post to Telegram.",
      "Two Ukrainian missiles were shot down in the Kursk region with no damage or casualties, according to a post on the Kursk region Telegram channel, after it was announced that the five Russian airports had been shut down.",

      "This comes a month after Ukraine launched its largest drone attack on Moscow\u00a0since the full-scale war began.",
      "The airports temporary closures come on the same day that the Kremlin\u00a0warned against speculating what may have caused an\u00a0Azerbaijan Airlines flight to crash, killing 38 of the 67 people on board, after an aviation expert said evidence indicated that a Russian anti-missile battery may have brought down the passenger plane.",
      "There is growing speculation that Russian air defenses may have been behind the crash, which occurred as the plane approached Grozny, its destination. Chechnya was being attacked by drones at the time.",
      "\u201cSubsequent reporting and contextual information, including the follow-on video examination of the wreckage,\u201d indicated that \u201cthe flight was likely shot down by a Russian air defense system,\u201d said Matthew\u00a0Borie, chief intelligence officer at the aviation security firm Osprey Flight Solutions, in an interview with NBC News.",

      "Twenty years ago, the world was stunned by the Asian tsunami, whose towering waves killed an estimated 230,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and other countries the day after Christmas.",
      "The tsunami, which was triggered by a powerful 9.3-magnitude earthquake off the coast of northern Indonesia, is considered the deadliest natural disaster this century and one of the deadliest in recorded history.",
      "It wiped out villages, disrupted livelihoods and hit a number of popular tourist spots, killing locals as well as visitors from the United States and around the world.",
      "NBC News spoke with three Americans who survived the disaster in Thailand about their experiences.",
      "\u2018Hit by a Mack truck\u2019",
      "Dr. Libby North, a neurologist from Portland, Oregon, was on vacation with her friend Ben Abels in Ko Phi Phi, an island group between Phuket and the Straits of Malacca. On the morning of Dec. 26, 2004, they had gone kayaking and spent some time at the pool before returning to their bungalow right on the beach, which was packed with travelers.",
      "\u201cOnce we were inside, we began to hear some rumbling,\u201d North said. \u201cThen in the next instant, a wave came through the wall and it felt like I was being hit by a Mack truck.\u201d",
      "North was \u201cswept away, traveling at a very high velocity.\u201d",
      "Her body was crushed and contorted, and she lost consciousness.",
      "\u201cAnd then the next instant, the water receded and I was breathing,\u201d North said.",
      "She was alive but pinned down by debris.\u00a0She couldn\u2019t see her arms or legs, and while she was able to move her left hand, \u201cthere was something seriously wrong with my right hand.\u201d",
      "Then another wave came.",
      "Though she was not submerged for long, North said she was shoved farther inland and all of the debris was packed tighter around her. Then it happened again with a third wave.",
      "When the waves finally subsided, there was nothing but silence.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear another person, which made me think that maybe I was one of the only survivors,\u201d North said.",
      "After a while, she heard some faint voices in the distance and \u201cscreamed for my life.\u201d She was rescued by two Thai men who removed the debris, revealing that her right hand \u201cwas essentially amputated\u201d\u00a0and that she had severe injuries to her right leg.",
      "They carried her back to her resort, where she was hoisted into a hovering Thai military helicopter and taken to a hospital in Phuket. She underwent several operations there and in Bangkok, and although her right hand has limited function, it was saved along with her right leg.",
      "Abels did not survive.",
      "\u201cI feared the worst when I didn\u2019t hear him because he was standing right next to me,\u201d North said.",
      "North, who was 34 at the time and very athletic, said she was determined to get back to her life and career.",
      "\u201cI play tennis. I ride a mountain bike. I\u2019m an avid skier. I\u2019m the mother of three teenagers. I\u2019ve had a wonderful life,\u201d she said.",
      "A divine wrong turn",
      "Dipak Jain, an adviser to Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand\u2019s prime minister at the time, had arrived in Phuket the night before with his wife and three children.",
      "After breakfast they decided to head to the beach, but took a wrong turn and ended up on the other side of the lagoon. That\u2019s when they saw the water coming.",
      "\u201cThe scene was like, Niagara Falls is moving towards you,\u201d said Jain, who is from Chicago.",
      "Because of the wrong turn, they were out of harm\u2019s way.",
      "It was \u201ca divine blessing that not a drop of water touched the five of us,\u201d said Jain, who is now a marketing professor at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.",
      "Jain said that for him and others with similar experiences it\u2019s important to accept what happened, \u201cbut feel grateful that you have many more years ahead of you where you can share these stories.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always tell people, forget what you don\u2019t have. Enjoy what you have and make the best use of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd share those moments of joy with others in your life.\u201d",
      "\u2018That\u2019s when the fear kicked in\u2019",
      "Chris Xaver, who was vacationing in Phuket with her then-husband, woke up to water rushing underneath her door. At first they thought it was a water main break, but when they walked up to the beach, it was littered with debris.",
      "Dead fish were littered all the way up to an open-air restaurant a couple of hundred feet from the shoreline, and they realized that \u201csomething had gone really wrong.\u201d",
      "Xaver was in the restaurant with other bewildered hotel guests when another wave came.",
      "The water slammed her into a wall of the restaurant, while her husband \u201cwas carried a full football field away.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was underwater anywhere from over a minute to maybe up to two minutes before the water receded enough that I could stand up and breathe air,\u201d Xaver said.",
      "The force of the water sent tables and chairs piercing into Xaver, leaving a big gash on her head and injuries to her left leg that required 50 stitches.",
      "\u201cTowards the end of that time period underwater, I was pretty sure that I wasn\u2019t going to make it,\u201d she said.",
      "When she was finally able to stand up, she was the only person there. She managed to find her husband, and then someone said a third wave was coming.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when the fear kicked in,\u201d Xaver said. \u201cI knew there was absolutely no way either of us would survive another wave. We couldn\u2019t run. We couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Just then, a van showed up and took them to a hospital, where they were greeted by a vacationing Swedish doctor still in his swim trunks. They spent the next three weeks hospitalized in Phuket and Bangkok before returning to the U.S. on a C-130 military plane.",
      "Xaver said her \u201cwhole body hurt for months.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy entire body, head to toe, top to bottom, fingertips to what felt like hair follicles \u2014 everything hurt,\u201d she said.",
      "She also struggled with guilt that she had survived while so many others had not.",
      "\u201cYou really have to not blame yourself,\u201d Xaver said. \u201cYou truly were allowed to survive for a reason.\u201d",
      "Xaver, who recently retired as a college professor in upstate New York, said after the tsunami she focused less on personal ambition and more on helping others, including by telling her story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t wish ever a disaster of this magnitude on anyone, and I certainly don\u2019t wish that this many people perish,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wish everybody had a scare in their life, something that knocked them upside the head a little bit to say, you know what? This isn\u2019t all about you. There\u2019s more to this world, and it\u2019s about love.\u201d"
