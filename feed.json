      "Hulk Hogan has left an indelible mark on professional wrestling and pop culture",
      "Hulk Hogan\u2019s back had weakened, a failed early attempt at slamming all 525 pounds of Andre the Giant left the \u201cImmortal One\" unsteady as the World Wrestling Federation champion once more needed to rally to beat another of wrestling\u2019s baddest bad guys.",
      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "Her stage career began in 1958 when she was invited to join the cast of a West Indian play, \"Flesh to a Tiger,\" at the Royal Court Theatre, and was surprised to find herself in the lead role. She won a Moscow Arts Theatre Award for her performance.",

      "The following year, she and Dankworth drew a sold-out audience at Carnegie Hall, launching a series of popular appearances. \"Cleo at Carnegie\" won a Grammy award in 1986, the same year she was a Tony nominee for \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\"",
      "A reviewer for Variety in 2002 found her voice going strong: \"a dark, creamy voice, remarkable range and control from bottomless contralto to a sweet clear soprano. Her perfect pitch and phrasing is always framed with musical imagination and good taste.\"",
      "Perhaps Laine's most difficult performance of all was on Feb. 6, 2010, at a concert celebrating the 40th anniversary of the concert venue she and Dankworth had founded at their home, during which Laine and both of her children performed.",
      "\"I'm terribly sorry that Sir John can't be here today,\" Laine told the crowd at the end of the show. \u201cBut earlier on my husband died in hospital.\u201d",
      "Laine said in an interview with the Boston Globe in 2003 that the secret of her longevity was that \"I was never a complete belter.\"",
      "\"There was always a protective side in me, and an inner voice always said, 'Don't do that \u2014 it's not good for you and your voice.'\"",

      "\u201cWho they came to see?\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 asks as she performs her 2023 single \u201cMy House\u201d during the Cowboy Carter tour. For many, the answer has been Blue Ivy.",
      "Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now.",
      "Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyonc\u00e9 for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy\u2019s moves in person.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying, \u201cOh, she\u2019s a mini Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d but no, I think she\u2019s the first Blue. Everything about her when she\u2019s on stage is electrifying,\u201d said Kerr.",
      "The Cowboy Carter tour concludes Saturday in Las Vegas. The tour\u2019s 30 previously stops have fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse.",
      "Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother\u2019s 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems \u201cMy Power\u201d and \u201cBlack Parade.\u201d Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop.",
      "She performed again during \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Bowl,\u201d the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. She danced alongside the icon as she performed songs from the \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album for the first time.",
      "\u201cEven the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she\u2019s really grown in her confidence,\u201d said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. \u201cYou can tell she has a different vibe about her.\u201d",
      "On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother\u2019s choreography from her 2006 \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0-vu\u201d music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two.",
      "Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother\u2019s during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her \u201cAmerica Has a Problem\u201d choreography.",
      "In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hair. Blue remained calm, removed the jewelry and motioned to the singer that it was safe in her hand as they both seamlessly continued.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the family business,\u201d said Kinitra D. Brooks, an academic and author of \u201cThe Lemonade Reader,\u201d a collection that explores the nuances of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 visual album, \u201cLemonade.\u201d \u201cShe is literally studying under the best person doing it out there today. Why wouldn\u2019t she take advantage of that opportunity?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. Beyonc\u00e9 expressed how nervous she was about her child being in front of thousands of people made her, revealing she initially said no.",
      "\u201cI did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI made a deal with her, and I said, \u2018If you practice and you show your commitment, I\u2019ll let you do one show.\u2019\u201d Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the \u201cIvy League.\u201d",
      "Kerr says Blue\u2019s accomplishments inspire her to work harder to achieve her own dreams. \u201cShe worked to be on stage, and look at her now. If I work to what I want to be, I can be killing it like her.\u201d",
      "At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for \u2014 Blue Ivy merchandise. Shirts with the teen\u2019s face and the phrase \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Blue\u201d plastered on the front were available for purchase.",

      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring.

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",

      "Ozzy Osbourne's image forever changed with the 2002 debut of his family reality show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There was Ozzy before \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d and Ozzy after \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "For much of his life, the Black Sabbath founder and legendary heavy metal frontman who died at 76 on Tuesday was known to much of the public as a dark purveyor of deeds ranging from decadent to downright Satanic.",
      "Wild stories followed him. Clergy condemned him. Parents sued him.",
      "But with the debut of his family reality show on MTV, the world learned what those who'd been paying closer attention already knew: Ozzy Osbourne was soft and fuzzy under the darkness.",
      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",
      "Danny Deraney, a publicist who worked with Osbourne and was a lifelong fan, said of the show, \"You saw some guy who was curious. You saw some guy who was being funny. You just saw pretty much the real thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that everyone associates with the \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019 and all this craziness,\u201d Deraney said. \"And people loved him. He became so affable to so many people because of that show. As metal fans, we knew it. We knew that\u2019s who he was. But now everyone knew.\u201d",
      "Reality shows at the time, especially the popular competition shows like \u201cSurvivor,\u201d thrived on heightened circumstances. For \u201cThe Osbournes,\u201d no stakes were too low.",
      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",
      "\u201cYou were seeing this really fascinating, appealing, bizarre tension between the public persona of a celebrity and their mundane experiences at home,\u201d said Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic for Vulture and New York Magazine.",

      "Like family sitcoms, the affection its leads clearly had for each other was essential to its appeal.",
      "\u201cFor some reason, we kind of just fell in love with them the same way that we grew to love Ozzy and Sharon as like a marital unit,\" Caruso said.",
      "What was maybe strangest about the show was how not-strange it felt. The two Ozzies seemed seamless rather than contradictory.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re realizing that these things are personas and that all personas are these like elaborate complex mosaics of like who a person is,\u201d VanArendonk said.",

(AP) \u2014 Jimmy Buffett \u2019s widow has accused her late husband\u2019s financial adviser of failing to administer the singer\u2019s multimillion-dollar trust in good faith and ignoring what she believed were her best interests for the $275 million estate.",
      "Jane Buffett on Monday asked a judge in West Palm Beach, Florida, to stop Richard Mozenter from trying to remove her as a trustee and instead sought an order removing him from overseeing the estate, according to court papers.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",
      "\u201cUnilaterally withdrawing the United States from UNESCO is another assault by the Trump administration on international cooperation and U.S. global leadership,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.",

      "The withdrawal, which was first reported by the New York Post, came after a review ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year. While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",
      "Bruce hinted later Tuesday that further U.S. withdrawal from international organizations could be coming as a result of the ongoing review to ensure \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in international organizations will focus on advancing American interests with clarity and conviction.\u201d",
      "Azoulay pledged that UNESCO will carry out its missions despite \u201cinevitably reduced resources.\u201d The agency said that it is not considering any staff layoffs at this stage.",

      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",

There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended.

The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "The decision, announced late Monday, comes just days after the company rebuffed FDA regulators in an extremely unusual decision that alarmed investors and analysts.",

      "Elevidys is the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. for Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy, the fatal muscle-wasting disease that affects boys and young men, resulting in early death. The one-time treatment was initially approved for boys age 4 and younger who could still walk. Last year, FDA expanded approval to older patients who are no longer able to walk.",

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

      "But increasingly organs are donated after circulatory death, called DCD \u2013 when people die because their heart stops. It usually happens when doctors determine someone has a nonsurvivable injury and the family withdraws life support.",
      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes. Massa said every hospital doctor and nurse now gets a checklist on caring for potential donors and how to pause when concerns are raised \u2014 and anyone can anonymously report complaints.",

      "France's highest court is ruling on whether it can strip Bashar al-Assad, the former Syrian leader now in exile in Russia, of his immunity as a head of state",
      "BRUSSELS -- France's highest court is ruling Friday on whether it can strip the head of state immunity of Bashar Assad, the former leader of Syria now in exile in Russia, because of the brutality of the evidence in accusations against him collected by Syrian activists and European prosecutors.",
      "If the judges at the Cour de Cassation lift Assad's immunity, it could pave the way for his trial in absentia over the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta in 2013 and Douma in 2018, and set a precedent to allow the prosecution of other government leaders linked to atrocities, human rights activists and lawyers say.",
      "Assad has retained no lawyers for these charges and has denied he was behind the chemical attacks.",
      "A ruling against Assad would be \u201ca huge victory for the victims,\u201d said Mazen Darwish, president of the Syrian Center for Media which collected evidence of war crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about Syrians, this will open the door for the victims from any country and this will be the first time that a domestic investigative judge has the right to issue an arrest warrant for a president during his rule.\u201d",
      "He said the ruling could enable his group to legally go after regime members, like launching a money laundering case against former Syrian Central Bank governor and Minister of Economy Adib Mayaleh, whose lawyers have argued he had immunity under international law.",
      "For over 50 years, Syria was ruled by Hafez Assad and then his son Bashar. During the Arab Spring, rebellion broke out against their tyrannical rule in 2011 across the country of 23 million, igniting a brutal 13-year civil war that killed more than half a million people, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. Millions more fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Europe. The Assad dynasty manipulated sectarian tensions to stay in power, a legacy driving renewed violence in Syria against minority groups despite promises that the country\u2019s new leaders will carve out a political future for Syria that includes and represents all its communities.",
      "The ruling stripping Assad's immunity could set a \u201csignificant precedent\u201d that \u201ccould really set the stage for potentially for other cases in national jurisdictions that strike down immunities,\" said Mariana Pena, a human rights lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative, which helped bring the case to court.",
      "As the International Criminal Court has issued arrests warrants for leaders accused of atrocities \u2014 like Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza, and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines \u2014 the French judges\u2019 ruling could empower the legal framework to prosecute not just deposed and exiled leaders but those currently in power.",
      "The Syrian government denied in 2013 that it was behind the Ghouta attack, an accusation the opposition rejected as Assad\u2019s forces were the only side in the brutal civil war to possess sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation, but Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Assad to give up his chemical weapons\u2019 stockpile.",
      "Assad survived more than a decade longer, aided militarily by Russia and Iranian-backed proxies. Activists and human rights group accuse him of using barrel bombs, torture, and massacres to crush opponents. But then in late 2024, a surprise assault by rebels swept into Aleppo and then Damascus, driving the dictator to flee for his ally Russia on Dec. 8, 2024. While Darwish and others plan to press Interpol and Russia to extradite him, they know it is unlikely. But an arrest warrant issued by France could lay the groundwork for the former dictator\u2019s trial in absentia or potential arrest if he travels outside Russia.",
      "Any trial of Assad, whether in absentia or if he leaves Russia, would mean this evidence could then \u201cbe brought to light,\u201d Pena said, including an enormous trove of classified and secret evidence amassed by the judges during their investigations.",
      "Syrians often took great personal risk to gather evidence of war crimes. Darwish said that in the aftermath of a chlorine gas attack in Douma, for example, teams collected eyewitness testimonies, images of devastation, and soil samples. Others then tracked down and interviewed defectors to build a \u201cchain of command\u201d for the regime\u2019s chemical weapons production and use.",

      "With the war now in its fourth year after Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor, the effort is draining resources on both sides, although Russia has more resources and people to sustain its fight. Ukraine is seeking further support from Western partners.",

      "Russia has also intensified its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, and Zelenskyy said Ukraine is working with international partners to secure 10 U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, with three already confirmed from Germany and Norway.",
      "The Trump administration will sell the systems, he said, but Ukraine\u2019s task is to find funding for all 10. Each system costs more than $1 billion.",

      "Lebanese composer and playwright Ziad Rahbani has died at 69, according to the National News Agency",
      "BEIRUT -- Ziad Rahbani, a visionary Lebanese composer, playwright, pianist and political provocateur, died on Saturday, at the age of 69, according to the state-run National News Agency.",
      "The death was confirmed by a person close to Rahbani who spoke on condition of anonymity. The cause of death was not immediately clear.",
      "Born in 1956 in Antelias, near Beirut, Ziad was the eldest son of legendary Lebanese singer Fayrouz and late composer Assi Rahbani, one half of the famed Rahbani Brothers. From a young age, he showed signs of prodigious talent, composing his first musical work at just 17 years old. Raised among artistic royalty, his world was steeped in music, theater, and political consciousness \u2014 a combination that would define his life\u2019s work.",
      "His mother, considered to be the most famous and esteemed performer in the Arab world, performed some of his compositions at her sellout concerts, blending Lebanese folklore with Western syncopation and phrasing.",
      "Lebanese President Joseph Aoun mourned Rahbani\u2019s death as a national loss, describing him as \u201cnot just an artist, but a complete intellectual and cultural phenomenon.\u201d In a statement, Aoun praised Rahbani as \u201ca living conscience, a rebellious voice against injustice, and an honest mirror reflecting the suffering and marginalized.\u201d",
      "He highlighted how Rahbani\u2019s fusion of classical, jazz and Oriental music \u201copened new windows for Lebanese cultural expression\u201d and elevated it to global levels. \u201cZiad was a natural extension of the Rahbani family, which gave Lebanon much beauty and dignity,\u201d the president added.",
      "While his parents helped construct a golden era of Lebanese musical theater steeped in idealism and nostalgia, Rahbani charged onto the scene with irreverent satire, unflinching political critique and jazz-inflected scores that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of a Lebanon at war with itself.",
      "\u201cI admire the music of composers like Charlie Parker, Stan Getz and Dizzy Gillespie,\u201d he once said. \u201cBut my music is not Western, it\u2019s Lebanese, with a different way of expression.\u201d",
      "Rahbani\u2019s music reflected the hybrid heritage of Lebanon, which until the civil war erupted in 1975 was a cultural melting pot where East met West. But it was also deeply rooted in the traumatic events of the sectarian strife, the bloody street battles between rival militias and three years of violent Israeli occupation after the 1982 invasion.",
      "His breakout play, Nazl el-Sourour (Happiness Hotel), premiered in 1974 when he was only 17 and portrayed a society disfigured by class inequality and repression. The tragicomic narrative follows a group of workers who hijack a restaurant to demand their rights, only to be dismissed by the political elite. With this bold debut, Rahbani revealed his enduring theme: that Lebanese society was fractured not only by war but by entrenched power.",
      "A leftist Greek Orthodox, Rahbani also wrote plays and satirical radio shows centered on his violent environment that mock the sectarian divisions of his country.",

(What About Tomorrow?), he plays a jaded bar pianist in post-civil war Beirut who drifts through a surreal landscape of broken dreams, corruption and absurdity. The work features some of Rahbani\u2019s most poignant music and biting commentary, including the famous line, \u201cThey say tomorrow will be better, but what about today?\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also mourned Rahbani's loss, describing him as \u201can exceptional and creative artist\u2014a free voice who remained true to the values of justice and dignity.\u201d",
      "More than just a playwright, Rahbani was a composer of staggering range. He infused traditional Arabic melodies with jazz, funk and classical influences, creating a hybrid sound that became instantly recognizable. His live performances were legendary, whether playing piano in smoky clubs in Hamra, one of Beirut's major commercial districts that harbors a multifaceted identity, or orchestrating large-scale productions.",
      "His collaborations with Fayrouz, especially during the late 1970s and 1980s, ushered in a darker, more politically charged phase in her career. Songs like Ouverture 83, Bala Wala Chi (Without Anything), and Kifak Inta (How Are You) reflected Ziad\u2019s brooding compositions and lyrical introspection.",
      "Rahbani came under fire from Arab traditionalists for his pioneering efforts to bridge the gap between Arab and Western culture with music.",
      "In recent years, Ziad appeared less in the public eye, yet his influence never waned. Younger generations rediscovered his plays online and sampled his music in protest movements. He continued to compose and write, speaking often of his frustration with Lebanon\u2019s political stagnation and decaying public life.",
      "Rahbani is survived by his mother, Fayrouz, now 90, his sister Reema and brother Hali.",
      "Lebanese pop star Elissa joined the outpouring of tributes to Ziad Rahbani, writing on X, \u201cZiad_Rahbani was not an ordinary artist ... With his loss today, Lebanon has lost a part of itself and a big piece of its collective memory.\"",

      "\u201cI assure you that going forward I\u2019m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,\u201d Policy said.",
      "Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers\u2019 retirement policy.",
      "\u201cIn my career \u2013 business and with the league and others \u2013 you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Policy, 54, didn\u2019t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy.",
      "There were plenty of shouts of \u201cThank you, Mark,\u201d among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy\u2019s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others.",
      "Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers\u2019 Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bittersweet,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I\u2019m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.\u201d",
      "The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team\u2019s chief executive. He was on Washington\u2019s 1982 championship team.",
      "His stint as Green Bay\u2019s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.",
      "He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous for us,\u201d wide receiver Jayden Reed said. \u201cI thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn\u2019t be standing in this locker room right now. He\u2019s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.\u201d",

      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods.

In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "\u201cThis Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States \u201cwill continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.\u201d",
      "The president said Japan would invest \u201cat my direction\u201d $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.",
      "Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together.",
      "With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker \u2014 even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.",
      "But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.",
      "The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.",
      "As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.",
      "The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.",
      "The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks.",

      "Not only did Goldschmidt\u2019s throw not get the second out of the seventh inning but the Gold Glove first baseman's miscue was the ninth error in four games for the Yankees, who committed two Friday night in a 12-5 loss to Philadelphia that dropped them 5 1/2 games back of AL East-leading Toronto.",

I think even if I put that throw perfect, Turner\u2019s probably still beating that out.\"",

At the edge of the grass, Goldschmidt moved to his right, made an off-balance throw and the ball sailed over catcher Austin Wells\u2019 glove as Turner scored the tying run, Schwarber took third and Castellanos second.",
      "\u201cProbably too aggressive of a play by me to try and make a play where they were going to be safe anyway and it led to another base runner rather than just getting the out at first,\" Goldschmidt said. \"So that was a mistake.\u201d",

      "\u201cUsually, this is the most important part of the season for me,\u201d Medvedev said in an interview in Washington, where he was scheduled to play Corentin Moutet in the quarterfinals on Friday. \u201cAnd this year, it's really important for me, because I didn\u2019t have the best year. I had a lot of time after Wimbledon, so I'm feeling ready and I feel in good shape.\"",

      "\u201cA lot of different things. My ball goes through the air the most. My serve goes faster. And this year, the courts seem pretty fast. On the ATP lately, the courts seem to only get slower and slower. But here it\u2019s super fast. I like the way it plays,\u201d said Medvedev, who has been ranked No. 1 and is No. 14 this week, his lowest spot in more than six years. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to like the way it plays and it\u2019s another thing to win. But I do feel like I can do big things.\u201d",

      "Any list would have to start with his championship at the 2021 U.S. Open, where his victory in the final prevented Novak Djokovic from completing the first calendar-year Grand Slam by a man since Rod Laver in 1969. Medvedev was the runner-up to Rafael Nadal in New York in 2019 \u2014 who could forget the back-and-forths with spectators that year? \u2014 and then to Djokovic in 2023.",
      "Medvedev also participated in three finals at the Australian Open, losing to Djokovic in 2021, to Nadal in 2022 and to current No. 1 Jannik Sinner in 2024.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- College football's future wore a baby blue suit, a gold pin that said \u201cUCLA\u201d and a pair of diamond-encrusted hoop earrings.",
      "He glided toward the mic, sat down, then prepared for the grilling about how much money he makes, why he left Tennessee, who betrayed who when he departed, and what it all means for the college football world that his story now defines.",
      "Bottom line: If quarterback Nico Iamaleava handles the rest of the season as well as he did with his half hour of Q&A at Big Ten media days Thursday, chances are, UCLA will be good \u2014 maybe even very good \u2014 in 2025.",
      "\u201cI think, it's just, keep my head down and be humble,\u201d the 20-year-old lightning rod of a quarterback said. \u201cAnd try not to let the outside noise affect you.\u201d",
      "If he succeeds at that, he will have more discipline than a great majority of college football fans, experts and journalists who have filled the internet and air waves with timelines and tick-tock analysis of a decision that shook the sport and seemed to say everything about the burgeoning power players wield in a world of name, image, likeness deals and a rapidly rotating transfer portal.",
      "The thumbnail of the story is that Iamaleava was a successful quarterback who led Tennessee to the College Football Playoff last season, then abruptly picked up stakes to head closer to home and play for UCLA.",
      "Money seemed to be the most obvious motive.",
      "Reports circulated that he was looking for a raise \u2014 maybe a doubling to nearly $4 million a year \u2014 to come back to the Vols. Then, one day last spring, Iamaleava missed practice. Just as abruptly, he was gone.",
      "Tennessee coach Josh Heupel handled it diplomatically.",
      "\u201cToday's landscape of college football is different than it has been,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's unfortunate, the situation, and where we're at with Nico.\u201d",
      "Before he'd even enrolled at Tennessee, Iamaleava was causing his share of turmoil. It was his NIL deal with the Vols that triggered an NCAA investigation and a lawsuit by the attorneys general of Tennessee and Virginia in January 2024.",
      "The NCAA settled that lawsuit, and though there aren't as many questions about who makes the payments to the players (the colleges can do it themselves now), recriminations that flowed when Iamaleava enrolled at Tennessee kept flowing after he made his move to UCLA.",
      "Asked about what triggered his move and exactly when it happened, Iamaleava said it came around the time \u201cfalse stuff about whether it was a financial thing or not\u201d started coming out that made him \"not feel comfortable in the position I was in.\u201d",
      "Then, in a revelation that not everyone appears quite ready to accept, he said moving closer to where he grew up, in Long Beach, California, about 30 miles from the UCLA campus, was the biggest piece of the puzzle.",
      "\u201cMy driving factor to come back home was my family, and I hope every Tennessee fan understands that,\u201d he said. \"It was really one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve ever had to make.\u201d",
      "He will not delve into finances, though most of the reporting has shown that Iamaleava will make about as much, or just barely more, with UCLA than he was making at Tennessee.",

      "Among the other questions consuming college football, and that Iamaleava's saga reflects as well as anyone's, is how a player who makes more money and generates more hype than anyone else in the locker room can possibly fit on a team that is still, at its core, filled with teenagers whose football lives will end in college.",
      "UCLA's second-year coach, DeShaun Foster, said he scouted that part when the prospect of Iamaleava coming to Westwood became real.",
      "\u201cHe's a team guy and a family guy,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIt just felt good that we were getting the right kind of quarterback.\u201d",
      "From a pure talent standpoint, hardly anyone argues that. Iamaleava was considered one of the country's top prospects coming out of high school. He threw for 2,616 yards and 19 TDs last year in leading the Vols to the playoffs.",
      "But, as one of the theories about his departure goes, he and his family were less than thrilled about Tennessee's ability to protect him.",
      "None other than ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit dove into the mix when he said he'd heard Iamaleava's dad had gone to Heupel in December and said \u201clike, hey, listen, you\u2019ve got to get better at offensive line, better at receiver.\u201d",
      "Speaking not so much about that specific story, but to the realities of football, Foster said he knows keeping things clean in the pocket for Iamaleava will be key to his success.",
      "\u201cIf he stays upright, things are going to go the right way,\" Foster said.",
      "And if they do, there's at least a chance Iamaleava could be a one-and-doner at UCLA. He is widely thought to have NFL talent if he improves his mechanics and accuracy \u2014 two areas that will be helped by better protection.",
      "During his back-and-forth with reporters, the quarterback brushed aside questions about pro football.",
      "He also said he pays no mind to the billion-dollar questions swirling around the college game every day \u2014 all revolving around money, freedom to transfer and other issues that have turned UCLA's quarterback into a villian in some places, a hero in others, and a player to watch everyhwere.",
      "\u201cI love college football,\" he said. \"Everything that goes on with my name, that's not going to change my love for the game. Obviously, everyone has to move on. I'm excited about what's next for me. But I'm where my feet (are), and right now, I'm a UCLA football player and I'm excited to go to camp.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Tech companies selling AI to the federal government now face a new challenge: proving their chatbots aren't \"woke.\"",
      "Tech companies looking to sell their artificial intelligence technology to the federal government must now contend with a new regulatory hurdle: proving their chatbots aren't \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even prohibit an ideological agenda,\u201d just that any intentional methods to guide the model be disclosed, said Chilson, head of AI policy at the nonprofit Abundance Institute. \u201cWhich is pretty light touch, frankly.\u201d",

      "With their AI tools already widely used in the federal government, tech companies have reacted cautiously. OpenAI on Thursday said it is awaiting more detailed guidance but believes its work to make ChatGPT objective already makes the technology consistent with Trump's directive.",
      "Microsoft, a major supplier of online services to the government, declined to comment.",
      "Musk's xAI, through spokesperson Katie Miller, a former Trump official, pointed to a company comment praising Trump's AI announcements but didn't address the procurement order. xAI recently announced it was awarded a U.S. defense contract for up to $200 million, just days after Grok publicly posted a barrage of antisemitic commentary that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Palantir didn't respond to emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "The ideas behind the order have bubbled up for more than a year on the podcasts and social media feeds of Trump's top AI adviser David Sacks and other influential Silicon Valley venture capitalists, many of whom endorsed Trump's presidential campaign last year. Their ire centered on Google's February 2024 release of an AI image-generating tool that produced historically inaccurate images before the tech giant took down and fixed the product.",
      "Google later explained that the errors \u2014 including generating portraits of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show American Founding Fathers \u2014 were the result of an overcompensation for technology that, left to its own devices, was prone to favoring lighter-skinned people because of pervasive bias in the systems.",
      "Trump allies alleged that Google engineers were hard-coding their own social agenda into the product.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 100% intentional,\u201d said prominent venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen on a podcast in December. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get Black George Washington at Google. There\u2019s override in the system that basically says, literally, \u2018Everybody has to be Black.\u2019 Boom. There\u2019s squads, large sets of people, at these companies who determine these policies and write them down and encode them into these systems.\u201d",
      "Sacks credited a conservative strategist who has fought DEI initiatives at colleges and workplaces for helping to draft the order.",
      "\u201cWhen they asked me how to define \u2018woke,\u2019 I said there\u2019s only one person to call: Chris Rufo. And now it\u2019s law: the federal government will not be buying WokeAI,\u201d Sacks wrote on X.",
      "Rufo responded that he helped \u201cidentify DEI ideologies within the operating constitutions of these systems.\u201d",
      "But some who agreed that Biden went too far promoting DEI also worry that Trump\u2019s new order sets a bad precedent for future government efforts to shape AI\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea of achieving ideological neutrality with AI models is really just unworkable,\u201d said Ryan Hauser of the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank. \u201cAnd what do we get? We get these frontier labs just changing their speech to meet the political requirements of the moment.\u201d",

      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",
      "The unveiling is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and entrepreneurs who include Trump\u2019s AI czar, David Sacks.",
      "The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday\u2019s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It might also include some of the AI culture war preoccupations of the circle of venture capitalists who endorsed Trump last year.",

      "\u201cThe AI\u2019s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it\u2019s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,\u201d Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the \u201cBlack George Washington\u201d moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.",
      "The administration\u2019s latest push against \u201cwoke AI\u201d comes a week after the Pentagon announced new $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google, to address \u201ccritical national security challenges.\u201d",
      "Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk\u2019s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d companies. The company has faced its own challenges: Earlier this month, xAI had to scramble to remove posts made by its Grok chatbot that made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler.",

OpenAI announced this week that it has switched on the first phase of a massive data center complex in Abilene, Texas, part of an Oracle-backed project known as Stargate that Trump promoted earlier this year. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and xAI also have major projects underway.",

      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",

In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\u201cOne of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\u201d said Telzer. \u201cThey need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\u201d",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\u201cIf you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\u201d Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried that kids could get lost in this,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\u201d",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children\u2019s mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\u201d Nair said. \u201cI think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the new addiction,\u201d Nair added. \u201cThat\u2019s how I see it.\u201d",

And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",

Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",

      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England\u2019s south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",
      "\u201cThe community have been so keen, have been so desirous to be involved and to find out things to learn, and they\u2019re so proud of it. It\u2019s down to them it was discovered, it\u2019s down to them it was recovered and it\u2019s been stabilized and been protected,\u201d he said.",
      "For locals, it\u2019s a link to the island\u2019s maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\u201d said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, issuing the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide since a key Supreme Court decision in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, joining another district court as well as an appellate panel of judges, found that a nationwide injunction granted to more than a dozen states remains in force under an exception to the Supreme Court ruling. That decision restricted the power of lower-court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.",
      "The states have argued Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order is blatantly unconstitutional and threatens millions of dollars for health insurance services that are contingent on citizenship status. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who helped lead the lawsuit before Sorokin, said in a statement he was \u201cthrilled the district court again barred President Trump\u2019s flagrantly unconstitutional birthright citizenship order from taking effect anywhere.\u201d",
      "\"American-born babies are American, just as they have been at every other time in our Nation\u2019s history,\u201d he added. \"The President cannot change that legal rule with the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the government had argued Sorokin should narrow the reach of his earlier ruling granting a preliminary injunction, saying it should be \u201ctailored to the States\u2019 purported financial injuries.\u201d",
      "Sorokin said a patchwork approach to the birthright order would not protect the states in part because a substantial number of people move between states. He also blasted the Trump administration, saying it had failed to explain how a narrower injunction would work.",
      "\u201cThat is, they have never addressed what renders a proposal feasible or workable, how the defendant agencies might implement it without imposing material administrative or financial burdens on the plaintiffs, or how it squares with other relevant federal statutes,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cIn fact, they have characterized such questions as irrelevant to the task the Court is now undertaking. The defendants\u2019 position in this regard defies both law and logic.\u201d",
      "Sorokin acknowledged his order would not be the last word on birthright citizenship. Trump and his administration \u201care entitled to pursue their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and no doubt the Supreme Court will ultimately settle the question,\u201d Sorokin wrote. \u201cBut in the meantime, for purposes of this lawsuit at this juncture, the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The administration has not yet appealed any of the recent court rulings. Trump\u2019s efforts to deny citizenship to children born to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily will remain blocked unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise.",

The Supreme Court did not decide whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.",
      "Plaintiffs in the Boston case earlier argued that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution,\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",

Female legislators \u2014 41 of the 138 member Legislature \u2014 needing a reprieve during a lengthy floor session have to weigh the risk of missing an important debate or a critical vote.",

      "Countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo is leading an effort to revive the Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- One of the most famous organs in the world, which graces one of Philadelphia's favorite public spaces, was at risk of going quiet this spring when Macy\u2019s closed up shop in the city's storied Wanamaker Building.",
      "But countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, the avant-garde opera star hired last year to run Opera Philadelphia, is leading an effort to let the public again enjoy the Wanamaker Organ, a National Historic Landmark-designated treasure. The organ boasts more than 28,000 wood and metal pipes hidden behind a soaring wall of gold-leaf pipes that frame the building\u2019s seven-story marble atrium.",
      "Costanzo, with $1 million in philanthropic funding, is organizing a series of public performances this fall \u2014 including opera, ballet, theater and drag \u2014 before renovations begin next year on the building\u2019s conversion to a retail and residential hub. The first event is set for Sunday, Sept. 7.",
      "\u201cJohn Wanamaker, when he built this Grand Court, said he wanted it to be the intersection of arts and commerce, and that\u2019s why he put the world\u2019s largest pipe organ into it,\u201d Costanzo told The Associated Press in an onsite interview Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cThis space is operatic,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought it was a perfect umbrella to bring in every arts organization I could, and all these different collaborators.\u201d",
      "The organ was made for the 1904 World\u2019s Fair in St. Louis. Wanamaker, a successful merchant and civic leader, had it moved to his new emporium next to City Hall in 1909 and then hired a crew of 40 pipe makers to enlarge it so the sound filled the vast space. A decade later, famed conductor Leopold Anthony Stokowski performed there with the Philadelphia Orchestra as 15,000 people crowded into the great hall and mezzanines.",

      "Local civic groups, in an announcement Friday, said they hope to raise funds to bring back one of the city\u2019s most beloved annual events, a holiday light show that drew generations of families to the store.",
      "Costanzo, who continues to perform around the world, believes he can build enthusiasm for the arts by bringing it to the places where people gather, including the Wanamaker Building. And he hopes that, in turn, will help people find a way to connect with each other.",

      "WAIANAE, Hawaii -- Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.",
      "The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside U.S. Army recreation center in Waianae, about an hour\u2019s drive from Honolulu.",
      "Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message.",
      "\u201cIt's telling the community that the ocean is rising,\u201d said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.",
      "Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.",
      "John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.",
      "\u201cIt was so interesting to touch them,\u201d said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. \u201cIt felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that.\u201d",
      "It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.",
      "The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.",
      "Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.",
      "The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.",
      "When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.",

      "Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.",
      "Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.",
      "In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So \"the ocean and mountains were our playground,\u201d he said. The Army recreation center was off-limits to the pubic, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.",
      "Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.",
      "\u201cWe were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee on Friday told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to make additional payments for her attendance at the 2021 Met Fashion Gala, where she drew attention for wearing a dress adorned with the message \u201ctax the rich.\"",
      "The ethics panel, which found the New York Democrat had underpaid for some of the services and clothing for the event, also issued reports Friday on unrelated ethics allegations against Reps. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick or Florida and Henry Cuellar of Texas.",
      "In a 31-page report on the allegations against Ocasio-Cortez, the Ethics Committee said she had tried to comply with House rules on accepting gifts but failed by \u201cimpermissibly accepting a gift of free admission to the 2021 Met Gala for her partner and by failing to pay full fair market value for some of the items worn to the event.\u201d",
      "As a guest of Vogue, Ocasio-Cortez and her partner received tickets to the gala valued at $35,000, as well as customized clothing, hair and makeup styling and a hotel room to prepare for the high-society event.",
      "The congresswoman worked with an attorney to comply with House ethics rules and paid for most of the goods and services with personal funds, but the ethics panel found \"the payments were significantly delayed and some payments fell short of fair market value.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Mike Casca, said: \u201cThe Congresswoman appreciates the Committee finding that she made efforts to ensure her compliance with House Rules and sought to act consistently with her ethical requirements as a Member of the House. She accepts the ruling and will remedy the remaining amounts, as she\u2019s done at each step in this process.\u201d",
      "The House Ethics Committee issued a formal reproval Friday of Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., following a yearslong investigation into an insider-trading allegation over his wife\u2019s purchase of stock in a steel company in his Butler-area congressional district.",
      "The panel also said Kelly and his wife, Victoria Kelly, should divest of any stock in the company, Cleveland-Cliffs, before the congressman takes any further official actions related to it.",
      "While the committee said it \u201cdid not find evidence\u201d that Kelly \u201cknowingly or intentionally caused his spouse to trade based on insider information,\u201d its report also said it \u201cdid not receive full cooperation from Mrs. Kelly and was therefore unable to determine whether her stock purchase was improper.\u201d",
      "However, the report said, \u201cRepresentative Kelly\u2019s failure to acknowledge the seriousness of the alleged misconduct\u201d and of the investigation itself was a violation of the code of official conduct. The committee did \u201cnot find a clear violation\u201d of conflict of interest.",
      "The congressman said in a statement Friday, \u201cMy family and I look forward to putting this distraction behind us.\"",
      "Kelly noted the investigation has \u201cunnecessarily\u201d lasted for nearly five years, and in the time since the Cleveland Cliffs Butler Works plant faced an uncertain future.",
      "\u201cThroughout this process, I have fought for the 1,400 workers at the plant, I\u2019ve spoken with these workers, and they appreciate the hard work we have done to fight for those jobs and for Butler,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "The investigation was launched after a July 2021 referral regarding allegations the congressman\u2019s wife may have purchased stock based on confidential or nonpublic information he had learned during official duties.",

      "Beresky said Vallow Daybell was not truthful when she claimed she was prevented from telling her side of the story and was unable to get a fair trial. The media attention she craved, he said, will fade into obscurity now that her trials are over.",
      "\u201cThe amount of contemplation, calculation, planning and manipulation that went into these crimes is unparalleled in my career,\u201d said Beresky, who has been a Maricopa County Superior Court judge since 2017 and has presided over other high-profile cases.",

The groups are authorized to make unannounced visits to group homes and interview residents alone.",

      "China's reliance on exports for economic growth will be a key topic in U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm",
      "BEIJING -- China\u2019s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries.",
      "Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week.",
      "The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports.",
      "\u201cWe could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,\u201d Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, \u201ccan\u2019t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.\u201d",
      "The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries.",
      "Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with \u201cartificially cheap Chinese products.\u201d The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China.",
      "In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China\u2019s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan.",
      "Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure.",
      "Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are \u201cracing to the bottom,\u201d skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs.",
      "With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash.",

    "story": [
      "Academics around the country are raising alarm about growing efforts to define antisemitism on terms pushed by the Trump administration",
      "NEW YORK -- For years, Marianne Hirsch, a prominent genocide scholar at Columbia University, has used Hannah Arendt\u2019s book about the trial of a Nazi war criminal, \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,\u201d to spark discussion among her students about the Holocaust and its lingering traumas.",
      "But after Columbia\u2019s recent adoption of a new definition of antisemitism, which casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech, Hirsch fears she may face official sanction for even mentioning the landmark text by Arendt, a philosopher who criticized Israel's founding.",
      "For the first time since she started teaching five decades ago, Hirsch, the daughter of two Holocaust survivors, is now thinking of leaving the classroom altogether.",
      "\u201cA university that treats criticism of Israel as antisemitic and threatens sanctions for those who disobey is no longer a place of open inquiry,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how I can teach about genocide in that environment.\u201d",
      "Hirsch is not alone. At universities across the country, academics have raised alarm about growing efforts to define antisemitism on terms pushed by the Trump administration, often under the threat of federal funding cuts.",
      "Promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the definition lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying \u201cdouble standards\u201d to Israel, comparing the country\u2019s policies to Nazism or describing its existence as \u201ca racist endeavor.\u201d",
      "Ahead of a $220 million settlement with the Trump administration announced Wednesday, Columbia agreed to incorporate the IHRA definition and its examples into its disciplinary process. It has been endorsed in some form by Harvard, Yale and dozens of other universities.",
      "While supporters say the semantic shift is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it will further suppress pro-Palestinian speech already under attack by President Donald Trump.",
      "For Hirsch, the restrictions on drawing comparisons to the Holocaust and questioning Israel\u2019s founding amount to \u201cclear censorship,\u201d which she fears will chill discussions in the classroom and open her and other faculty up to spurious lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWe learn by making analogies,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNow the university is saying that\u2019s off-limits. How can you have a university course where ideas are not up for discussion or interpretation?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Columbia didn\u2019t respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "When he first drafted the IHRA definition of antisemitism two decades ago, Kenneth Stern said he \u201cnever imagined it would one day serve as a hate speech code.\u201d",
      "At the time, Stern was working as the lead antisemitism expert at the American Jewish Committee. The definition and its examples were meant to serve as a broad framework to help European countries track bias against Jews, he said.",
      "In recent years, Stern has spoken forcefully against what he sees as its \u201cweaponization\u201d against pro-Palestinian activists, including anti-Zionist Jews.",
      "\u201cPeople who believe they\u2019re combating hate are seduced by simple solutions to complicated issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when used in this context, it\u2019s really actually harming our ability to think about antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Stern said he delivered that warning to Columbia\u2019s leaders last fall after being invited to address them by Claire Shipman, then a co-chair of the board of trustees and the university\u2019s current interim president.",

But in March, shortly after the Trump administration said it would withhold $400 million in federal funding to Columbia over concerns about antisemitism, the university announced it would adopt the IHRA definition for \u201ctraining and educational\u201d purposes.",
      "Then last week, days before announcing a deal with the Trump administration to restore that funding, Shipman said the university would extend the IHRA definition for disciplinary purposes, deploying its examples when assessing \u201cdiscriminatory intent.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe formal incorporation of this definition will strengthen our response to and our community\u2019s understanding of modern antisemitism,\u201d Shipman wrote.",
      "Stern, who now serves as director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, called the move \u201cappalling,\" predicting it would spur a new wave of litigation against the university while further curtailing pro-Palestinian speech.",
      "Already, the university\u2019s disciplinary body has faced backlash for investigating students who criticized Israel in op-eds and other venues, often at the behest of pro-Israel groups.",
      "\u201cWith this new edict on IHRA, you\u2019re going to have more outside groups looking at what professors are teaching, what\u2019s in the syllabus, filing complaints and applying public pressure to get people fired,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will undoubtedly harm the university.\u201d",
      "Beyond adopting the IHRA definition, Columbia has also agreed to place its Middle East studies department under new supervision, overhaul its rules for protests and coordinate antisemitism trainings with groups like the Anti-Defamation League.",

      "He dismissed faculty concerns about the IHRA definition, which he said would \u201cprovide clarity, transparency and standardization\u201d to the university\u2019s effort to root out antisemitism.",
      "\u201cThere are undoubtedly some Columbia professors who will feel they cannot continue teaching under the new regime,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cTo the extent that they self-terminate, it may be sad for them personally, but it may not be so bad for the students at Columbia University.\u201d",
      "But Hirsch, the Columbia professor, said she was committed to continuing her long-standing study of genocides and their aftermath.",
      "Part of that work, she said, will involve talking to students about Israel\u2019s \"ongoing ethnic cleansing and genocide\u201d in Gaza, where more than 58,000 Palestinians have died, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "\u201cWith this capitulation to Trump, it may now be impossible to do that inside Columbia,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll continue my work outside the university\u2019s gates.\u201d",

      "The president's order might be aimed at liberal cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, which Trump views as too lax about conditions on their streets. But many of the concepts have already been proposed or tested in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic mayors have worked for years to get people off the streets and into treatment.",

      "A Virginia judge has denied prosecutors\u2019 motion to have an interview of a man's child be used as evidence in his trial in a double-killing case",
      "FAIRFAX, Va. -- A northern Virginia circuit judge ruled on Friday that prosecutors' case against an IRS agent charged with killing his wife and another man cannot include a recorded interview from the defendant's young daughter.",
      "Fairfax Circuit Court Chief Judge Penney Azcarate on Friday denied prosecutors\u2019 motion on the admissibility of the young child's conversation with a forensic interviewer about what she believed was happening the morning her mother was killed at her home. That child's father, Brendan Banfield, was later charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 deaths of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joe Ryan, a man who was invited to the house that day.",
      "Deputy Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Eric Clingan argued that the child's interview should be admissible evidence at trial because she is a victim of her father's alleged killing. The killings occurred while the child was in the Banfields' basement, authorities have said. In December, Banfield was indicted with child abuse and felony child cruelty in connection with the case.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an act of abuse against her by virtue of what her father did that morning,\u201d Clingan said in court.",
      "Meanwhile, John F. Carroll, who represents the father, argued in court that Banfield did not consent for his child to be interviewed by authorities at the police's headquarters.",
      "Azcarate sided with the defense, citing a statute that a child's interview would be admissible only if the child was being directly victimized by the parent. She acknowledged authorities later pressed child abuse-related charges, but she said those indictments were not the basis for officials\u2019 interview of Banfield\u2019s daughter that day.",
      "\u201cThe interview doesn't fall within the statute,\u201d Azcarate said.",
      "The evidentiary hearing is one of a series of developments in the officials\u2019 multifaceted investigation and prosecution of Christine Banfield and Ryan\u2019s killings.",
      "Carroll also moved on Friday for the court to rescind Banfield's indictment and remove Clingan, the lead prosecutor, from the case. In his arguments, Carroll argued that Clingan guided Banfield\u2019s co-defendant in an interview, though Azcarate denied both motions.",
      "That co-defendant, Juliana Peres Magalh\u00e3es, was originally arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the case. At the time of the killings, Magalh\u00e3es and Banfield informed authorities that they walked in on Ryan attacking Christine Banfield and both shot him with different weapons, attorneys have said in court.",
      "But last year, Magalh\u00e3es pleaded guilty to manslaughter in what prosecutors have long described as a scheme led by Banfield and the au pair to frame Ryan in the stabbing of Christine Banfield.",
      "Ahead of her plea, Magalh\u00e3es provided a proffer to officials and was interviewed by Clingan, attorneys have stated in court.",

She also corroborated the theory that Magalh\u00e3es, who began working for the family in 2021, and Brendan Banfield had a romantic relationship that began before the killings, and that she helped the husband in his conspiracy to kill his wife.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so upset and heartbroken for doing this to Brendan,\u201d the au pair wrote to her mother from the Fairfax County jail last October in a message, which has since been entered into court evidence. \u201cI love him and he loves me too, I have no doubts. But it\u2019s the right thing to do. For you. I want to be with you again.\u201d",
      "Despite her proffer, a divide appears evident among officials over the catfishing theory. Brendan Miller, a digital forensic examiner with the police department, testified earlier this month that his analysis of forensic evidence also suggested Christine Banfield was seeking to have an affair with Ryan.",
      "Miller testified that his analysis was based on multiple devices, and he concluded that Christine Banfield had connected with Ryan through a social networking platform for people interested in sexual fetishes and matched her with Ryan.",
      "His findings diverged from a theory held by other officials in the department that the messages Ryan had been receiving were actually from Brendan Banfield posing as his wife.",
      "Deputy Chief Patrick Brusch, who oversaw the department\u2019s major crimes bureau at the time, confirmed in testimony earlier this month that he said Miller would \u201cnever be doing another digital forensics case in your major crimes bureau\u201d after he analyzed the evidence.",
      "Carroll, Banfield's attorney, argued in court that officials were not adhering to proper investigative guidelines when building their case and backing Brusch's catfishing theory without the supporting facts.",
      "In a court filing, Carroll wrote that Brusch resigned from the department after the hearing in which he had testified.",
      "He wrote in another motion that \u201cthere is a willfulness in the lack of recognition of the science,\u201d adding: \u201cThe digital forensics are facts, and the Commonwealth chooses to ignore and disregard those facts.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 20:40:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In the late 1940s, the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of an exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 The central question in 1947, as the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communist influence in Hollywood, was: \"Are you a member of the Communist Party?\"",
      "Chaired by Republican Rep. John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey, the committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",
      "\"I think it had an enormous effect,\" Anne Lessy, assistant curator of history exhibitions for the historical society, told CBS News of the impact of the blacklist. \"If you wanted to be a part of the film industry, you essentially forfeited your privacy and your right to your own political ideas and affiliations.\"",
      "Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, spent 10 months in prison. His daughter, Mitzi, was 5 years old at the time. Her drawings and letters to him are on display in the exhibit, as well as testimony from those who named suspected Communists.",
      "\"In an effort to save themselves, their careers and their reputations, many, you know, creatives felt compelled to name names, which is what the committee wanted,\" Lessy said.",
      "Even Walt Disney famously testified before the committee.",
      "\"Walt Disney very much objected to labor organizing that had taken place in his studios and blamed it on Communist infiltration,\" Lessy said. \"And then you also have Ronald Reagan, who at the time, was president of the Screen Actors Guild. While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "summary": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:18:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",

      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",

      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches.

He earned a bachelor's degree from the Eastman School of Music - where he would eventually return as director of the school's jazz ensemble - and left home to play with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.",

      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",

Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner drowned Sunday afternoon in Cocles de Lim\u00f3n, on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. He appeared to have been pulled out to sea by a current.",
      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",
      "He said they had last spoken about three months ago, when they chatted about Warner's successful pivot to music. \"He was very proud of what he had done,\" Cosby said.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",

      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",

      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",

The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",

      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",

The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "President Trump on Friday said he's considering issuing rebate checks for Americans based on the billions in new tariff revenue collected by his administration.",
      "\"We're thinking about a little rebate. But the big thing we want to do is pay down debt. But we're thinking about a rebate,\" Mr. Trump said in comments to reporters before he left for a\u00a0four-day visit to Scotland.",
      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

      "Trade experts say a U.S.-EU agreement could mirror the Trump administration's pact this week with Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, Japan has committed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including for cars and certain farm products.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson said he understands President Trump's frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, but reiterated that he's uncertain about \"what the legal parameters are\" if the president fires him.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell, accusing him of not acting quickly enough to slash interest rates \u2014 the Fed has currently set a benchmark rate of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has remained all year. The president has argued that cutting borrowing costs would boost economic growth, but the central bank has worried that slashing rates could make inflation worse. Powell has also cited the uncertainty of economic impacts of Mr. Trump's tariffs as another factor. Mr. Trump has brought up the idea of firing Powell but later said it's \"highly unlikely\" he would.",
      "\"I do believe that he should reduce interest rates, and it's really too much power to be held in the hands of one person or a board,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview Wednesday. The decision to raise or lower interest rates is not Powell's alone. Eight times a year, the Federal Open Market Committee, which has 12 members, votes on monetary policy.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Powell as Fed chair during his first term, and then-President Joe Biden subsequently nominated him for a second four-year term that expires in May 2026.",
      "\"It's a rocky road for him between now and then,\" Johnson said. \"I do believe a lot of economists will say, when the economy is hot, when it's running \u2014 and ours is, and we're ramping up lots of great development \u2014 that that is not a time for you to reduce interest rates. But I think desperate times call for desperate measures.\"",
      "Johnson said lowering interest rates would help solve the housing affordability crisis.",
      "\"If you reduce the rates just a small percentage, you can solve that problem,\" he said. \"I think that would be a big thing for the economy and I think he ought to duly consider that. It would save the nation a lot of money and would give a lot more people more opportunity.\"",

      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate.

      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",

      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",

      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "\"Australia stands for open and free trade \u2014 our cattle industry has significantly benefited from this,\" Collins said in a statement.",
      "Trump administration calls it a \"major trade breakthrough\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins responded to Australia's announcement by congratulating Mr. Trump on a \"major trade breakthrough that gives greater access to U.S. beef producers selling to Australia.\"",
      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the President negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.\"",
      "Australia has allowed imports of beef grown in the U.S. since 2019, but not allowed imports from the U.S. of beef sourced from Canada or Mexico because of the disease risk.",

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",

      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots.

    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",

      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change.

      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:23:57 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

    "summary": "Experts say they're bewildered by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's decision to interview Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met for a second day with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, without offering more than a broad rationale for his hours of questioning. Multiple former federal prosecutors told CBS News they were bewildered by his decision to launch into such talks and described the unfolding events as both unorthodox and concerning.",
      "\"She's somebody who has been sentenced by a court to 20 years in prison, and she is likely also desperate to get out from under that sentence,\" said Elizabeth Oyer, a former Justice Department pardon attorney and federal public defender. \"It's hard to really believe that the Justice Department would rely on anything that she might have to say.\"",
      "Oyer suggested that Maxwell was speaking with Blanche \"in the hope that she might be able to cut a deal that will benefit her, and that raises fundamental questions about the credibility of any information she could possibly provide.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense lawyer, David Markus, said after the meeting that she answered everything asked of her \"and she didn't hold anything back.\"",
      "Asked whether Maxwell is seeking a pardon, Markus said, \"We haven't spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet,\" adding, \"We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.\"",
      "\"It's unprecedented for the deputy attorney general to be directly involved in interviewing someone who's been convicted of a crime and may be interested in cooperating to get leniency,\" one former senior Justice Department official told CBS News on the condition he not be identified. \"It strikes me simply as an effort to address a political concern, which is not what the Justice Department does.\"",
      "Blanche is a senior Justice Department official who previously served as a personal attorney to President Trump. He is also a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He announced his decision to travel to Florida to meet with Maxwell after days of public attention swirled around the administration's mixed messaging about the possible release of files on Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in the trafficking ring.",
      "Several aspects of the Blanche decision appear to break with longstanding Justice Department practices. Among the most concerning, former officials said, is having Blanche conduct the interviews, rather than the line prosecutors who helped win a conviction in the Maxwell case, and who are continuing to combat her efforts to appeal the outcome.",
      "Adding to the complication is that the prosecutor who led the Maxwell case, Maurene Comey, was fired by the Trump administration a week ago.",
      "One former prosecutor said a key reason for having a line prosecutor handle such an interview is their comprehensive knowledge of both Maxwell and the facts of the case against her. Otherwise, this attorney said, it could be very hard to determine whether Maxwell is being truthful \u2014 especially since there were already past questions about her willingness to be fully candid about the misconduct that led to her arrest, and Epstein's.",
      "\"The best way to determine that is to ask questions you already know the answers to,\" the former prosecutor said. \"Todd Blanche is in no position to assess the truth if he doesn't know all the facts.\"",
      "Because Blanche's meetings were occurring behind closed doors, it is unclear if he was accompanied by other Justice Department officials or FBI agents.",
      "The Justice Department has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News that meetings of this nature almost always include an FBI agent who can memorialize the discussion in formal interview notes that could later have evidentiary value, if needed.",
      "\"If Blanche was meeting with Maxwell alone, that's obscene malpractice,\" another former federal prosecutor, who had decades of experience, told CBS News. \"He can't testify and become a witness, nor can he write a report of their meeting.\"",
      "Prosecutors are not permitted to write up interview reports and are not sworn law enforcement officers with training to document an interview of this kind.",
      "\"It would be a mess,\" the former official said. \"The first rule of a meeting with a witness is to have an agent present.\"",
      "As another former prosecutor put it: \"This is not typical.\"",
      "\"It's not the most effective way\" to work if the goal is to gather additional evidence or identify potential targets for future prosecution, this person said.",
      "Mr. Trump has never been accused of misconduct in connection with Epstein's criminal activity, and he has consistently said he cut ties with Epstein before Epstein's first arrest in 2006 for his conduct with underage girls.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to push past the crush of attention on the topic, even referring to it as \"the Jeffrey Epstein hoax.\"",
      "Blanche explained his decision to meet with Maxwell by saying he would \"pursue justice wherever the facts may lead.\"",
      "\"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche said.",
      "Like Oyer, many former federal prosecutors saw the meeting as a political move intended to dampen growing mistrust about the decision not to make public the files connected with Epstein's case. Multiple former prosecutors spoke with CBS News about the matter, but asked not to be identified because they feared retribution against them or their current employers.",

      "But nothing in Texas state law bars legislators from redrawing lines in between censuses, and President Trump has asked Lone Star State Republicans to use their complete control of government to rearrange congressional district boundaries in hopes of winning up to five more seats across the state in next year's elections.

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin joined the panel of appellate judges and a federal judge in New Hampshire in blocking the Trump administration's restrictions on birthright citizenship, finding a nationwide injunction on the executive order remains in place, The Associated Press reported.",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday announced deportation flights had begun to take off from the so-called Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention facility that his administration set up in the Everglades, saying \"hundreds\" of detainees held at the site had been processed for deportation.",
      "DeSantis, a Republican who has sought to vocally highlight his state's efforts to aid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, said several hundred individuals in line for deportation for alleged immigration offenses had been relocated from the Alligator Alcatraz site to other states or straight to their home countries.",
      "\"The whole purpose is to make this be a place that can facilitate increased frequency and numbers of deportations of illegal aliens,\" DeSantis said during a press conference at Alligator Alcatraz, noting the site has a runway that can accommodate deportation planes.",
      "Florida state officials have overseen the construction of the Everglades facility and the detention of individuals there under a cooperation agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the deportation process is still overseen by federal officials. During the same event Friday, Garrett Ripa, a top ICE official in Florida, confirmed \"two or three\" deportation flights had taken off from Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "DeSantis said the cadence of flights would increase, citing the tens of billions of dollars Congress recently gave the Trump administration for immigration enforcement and Florida's expanding efforts to leverage state resources and manpower to help federal officials identify, arrest and detain immigrants living illegally in the Sunshine State.",
      "The governor predicted the Justice Department would \"very soon\" approve a plan for Florida National Guard lawyers, known as judge advocates, to gain the powers of federal immigration judges and adjudicate the cases of those detained at Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "Standing next to DeSantis, Larry Keefe, the executive director of Florida's Board of Immigration Enforcement, warned those in the U.S. illegally that there would be a \"surge\" in immigration arrests in the state, saying local law enforcement officials have roughly doubled their capacity to arrest immigrants suspected of violating federal immigration laws.",
      "Keefe said 1,800 Florida troopers deputized as federal immigration agents had been conducting arrests throughout the state. But he added that in the past few days, the Trump administration has issued \"credentials\" to an additional 1,200 sheriff's deputies and 650 state agents to bolster Florida's efforts to assist the federal government's mass deportation campaign.",
      "Under arrangements with ICE known as 287(g) agreements, local and state officials can enforce federal immigration laws to varying degrees that can include the arresting and detaining those in the U.S. unlawfully. Florida law requires state law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said Alligator Alcatraz can currently accommodate 2,000 detainees, but that the state is working to expand capacity at the facility to be able to hold 4,000 individuals there.",
      "Guthrie defended conditions at the tent facility, and said state officials were prepared for any storm-related issues during hurricane season. Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have reported poor and unsanitary conditions, including food with maggots, not being able to shower regularly and not having access to lawyers, CBS News Miami has reported.",
      "Asked about the hurricane concerns, DeSantis said there's no place in Florida \"totally immune\" from storms, adding that contingency plans were in place.",

      "Trade experts say a U.S.-EU agreement could mirror the Trump administration's pact this week with Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports.

    "summary": "The federal district court in New Jersey appointed Alina Habba's deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday withdrew the nomination of Alina Habba, his former defense lawyer, to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, a Justice Department official confirmed, which clears the way for her to serve as the U.S. attorney in the state in an acting capacity.",
      "Mr. Trump's move came after a federal district court set off a leadership scramble in the U.S. attorney's office when it declined to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and instead installed Desiree Leigh Grace as the state's top federal prosecutor.",
      "Grace, who was Habba's deputy, was selected by the judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey to serve as the U.S. attorney for the state as Habba's 120-day term in the post wound down. But shortly after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Grace had been removed as first assistant U.S. attorney, and she excoriated the judges for tapping Grace, instead of letting Habba stay in the role.",
      "\"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges \u2014 especially when they threaten the president's core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote on social media.",
      "The attorney general's post raised questions about who would be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey as the 120-day clock on Habba's interim term expires. A court order signed by Chief Judge Renee Bumb said Grace's appointment was effective Tuesday or \"upon the expiration of 120 days after\" Habba's appointment by Bondi.",
      "But Habba said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X, \"I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey\" and indicated she would fight for the job. The Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Trump pulled Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney, which avoids a provision of federal law that restricts\u00a0a person\u00a0from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. That law limits her time as acting U.S. attorney to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on March 24 that he had tapped Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which would put the expiration of her term at July 22. But Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, has said her tenure as interim U.S. attorney ends Friday.",
      "Habba has the Justice Department leaders behind her, and they've accused New Jersey judges of playing politics with their decision not to keep Habba in the post.",
      "Mr. Trump had nominated Habba for the role of U.S. attorney, but New Jersey's two home-state senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, oppose her.",
      "\"President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Habba was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in several civil cases brought against him in New York, and she joined the White House as a counselor to the president after Mr. Trump won a second term. The president announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in her home state of New Jersey. Federal law limited her time as interim U.S. attorney to 120 days.",
      "Habba deserves the job, according to Armen Morian, who worked alongside Habba in a 2023 New York civil case in which Mr. Trump, his company and top executives were found liable for fraud.",
      "\"I think she's eminently qualified to be U.S. attorney, and I think she's doing a fine job of it,\" Morian said.",
      "Morian hit back at Habba's critics who questioned her suitability for the job, having never previously been a prosecutor.",
      "\"President Trump is a very unconventional figure, and he forces us, I think, to reconsider a lot of the assumptions we make. Sometimes it's very useful to put somebody into an office who has shown to you that she has sufficient judgment and will do well in the position,\" Morian said.",
      "But the state's two senators, Booker and Kim, opposed her nomination. Under the Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy, a nomination for U.S. attorney or to a federal district court will not move forward unless both home-state senators return positive blue slips.",
      "With the 120-day deadline on Habba's term approaching, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey invoked their power under federal law and voted to replace Habba with Grace, her deputy.",
      "Can judges even appoint the U.S. attorney?",
      "Yes. A federal statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies specifies that if the attorney general's appointment of a U.S. attorney expires after 120 days, the district court can name a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "The law requires an order of appointment by the court to be filed with the clerk of the court.",
      "\"The reason why you have this 120-day deadline followed by judicial appointments was so that the president is incentivized to get someone confirmed because after 120 days, you lose the authority within the executive branch to control who is the U.S. attorney,\" Thomas Barry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "While rare, courts have exercised this power before.",
      "The judges on the U.S. district court in New Mexico selected Gregory Fouratt to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the state in January 2008, and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, the district court in New Jersey appointed Craig Carpenito the state's U.S. attorney as his 120-day term was set to run out. Also that year, the U.S. district court in Manhattan tapped Geoffrey Berman to serve as the district's top federal prosecutor.",
      "But Berman's exit in June 2020 was rocked by confusion when then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that Berman would be \"stepping down.\" Berman, however, said he had not resigned and had no intention of doing so. Barr then informed Berman that Mr. Trump had removed him from the post.",
      "Does Bondi have the power to remove a court-appointed U.S. attorney?",
      "It doesn't seem so. In a 1979 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is not binding, then-Assistant Attorney General John Harmon explained that \"the president is responsible for the conduct of a U.S. Attorney's Office and therefore must have the power to remove one he believes is an unsuitable incumbent, regardless of who appointed him.\"",
      "Harmon also said that when it comes to whether the attorney general has the authority to terminate a court-appointed U.S. attorney, \"We answer this questions [sic] in the negative.\" He said federal law regarding the removal of U.S. attorneys constitutes \"the specific exercise of legislative power under Article II, section 2, clause 2, vesting in the president the power of removing a court-appointed U.S. attorney.\"",
      "In a social media post, Blanche wrote that Grace had been ousted \"pursuant to the president's authority.\"",
      "\"This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive,\" he wrote.",
      "Berry said there have been very few, if any, judicial decisions, about the removal of interim U.S. attorneys, especially if the attorney general disagrees with the court's appointment.",
      "Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney",
      "Until Thursday \u2014 because Mr. Trump had nominated her to serve as New Jersey's chief federal prosecutor \u2014 Habba did not appear to be eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the state.",
      "The situation involving Habba and the U.S. attorney position in New Jersey potentially involved the interactions of two different federal laws: the statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies, which gives district courts the power to name someone to that role temporarily; and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 27-year-old law that limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump used the law, also known as the Vacancies Act, during his first term to install a number of \"acting\" leaders across the executive branch.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Vacancies Act sets out three categories of federal workers who can move into a position covered by the law: the \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office; another administration official who has been confirmed by the Senate; and an agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy occurred and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale.",
      "Grace, who the New Jersey judges selected to succeed Habba, was the first assistant.",
      "But the law prohibits a person from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. The upper chamber received Habba's nomination from Mr. Trump on June 30. His withdrawal of her nomination now enables Habba to serve as acting U.S. attorney, as she resigned from the interim post \u2014 the role the district judges declined to keep her in \u2014 and was then appointed first assistant U.S. attorney by Bondi. Habba then could become acting U.S. attorney because the position is unfilled.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to have used the Vacancies Act to put at least one acting attorney general in place \u2014 John Sarcone who is currently leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albany.",
      "Bondi announced in early March that Sarcone had been appointed the interim top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of New York, but earlier this month, the U.S. district court there declined to tap him for U.S. attorney. Bondi instead named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" which effectively gives him the power of a U.S. attorney. Sarcone was named first assistant U.S. attorney as well, effectively leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "Berry said there is a loophole in the Vacancies Act that allows a lower-ranking official who does not require Senate confirmation to perform the duties of a senior leader when that role is vacant, which could be used to Habba's benefit.",
      "\"Subdelegation is so easy to do throughout the executive branch,\" he said. \"This exact same maneuver is done all the time for all sorts of offices.\"",
      "What happens to Grace?",
      "In a post Wednesday on LinkedIn, Grace indicated she is no longer the No. 2 in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, but signaled she was prepared to follow the judges' order that names her the interim U.S. attorney, even though Bondi fired her from her post as the first assistant.",
      "\"It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I'm prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,\" Grace wrote.",
      "The dozens of comments beneath Grace's LinkedIn post highlight her deep ties in the state, and high regard among New Jersey law enforcement.",
      "Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O'Hara, who previously was Newark, New Jersey's Safety Director, congratulated Grace.",
      "\"Desiree Grace Anyone who knows you knows the heart, integrity, and commitment you bring to the job. You have definitely made a difference,\" O'Hara wrote.",

      "San Diego \u2014 The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement outlining specific steps and a new timetable to clean up the longstanding problem of the Tijuana River pouring sewage across the border and polluting California beaches, officials from both countries announced Thursday.",
      "Billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana have polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water. That's despite multiple efforts and millions of dollars that have been poured into addressing the problem over decades, including under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a great commitment by the two countries to strengthen cooperation,\" Mexico's Environmental Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena said Thursday after meeting with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in Mexico City for the signing of the memorandum of understanding.",
      "The accord comes three months after Zeldin flew to San Diego to meet with Mexican officials and visit the border.",
      "\"I smelled what a lot of residents in the community lived through and have to deal with,\" he said Thursday. \"I saw the degradation of the Tijuana River valley. I heard about the beaches that were closed. I met with the Navy Seals, who have had their training impacted. It was a powerful visit all around for me.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is proud to deliver this massive environmental and national security win for Americans in the San Diego area who have been living with this disgusting raw sewage flowing into their communities for far too long,\" Zeldin said, according to CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.",
      "Under the agreement, Mexico will complete its allocation of $93 million toward infrastructure projects, including adhering to a specific schedule for priority projects spanning through 2027.",
      "The 120-mile-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana's wastewater treatment plants have aged, its population and industry \u2014 including the manufacturing plants, known as maquiladoras that make U.S. goods \u2014 have boomed. At the same time, there has been an increase in the amount of toxins that have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who don't even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020, more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin has said.",
      "Zeldin said this agreement factors in \"population growth, operation and maintenance costs, and other variables that would make this solution durable and long term.\"",
      "He praised the new administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October, for its willingness to address the issue.",
      "Sheinbaum said earlier Thursday that her government would expand a wastewater treatment plant that would reduce the contamination reaching the coast.",
      "\"There are other actions that were signed that we have to complete, that we're going to get done in the next year for the entire Tijuana sanitation system, for the entire metropolitan Tijuana area,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said the United States also has to make investments in the binational problem.",
      "Referring to another agreement to send more water to the U.S. to reduce Mexico's water debt in the Rio Grande, Sheinbaum said the Tijuana River agreement \"is a good example of how when our technical teams sit down, they can resolve a problem that seemed unsolvable.\"",
      "The U.S. has agreed to complete the expansion of the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant next month. The agreement also stipulates that Mexico this year divert 10 million gallons per day of treated sewage away from the shore.",

      "\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \"If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\"",
      "The New York Immigration Coalition called the lawsuit frivolous.",
      "\"Sanctuary policies simply tell all New Yorkers, regardless of your immigration status, that if you are a victim of a crime or witness a crime, feel free to go to law enforcement,\" said Murad Awawdeh, the organization's president and CEO. \"Localities as well as states have the right to create policies and laws that keep their constituencies safe, and that's what our sanctuary policies do.\"",

The sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement. Why is that? Because they won't let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail. They're going to release a public safety threat back in the community. Now, I've got to send the whole team to go find that person. So you know, we're going to find the bad guy whether they help us or not,\" Homan said.",
      "City Hall responded with the following statement:",

Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council -- but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to re-examine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer.

    "summary": "President Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, keeping up the intense pressure he's been putting on Fed chair Jerome Powell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "summary": "Three fired Justice Department officials filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday challenging their terminations from the agency earlier this summer",
    "story": [
      "Three fired Justice Department officials filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, after they were part of a wave of terminations from the agency earlier this summer.",
      "The plaintiffs in Thursday's suit include Michael Gordon, a longtime federal prosecutor who also handled January 6 cases. He was fired last month while handling a high-level fraud case against a Florida man accused of fleecing children with special needs out of millions of dollars. The lawsuit says the firing \"came as a particular shock\" to Gordon because he was picked to help lead that case, and he was \"personally congratulated\" by officials.",
      "Also joining the suit: Joseph Tirrell, the department's former top ethics official, and Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist who oversaw press releases about Jan. 6 cases and helped maintain the content of an online Justice Department database on Capital siege cases.",
      "In their lawsuit, the three officials say they were told of their firings in one-page memos signed by Bondi that didn't offer any specific reason for the termination. The memos cited Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which lays out the powers of the president.",
      "The suit argues Bondi and the Justice Department did not follow the normal procedures that govern how and when civil servants can be fired. They ask a judge to order the Trump administration to \"immediately reinstate\" them as Justice Department employees, and award back pay as needed.",
      "\"The Attorney General does not have absolute authority to simply remove DOJ employees. Specifically, there are crucial guardrails that protect employees from arbitrary or unlawful termination,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "On Tirell's termination, the suit also says he is owed protections as a member of the Senior Executive Service \u2014 a category of senior-level government employees who aren't appointed by the president \u2014 and as a Navy veteran.",
      "\"Specifically, it is a Prohibited Personnel Practice to 'knowingly take, recommend, or approve any personnel action if the taking of such action would violate a veterans' preference requirement,'\" the suit read, referring to federal rules that give former members of the military certain preferences in government jobs.",
      "Normally, the suit says, the plaintiffs would be able to go to a federal agency called the Merit Systems Protection Board to appeal their firings. But the MSPB has been hobbled by President Trump's decision to fire a board member, making any filing there \"futile,\" the plaintiffs say.",
      "Dozens of Justice Department staffers have been fired, CBS News has previously reported. The firings include prosecutors and officials who worked on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, as well as people linked to the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Within weeks of Mr. Trump's inauguration, top officials directed the FBI to put together a list of agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases \u2014 a sweeping dragnet since the Capitol riot investigation was the largest in Justice Department history, ensnaring over 1,000 defendants. Meanwhile, Bondi set up a \"weaponization working group\" tasked with reviewing the two federal criminal prosecutions of Mr. Trump.",
      "After her firing, Hartman blasted the Justice Department in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"There used to be a line, used to be a very distinct separation between the White House and the Department of Justice, because one should not interfere with the work of the other,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"That line is very definitely gone.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Scott MacFarlane is CBS News' Justice correspondent. He has covered Washington for two decades, earning 20 Emmy and Edward R. Murrow awards. His reporting has resulted directly in the passage of five new laws."

    "summary": "The CIA chief \"strongly supports\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's release of documents on Russian activity in 2016 \u2014 which sparked concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods.",
    "story": [
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"strongly supports the public release\" this week of highly sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to a CIA spokesperson, who said Ratcliffe \"initiated\" the declassification process after he took the helm at the agency this year.",
      "Gabbard's office publicly released a report drafted in 2017 by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Russian activity during the 2016 election, sparking concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods. She said Wednesday that the document contained additional evidence that Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" a narrative about Russia's actions that was designed to undercut President Trump.",
      "Gabbard also declassified a swath of documents related to the 2016 election last Friday.",
      "\"CIA Director Ratcliffe strongly supports the public release of HPSCI's report, which was the result of a process initiated by CIA and led by DNI Gabbard,\" the CIA spokesperson said, using an abbreviation for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "\"This effort reflects Director Ratcliffe's continued commitment to elevating the truth and bringing transparency to the American people and would not have been possible without his directive to return it to the committee,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The House report, which the committee's Republican staff finalized in December 2017 but updated through 2020, was so highly classified that it was stored at CIA headquarters before Ratcliffe sent it back to the House panel and ultimately toward public release, CBS News has learned.",
      "The committee made it available to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, according to an ODNI official with knowledge of the declassification process. Gabbard would normally have been required to consult with the intelligence agencies that had contributed sensitive information to the report before declassifying it, but Mr. Trump \u2014 who made the decision to declassify the document with relatively few redactions \u2014 was not under the same obligations, the official said.",
      "The report was written in large part by then-committee staffer Kash Patel, now the FBI director, according to one current and one former official. It contained discussions about raw intelligence from a CIA source the agency had recruited in Russia, and questioned whether analysts had sufficiently taken into account the source's motivations, proximity to Putin or potential bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The CIA source's information helped inform the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, which concluded in part that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government aspired to help then-candidate Donald Trump's election chances by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The U.S. exfiltrated a CIA asset from Russia in 2017, CBS News previously confirmed.",
      "That judgment within the ICA has vexed Mr. Trump for years and has been a key focus of Gabbard's recent declassifications.",
      "Gabbard has claimed the documents released by her office reveal a \"treasonous conspiracy\" by Obama-era officials to undermine Mr. Trump during his first term by alleging Russian efforts to help him win in 2016. Gabbard says she has forwarded the records to the Justice Department as part of a criminal referral.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush called Gabbard's accusations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\" earlier this week.",
      "The ICA's judgement about Russian actions in 2016 was also the focus of a recent CIA internal review under Ratcliffe. Released earlier this month, that review contained far fewer of the sensitive details included in the House Republicans' report and said the judgment on Putin's preference for Trump should have been issued with moderate rather than high confidence. But it said it did not dispute the \"quality and credibility\" of the information.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, called the release of the House committee's report by Gabbard \"desperate and irresponsible.\" He said it put highly sensitive sources at risk and could disincentivize potential spies from working for the U.S. government.",
      "\"Tell me how you're going to recruit somebody to, in one of our adversarial nations, maybe work with us, if that information is carelessly thrown around,\" Warner said to reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, who previously served on the House Intelligence Committee as a congressman from Texas, has said one of his primary objectives as CIA director would be to reinvigorate intelligence collection from human sources. Current and former national security officials have said intelligence provided by human sources, known as HUMINT, has dropped off in recent years, as surveillance technologies have become more sophisticated and ubiquitous.",
      "Human sources \u2014 especially those with proximity to world leaders in adversarial countries like Russia, China and North Korea \u2014 are especially prized and especially rare, given how risky, if not life-threatening, it can be for them to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency. Information provided by human sources typically remains classified for decades, often up to 75 years, according to government classification rules.",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Ratcliffe said the recruitment of human spies by the CIA is \"not where it needs to be.\"",
      "\"I do want to spend time looking at that,\" he said.",
      "The CIA has recently released recruitment videos in multiple languages with the aim of enticing potential human sources in Iran, China and Russia to come forward.",

Among them is Juan Carlos, an immigrant from Mexico who had lived in the U.S. for 19 years. On June 24, his construction crew stopped at a Home Depot in the City of Industry, California \u2014 near Los Angeles \u2014 to pick up supplies when he was cornered by federal immigration agents.",
      "\"As soon as I saw them, I tried to run,\" said Juan Carlos, who lived in the U.S. for 19 years. His arrest was captured on cell phone video.",
      "He says he spent two weeks in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention before agreeing to sign deportation paperwork.",
      "\"Los Angeles gave me many things,\" Juan Carlos told CBS News. \"It gave me opportunities. It gave me another kind of life\u2026I felt like I was home. But everything happens for a reason.\"",
      "Video of Juan Carlos' arrest was recorded and posted online by a young woman named Audree. She told CBS News she was shocked by the incident, but hoped posting the video would help his family.",
      "\"What really got to me was I'm sure they had a gut feeling, maybe not to go out that day, but they needed the money,\" she said.",
      "CBS News has spoken to several undocumented immigrants who were arrested by ICE agents, and then after being deported, ended up in a country that they are now unfamiliar with.",
      "In January, the Mexican government announced they had set up shelters along the border with the U.S. preparing for a massive wave of deportees. One of the facilities, Flamingo's, used to be an event space. Pricila Rivas is a binational deportee coordinator for Al Otro Lado, the only nonprofit allowed into the Flamingo's facility.",
      "Rivas says the facility has a capacity of 3,000, but has only held about 100 people at a time.",
      "\"It's like a processing station where folks are able to obtain a copy of their birth certificate and basic identity documents,\" Rivas explained.",

      "\"There's flights going to Tapachula, to the southern border of Mexico,\" Rivas said. \"So I mean, what happens to the folks that are being deported to other places.\"",
      "Even as ICE agents get more aggressive with their tactics, the mass deportations President Trump promised haven't fully materialized.",
      "According to numbers obtained by CBS News this week, ICE is on track to record more than 300,000 removals in President Trump's first year back in office, which would be the highest tally since the Obama administration. However, that number is still well below the one million annual deportations which the Trump administration has targeted. The Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "One of those who chose to self-deport is Uliser, an immigrant from Cuba. At the age of 15, he says he fatally shot someone and spent the next 19 years in a U.S. prison before being released in 2024. He was issued a deportation order shortly after, and had been attending immigration check-ins regularly. But as immigration enforcement ramped up in the U.S., he worried he might be detained. And since Cuba is not accepting deportees, there was a risk he'd be sent elsewhere.",
      "\"It was a high risk of me, of the United States sending me to Salvador or South Sudan,\" he says, \" it was an easy choice\u2026 letting them send me to a country where I had, no, I didn't have the choice to go to or just deciding, coming over here to Mexico where I'm gonna have better opportunities in life.\"",
      "Of the estimated 100,000 people who were deported between Jan. 1 and June 24 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 70,583 were convicted criminals, according to an ICE document obtained by CBS News earlier this month. However, the data also shows that most of the documented infractions were traffic or immigration offenses. Less than 1% had murder convictions, the documents showed.",
      "Uliser says he feels remorse when stories like his are used to admonish immigrants.",
      "\"When I was in prison, I did a lot of reflection,\" Uliser told CBS News. \"They use that excuse just to target the folks that are actually working and trying to have a better life.\"",

      "The Washington, D.C., city council chairman announced Thursday that a deal has been reached between the city and the Washington Commanders on an amended stadium agreement, despite threats earlier this week from President Trump to block any deal.",
      "The NFL team is in negotiations with the district over their plans to build a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site in D.C. 30 years after decamping to Maryland, but the proposal faces myriad challenges up ahead.",
      "Mr. Trump said on July 20 that if the Commanders \"don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.\" The team changed their name from the \"Washington Redskins\" five years ago, as the term is widely considered a racist slur against Native Americans, but Mr. Trump has recently revamped calls for a return to the old name.",
      "\"I think that everyone has been perplexed by the President's comments, and in that sense, they certainly have not been helpful. I don't know where they go. And I have actually characterized him as a distraction, in the many senses of that word,\" D.C. Council chairman Phil Mendelson said of Mr. Trump's comments at a press conference Thursday.",
      "The council is set to vote on the proposal on Aug. 1, with a second vote set for Sept. 17, according to Mendelson. Mendelson said he is \"confident that we will have the votes necessary\" to pass the agreement next week.",
      "In addition to the looming threats from the president, the D.C. Council and the Commanders also face the technical difficulties surrounding the transfer of control over the RFK Stadium property. While the stadium is located on federal land, the city was given permission by Congress in January to control the property for 99 years, which would allow for its redevelopment. The agreement reached today signals a step towards receiving approval from city councilors over the redevelopment plan, but the real test will come with the Aug. 1 vote.",
      "Regardless of the forthcoming roadblocks, the proposal seems to have widespread support, both from district politicians and residents.",
      "\"Bringing the Commanders home is about more than a stadium. It's about creating jobs, attracting revenue, and driving investment to Ward 7\u2014and it's coming at [a] time when we need it the most,\" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday.",
      "The deal, as of its latest amendments, includes $950 million in revenue benefits for D.C., and is estimated to save district taxpayers $55 million, according Mendelson.",
      "\"A lot of the reaction that we got from residents, at least, that I heard, and I think my colleagues would agree, was that the deal could be better for the district. And I mean, I heard from many people, 'I support the team. I want the team in a district, but I think it could be a better deal.' And so I think the Commanders heard that,\" Mendelson said.",
      "The negotiations will likely continue, with possible additional amendments to be made later on, but while Mendelson said \"there's still a lot that has to be worked out in terms of legal documents,\" the current deal represents the \"basic framework\" of the agreement.",
      "Mendelson, who previously raised concerns over the proposal due to its costs, said he \"[put] aside my own view\" on the deal due to support from D.C. residents and his fellow council members, and has since been satisfied with the progress.",
      "\"[T]he Commanders have been very positive, constructive in our negotiations,\" Mendelson said. \"I have no complaint.\"",

      "The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration court judges, reports that since the Trump Administration took office, more than 100 immigration\u00a0 judges have either been fired, transferred, or have taken retirement offers.",
      "According to the union, immigration judges are considered Justice Department employees, and therefore do not have lifetime appointments like federal judges in the judicial branch.",

      "In defending its immigration crackdown, the White House has repeatedly argued that undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. And in May, the Trump administration began an effort to halt the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to fast-track their deportation process, government officials and attorneys told CBS News at the time. Espinoza counters that the court system exists to ensure the law is followed, and attempts to circumvent it could prove to be a slippery slope.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Ghislaine Maxwell at the U.S. attorney's office in Tallahassee on Thursday to discuss convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "\"And she answered every one of them. She never did say, 'I'm not going to answer,' never declined,\" he said. \"This is the first time that the government has asked questions, so we were thankful that the deputy attorney general came and asked her questions. It's the first time the government did it. So it was a good day.\"",
      "In a post Thursday night on X, Blanche wrote that he met with Maxwell and \"will continue my interview of her tomorrow. The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence at a low-security federal correctional institute in Tallahassee. She was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "Blanche's meeting comes after he said earlier this week that he planned to meet with Maxwell \"in the coming days.\"",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media Tuesday. He said he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote. Markus then confirmed that Maxwell's legal team was in discussions with the government.",
      "Pressure has been building on President Trump and his administration over Epstein's case after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed he died by suicide in 2019, shortly after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The memo also concluded that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they would not release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "But the Trump administration's conclusions rankled some of his allies, who were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there is nothing left to divulge.",
      "Some of the administration's top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, had suggested before Mr. Trump returned to the White House that Democrats were hiding information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "In an effort to quell the backlash, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York who handled Epstein and Maxwell's cases to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving the two.",
      "Earlier this week, judges overseeing the requests each ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its efforts to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "It will be up to the judges to decide whether the grand jury material can be disclosed. If they grant the requests, the information will likely be heavily redacted, and it is likely to be weeks or months before the transcripts are unsealed.",
      "In addition to facing backlash from some of his allies, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pushed to make material related to Epstein public.",
      "A House panel voted Wednesday to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the federal probe into Epstein. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition next month at the federal detention center in Tallahassee.",
      "Mr. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said in 2019, following Epstein's arrest, that they hadn't spoken in 15 years.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter. The president has denied that he wrote the letter, calling it \"fake,\" and sued the Journal and its owners for defamation. He is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "The Journal reported Wednesday that when Justice Department officials reviewed documents related to Epstein earlier this year, they learned Mr. Trump's name appeared multiple times. Bondi and her deputy told the president at a White House meeting in May that his name was in the so-called Epstein files, as were those of other public figures, according to the Journal. Mr. Trump being mentioned does not mean he committed any wrongdoing.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said in response to the Journal's report that \"The fact is that The President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\"",

      "\"Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,\" the text of the order said. \"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.\"",
      "The executive order the president also asks Bondi to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation to prioritize federal grants for states and cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering,\" the White House said. The order was first reported by USA Today.",
      "\"President Trump is delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again and end homelessness across America,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, the Trump administration will ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need.\"",
      "In March, Mr. Trump called for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to \"clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City, specifically including the ones outside of the State Department, and near the White House.\" He added that if she was \"not capable of doing so, we will be forced to do it for her!\" He signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to clear all homeless encampments on federal lands.",

      "\"Forced treatment is unethical, ineffective, and illegal. People need stable housing and access to healthcare.

      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",

      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",

      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",
      "A senior Scottish police official told Britain's Sky News it would be \"inappropriate\" to ignore the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump a year ago.",
      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",

    "summary": "In a new survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends.",
    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship.

      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",

      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",

      "Sydney \u2014 Humans beat generative AI models made by Google and OpenAI at a top international mathematics competition, but the programs reached gold-level scores for the first time, and the rate at which they are improving may be cause for some human introspection.",
      "Neither of the AI models scored full marks \u2014 unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old.",
      "Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month.",
      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects.

      "The result \"achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI\" at \"the world's most prestigious math competition,\" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post.",
      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",
      "That took two to three days of computation \u2014 far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said.",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-job-postings-brookings-lightcast/",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",

      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",

    "summary": "Christopher Kennedy didn't think anything was wrong. Soon, doctors were telling him a double lung transplant was his only option.",
    "story": [
      "When Christopher Kennedy went to have an X-ray before a routine surgery, he thought he would be in and out. Then a technician spotted scarring in his lungs.",
      "Kennedy, 68 at the time, had never noticed any warning signs. He was a retired Air Force technician who exercised regularly and spent his time landscaping his backyard and training Bernese Mountain dogs to be hospital therapy animals.",
      "After several tests, a pulmonologist gave him an alarming diagnosis: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. It's a type of lung disease with no known cause where scar tissue grows in the lungs and prevents oxygen from reaching the bloodstream, according to Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association and pulmonologist at Johns Hopkins, who was not involved in Kennedy's care. The condition is progressive with a \"high mortality rate,\" Galiatsatos said.",
      "At first, Kennedy thought he could \"beat\" the disease. But as his lung function degraded, he realized that was \"baloney.\" Medications meant to slow the progressive fibrosis weren't working, and he was starting to need oxygen in his daily life. Even walking to the kitchen was leaving him winded. In 2024, Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Dr. Aman Pande confirmed Kennedy's worst fear: He had less than a year to live.",
      "\"We all wonder, as human beings, how we're going to go,\" Kennedy said. \"And you never know. It's a great mystery. Well, for the first time in my life, I was told 'This is how you're going to go.'\"",
      "\"You come out one of two ways\"",
      "Pande did have one option for Kennedy: They could see if he was eligible for a double-lung transplant. Kennedy, at 74, was older than most patients who undergo the operation, but he was otherwise a promising candidate, Pande said. Lung transplants are usually the final option offered to IPF patients, Pande said, and are usually curative, though a small percentage of patients can see the condition recur.",
      "Kennedy was initially resistant to the idea, because his younger brother had died after the same procedure. But after more convincing from Pande, he agreed to undergo testing to see if he would be eligible. Cleveland Clinic doctors \"scoured everything,\" Kennedy said. Finally, he was approved as a candidate. He was registered on the national transplant list, and waited for a pair of suitable lungs to become available.",
      "As the months passed, Kennedy's lung function continued to degrade. He went from using two liters of oxygen a day to 10. He had a mild case of COVID-19. He lost more than 40 pounds. In October 2025, he was admitted to the hospital.",
      "\"Dr. (Jason) Turkowski, (a transplant pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic) said 'OK, we're going to admit you and you come out one of two ways: With a set of lungs, or we're going to carry you out,'\" Kennedy recalled.",
      "\"You're reminded every breath matters\"",
      "Kennedy spent a month in the hospital. There were two false alarms, where it seemed that a pair of lungs might be available but ultimately were not. The third time was the charm, and on Nov. 15, Kennedy underwent a double-lung transplant.",
      "\"It was a relief. I was apprehensive, obviously, and anxious. I can remember going into the operating room,\" Kennedy said. \"I can remember the flurry of activity, all the people that were in there getting me ready for the surgery. Next thing you know, you're in your room.\"",
      "Just hours after the surgery, Kennedy's lung capacity was already better than it had been in months. He had several setbacks, including a post-surgery infection and a stroke, but his \"indomitable spirit\" has helped him recover, said pulmonologist Rachel Powers, who has been part of Kennedy's post-transplant care team.",
      "\"I'm very proud of him. He really has kept a very good perspective of his course of recovery,\" Powers said. \"He's kept such a good outlook, and I think that's been really important for some of the things that he's had to overcome after transplant.\"",
      "For Kennedy, now 75, life is now beginning to feel normal again. Tests show that his lung capacity is at 98%. He is back to spending time with his wife, children and grandkids. He is able to exercise at home and was recently able to take his dog for a walk without losing his breath. He's almost done training the canine, a Bernese Mountain dog named Fini, to be a hospital therapy dog.",
      "Kennedy had believed Fini would be the last therapy dog he trained, and named him after the retirement flights conducted by Air Force members. But in a few weeks, he'll be getting a new puppy. He plans to name her Encore to celebrate his own second chance. Training hospital therapy dogs has become even more meaningful after his own medical journey, he said.",
      "\"There's a lot of things that are different in my life. It gives you great perspective and proportion of life, of what's important and what isn't,\" Kennedy said. \"You take every breath for granted, because, you know, why would you not? But as soon as they become compromised, you're reminded every breath matters. It keeps you centered.\"",

      "About 3,870 employees have applied to depart NASA over two rounds through the Trump administration's deferred resignation program, NASA disclosed.",
      "The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday.",
      "With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said.",
      "\"Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,\" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner said in a statement.",

      "The\u00a0deferred resignation program\u00a0was a\u00a0buyout program\u00a0introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce.",

    "story": [
      "George Santos, the disgraced former congressman from New York, surrendered himself to a federal prison on Friday to start serving his more than seven-year sentence for fraud.",
      "Santos reported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey.",
      "The ex-Republican congressman from Long Island was sentenced in April to 87 months in prison\u00a0and he was ordered to report\u00a0by 2 p.m. on July 25. He was also ordered to pay $373,949.97 in fines and restitution.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not disclose where Santos would serve his sentence before it started. The bureau says locations are determined based on the level of supervision, medical or programming needs, security measures and proximity to a person's residence.",
      "Santos told his followers he planned to request solitary confinement in prison prior to his sentencing.",
      "Why is George Santos going to prison?",
      "The former congressman pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges for exaggerating or lying about parts of his backstory to defraud voters and donors in New York's 3rd Congressional District.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in their sentencing memo that he \"made a mockery of our election system\" and used a \"wholly fictitious biography to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices.\"",
      "His offenses ranged from getting a vendor to forge a Baruch College diploma to presenting false financial disclosures to Congress claiming he was a multi-millionaire. He was also accused of faking donations in the names of relatives, creating a fake nonprofit to solicit donations and running a credit card fraud scheme to steal from elderly and cognitively impaired donors.",
      "Santos then spent those donations on luxury items from Herm\u00e8s and Ferragamo, Botox, a rent payment and other accommodations in Atlantic City and the Hamptons, according to campaign files, bank records and other documents released by the House Ethics Committee.",
      "\"From the moment he declared his candidacy for congress, Santos leveraged his campaign for his own enrichment and financial benefit,\" U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York John Durham said after the sentencing. \"He did this by targeting specific supporters and constituents. He saw them as easy marks and he made them victims of his fraud.\"",
      "Santos asks Trump for another chance",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Santos to serve the maximum 87 months in prison, while his lawyers sought just 24 months. Santos had asked the judge for leniency and read a statement in court, admitting that he betrayed his supporters and the institutions he was sworn to serve.",
      "After the sentencing, he posted a lengthy statement on X, which read in part, \"I believe that 7 years is an over the top politically influenced sentence and I implore that President Trump gives me a chance to prove I'm more than the mistakes I've made. Respectfully, George Santos.\"",
      "The White House said this week it \"will not comment on the existence or nonexistence\" of any clemency request.",

      "Santos, 37, helped the GOP secure the House in the 2022 midterm elections. But before he was sworn into office, his lies started to unravel.",
      "The first charges were filed against him in May 2023, with more to follow that October. The House Ethics Committee then released a scathing 56-page report detailing the extent of his misconduct.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 The central question in 1947, as the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communist influence in Hollywood, was: \"Are you a member of the Communist Party?\"",
      "Chaired by Republican Rep. John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey, the committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",
      "\"I think it had an enormous effect,\" Anne Lessy, assistant curator of history exhibitions for the historical society, told CBS News of the impact of the blacklist. \"If you wanted to be a part of the film industry, you essentially forfeited your privacy and your right to your own political ideas and affiliations.\"",
      "Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, spent 10 months in prison. His daughter, Mitzi, was 5 years old at the time. Her drawings and letters to him are on display in the exhibit, as well as testimony from those who named suspected Communists.",
      "\"In an effort to save themselves, their careers and their reputations, many, you know, creatives felt compelled to name names, which is what the committee wanted,\" Lessy said.",
      "Even Walt Disney famously testified before the committee.",
      "\"Walt Disney very much objected to labor organizing that had taken place in his studios and blamed it on Communist infiltration,\" Lessy said. \"And then you also have Ronald Reagan, who at the time, was president of the Screen Actors Guild. While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "story": [
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met for a second day with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, without offering more than a broad rationale for his hours of questioning. Multiple former federal prosecutors told CBS News they were bewildered by his decision to launch into such talks and described the unfolding events as both unorthodox and concerning.",
      "\"She's somebody who has been sentenced by a court to 20 years in prison, and she is likely also desperate to get out from under that sentence,\" said Elizabeth Oyer, a former Justice Department pardon attorney and federal public defender. \"It's hard to really believe that the Justice Department would rely on anything that she might have to say.\"",
      "Oyer suggested that Maxwell was speaking with Blanche \"in the hope that she might be able to cut a deal that will benefit her, and that raises fundamental questions about the credibility of any information she could possibly provide.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense lawyer, David Markus, said after the meeting that she answered everything asked of her \"and she didn't hold anything back.\"",
      "Asked whether Maxwell is seeking a pardon, Markus said, \"We haven't spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet,\" adding, \"We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.\"",
      "\"It's unprecedented for the deputy attorney general to be directly involved in interviewing someone who's been convicted of a crime and may be interested in cooperating to get leniency,\" one former senior Justice Department official told CBS News on the condition he not be identified. \"It strikes me simply as an effort to address a political concern, which is not what the Justice Department does.\"",
      "Blanche is a senior Justice Department official who previously served as a personal attorney to President Trump. He is also a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He announced his decision to travel to Florida to meet with Maxwell after days of public attention swirled around the administration's mixed messaging about the possible release of files on Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in the trafficking ring.",
      "Several aspects of the Blanche decision appear to break with longstanding Justice Department practices. Among the most concerning, former officials said, is having Blanche conduct the interviews, rather than the line prosecutors who helped win a conviction in the Maxwell case, and who are continuing to combat her efforts to appeal the outcome.",
      "Adding to the complication is that the prosecutor who led the Maxwell case, Maurene Comey, was fired by the Trump administration a week ago.",
      "One former prosecutor said a key reason for having a line prosecutor handle such an interview is their comprehensive knowledge of both Maxwell and the facts of the case against her. Otherwise, this attorney said, it could be very hard to determine whether Maxwell is being truthful \u2014 especially since there were already past questions about her willingness to be fully candid about the misconduct that led to her arrest, and Epstein's.",
      "\"The best way to determine that is to ask questions you already know the answers to,\" the former prosecutor said. \"Todd Blanche is in no position to assess the truth if he doesn't know all the facts.\"",
      "Because Blanche's meetings were occurring behind closed doors, it is unclear if he was accompanied by other Justice Department officials or FBI agents.",
      "The Justice Department has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News that meetings of this nature almost always include an FBI agent who can memorialize the discussion in formal interview notes that could later have evidentiary value, if needed.",
      "\"If Blanche was meeting with Maxwell alone, that's obscene malpractice,\" another former federal prosecutor, who had decades of experience, told CBS News. \"He can't testify and become a witness, nor can he write a report of their meeting.\"",
      "Prosecutors are not permitted to write up interview reports and are not sworn law enforcement officers with training to document an interview of this kind.",
      "\"It would be a mess,\" the former official said. \"The first rule of a meeting with a witness is to have an agent present.\"",
      "As another former prosecutor put it: \"This is not typical.\"",
      "\"It's not the most effective way\" to work if the goal is to gather additional evidence or identify potential targets for future prosecution, this person said.",
      "Mr. Trump has never been accused of misconduct in connection with Epstein's criminal activity, and he has consistently said he cut ties with Epstein before Epstein's first arrest in 2006 for his conduct with underage girls.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to push past the crush of attention on the topic, even referring to it as \"the Jeffrey Epstein hoax.\"",
      "Blanche explained his decision to meet with Maxwell by saying he would \"pursue justice wherever the facts may lead.\"",
      "\"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche said.",
      "Like Oyer, many former federal prosecutors saw the meeting as a political move intended to dampen growing mistrust about the decision not to make public the files connected with Epstein's case. Multiple former prosecutors spoke with CBS News about the matter, but asked not to be identified because they feared retribution against them or their current employers.",

      "\"He's going to stand up with the belly chains and leg irons he's wearing, he's going to be escorted into the custody of Idaho Department of Correction, and the door will close behind him forever,\" Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said of Kohberger at the sentencing.",
      "Kohberger, a former criminal justice graduate student, is expected to serve out his sentence at Idaho Maximum Security Institution, known as IMSI, CBS affiliate KBOI reports. It is the state's only maximum security prison.",
      "IMSI houses several notorious inmates and has been plagued by reports of violence, hunger strikes and allegations of inhumane conditions in recent years.",
      "Here's what to know about the prison.",
      "One of the \"15 worst prisons in America,\" report says",
      "Located in Kuna, Idaho, about 20 miles from Boise, the Idaho Maximum Security Institution was opened in 1989. According to its\u00a0website, IMSI houses the state's \"most disruptive male residents\" and has a double perimeter fence reinforced with razor wire and an electronic detection system.",
      "The facility was named one of the \"15 Worst Prisons in America\" by Security Journal Americas in 2024 \u2014 joining other notorious lockups like\u00a0Attica Correctional Facility in New York,\u00a0San Quentin in California and ADX Florence, aka the \"Alcatraz of the Rockies,\" in Colorado.",
      "Solitary confinement and lockdowns are common at IMSI, which has \"faced criticism for its harsh treatment of inmates and inadequate mental health care,\" according to Security Journal Americas.",
      "CBS affiliate KBOI reported in 2016 that many of the prison's inmates were locked in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, eating alone in their cells with almost no human interaction. The state's top corrections official told the station at the time that they were working to reduce the use of solitary.",
      "\"IMSI manages the long-term housing of our most dangerous and volatile population,\" the Idaho Department of Correction told CBS News in an email Friday. Asked about the use of solitary confinement and lockdowns, the department said, \"Restrictive housing is not a disciplinary sanction, it is a housing assignment designed to manage specific behaviors.\"",
      "In its description of ISMI, Security Journal Americas notes \"numerous reports of inmate-on-inmate violence, as well as allegations of excessive force by correctional officers.\" In 2023, a fight involving more than 30 inmates broke out at IMSI, the Idaho Statesman\u00a0reported, sending one prisoner to the hospital.",
      "Last summer, dozens of inmates at IMSI refused to eat for six days over numerous grievances, the Idaho Statesman\u00a0reported, and earlier this month, nearly 90 inmates planned to stage hunger strikes to protest \"inhumane conditions\" at the prison,\u00a0according to the paper. The corrections department described it as \"a planned, peaceful demonstration\" over access to visitation and programming.",
      "Chad Daybell and 2 serial killers are there",
      "Kohberger\u00a0took a plea deal earlier this month that spared him a possible death penalty. He'll be living alongside all of Idaho's eight male death row inmates at IMSI,\u00a0according to the Idaho Department of Correction.",
      "Among those prisoners is\u00a0Thomas Creech, a serial killer who's been locked up for half a century. Creech, who was convicted of five murders in three states and suspected of several more, had his scheduled execution halted by a judge last November after his first lethal injection attempt was botched earlier in 2024.",
      "Another serial killer incarcerated at ISMI, Gerald Pizzuto, is awaiting execution for two murders in Idaho in 1985. That same year, Pizzuto killed two other people in Washington state after being released from prison in Michigan for rape.",
      "Kohberger will also be at the same facility that houses condemned killer Chad Daybell. The husband of \"Doomsday mom\" Lori Vallow Daybell\u00a0was\u00a0convicted of first-degree murder of his first wife and two of his then-girlfriend Lori Vallow's children, Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow and Tylee Ryan, in a case that made national headlines. Chad Daybell was\u00a0sentenced to death last June, nearly a year after Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Kohberger behind bars",
      "Police files on the quadruple murder case that were released by the Moscow, Idaho, police department Wednesday night shed some light on Kohberger's life behind bars since the killings.",
      "One man who was housed next to Kohberger's cell at the Latah County Jail told a detective that Kohberger washed his hands dozens of times each day and spent up to an hour in the shower. He said Kohberger would \"be awake almost all night and would only take a nap during the day.\"",
      "Another prisoner at the jail said he often overheard Kohberger on video calls with his mother, according to the police files. One time when Kohberger was talking to his mother, the inmate, who was watching sports, said \"'you suck' to one of the players on the team, at which point Kohberger immediately got up and put his face to the bars and aggressively asked if [the inmate] was talking about him or his mother. [The inmate] said this was the only time Kohberger lost his temper,\" the police report says.",
      "Another inmate who encountered Kohberger voiced negative feelings toward him, according to the files. The man called Kohberger a \"weirdo\" and said \"if he wasn't worried about further legal [re]percussions he would have physically assaulted Kohberger,\" the police document says.",
      "When asked by another inmate if he thought Kohberger was guilty of the crimes, he said yes, adding: \"His eyes tell a story.\"",

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

    "story": [
      "Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison Friday on two murder conspiracy convictions in Arizona, marking an end to a winding legal saga for the mother with doomsday religious beliefs who claimed people in her life had been possessed by evil spirits.",
      "Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho in the killings of her two youngest children and a romantic rival, was convicted at separate trials this spring in Phoenix of conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. She represented herself, despite not being a lawyer.",
      "Authorities say she carried out the plots with her brother Alex Cox, who acknowledged killing Vallow in July 2019 and was identified by prosecutors as the person who fired at Boudreaux months later but missed.",
      "Prosecutors say Vallow Daybell conspired to kill her husband so she could collect on his $1 million life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author of several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world. They say Boudreaux suspected Vallow Daybell and Cox were responsible for Vallow's death and went into hiding with his children because he feared Cox would kill him.",
      "Nearly two years ago, Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in an Idaho prison for killing her children, 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, and conspiring to murder Daybell's wife, Tammy. The children went missing for several months before their bodies were found buried in rural Idaho on Daybell's property. Daybell was sentenced to death for the gruesome murders of his wife, Tylee and JJ.",
      "At her Arizona trials, Vallow Daybell argued her brother acted in self-defense when killing Vallow. She also said no evidence showed she conspired with Cox to kill Boudreaux.",
      "Vallow Daybell appeared in court Friday in an orange jail uniform as family members called her \"evil,\" \"greedy\" and a \"monster\" while describing their grief. The victims' family members sat in the jury box, passing around tissues. Colby Ryan, Vallow Daybell's only surviving child who testified by remote link, described how he \"had to fight to stay alive after the pain\" of losing his father and siblings.",
      "Ryan zeroed in on his mother, who has claimed the Arizona cases were family tragedies that shouldn't have ended up in court. \"I believe that Lori Vallow herself is the family tragedy,\" Ryan said.",
      "Charles Vallow was fatally shot in 2019",
      "Charles Vallow filed for divorce four months before he died. He said Vallow Daybell became infatuated with near-death experiences and claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets. He told police she threatened to kill him and he was concerned for his children.",
      "Vallow was shot when he went to pick up his son at Vallow Daybell's home outside Phoenix, police said. Vallow Daybell's daughter, Tylee, told police the sound of yelling woke her up, and she confronted Vallow with a baseball bat that he managed to take from her. Cox told police he shot Vallow after he refused to drop the bat and came after him.",
      "Cox died five months later from a blood clot in his lungs. His self-defense claim was later called into question, with investigators saying Cox and Vallow Daybell waited more than 40 minutes before calling 911.",
      "Just before his death, Vallow and his wife's other brother, Adam Cox, planned an intervention to try to bring Vallow Daybell back into the mainstream of their shared faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Adam Cox, a witness for the prosecution, testified that his sister told people Vallow was no longer living and that a zombie was inside her estranged husband's body.",
      "Gerry Vallow, Charles Vallow's brother, told the judge Friday that Vallow Daybell cheated on his brother with Chad Daybell while she was plotting to kill Charles Vallow. She isn't misunderstood, Gerry Vallow said.",
      "\"She wrote her own make-believe story, and she wrote it in blood,\" he said. \"She tried to kill Brandon when he started looking like the next available dollar sign.\"",
      "Someone shot at Brandon Boudreaux months later",
      "Almost three months after Vallow died, someone fired a shot at Boudreaux from an open window of a Jeep as he was driving up to his home in Gilbert, another Phoenix suburb. It narrowly missed Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell's niece, Melani Pawlowski.",
      "Boudreaux described in court Friday how Vallow Daybell betrayed him and how the attempt on his life caused him heartache and worry about his family's safety. Boudreaux's sisters told the judge that their brother went into hiding with his children.",
      "\"No one deserves to live a life of fear and trauma,\" Boudreaux said tearfully. He said he has forgiven Vallow Daybell so he can be a better person but that he wouldn't feel safe if she has freedom.",
      "Boudreaux has said Pawlowski aspired to be like her aunt. The two started attending religious meetings together in 2018. Soon after, Pawlowski said they should stockpile food for the end of the world.",
      "Prosecutors tied the Jeep to Vallow Daybell and said she loaned it to Alex Cox. The two bought a burner phone used to carry out the attack and tried to concoct an alibi for Cox to make it seem like he was in Idaho at the time, prosecutors said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday said he's considering issuing rebate checks for Americans based on the billions in new tariff revenue collected by his administration.",
      "\"We're thinking about a little rebate. But the big thing we want to do is pay down debt. But we're thinking about a rebate,\" Mr. Trump said in comments to reporters before he left for a\u00a0four-day visit to Scotland.",
      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining.

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

His comments came as a Hamas official said negotiations were expected to resume next week and portrayed the recall of the Israeli and American delegations as a pressure tactic.",

      "The Zikim crossing shootings come days after at least 79 Palestinians were killed trying to reach aid entering through the same crossing. Israel's military said at the time its soldiers shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians who posed a threat, and that it was aware of some casualties.",

      "Thailand and Cambodia traded accusations Saturday of fresh attacks as deadly border clashes entered a third day, leaving at least 33 people dead and more than 168,000 displaced, as international pressure mounted on both sides to reach a ceasefire.",
      "Artillery fire and gunshots were reported near several border villages, expanding the area of the fighting that flared again Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Cambodian and Thai officials claimed to have acted in retaliation.",
      "Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand closed its northeastern border crossings with Cambodia.",
      "Cambodian authorities reported on Saturday 12 new deaths, bringing its toll to 13, while Thai officials said a soldier was killed, raising the deaths to 20, mostly civilians.",
      "The regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, is under growing pressure to defuse the situation between its two members. During an emergency meeting on Friday, members of the U.N. Security Council called for de-escalation and urged ASEAN to mediate a peaceful solution.",
      "The 500-mile frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The current tensions broke out in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand's domestic politics.",
      "Fresh attacks and rising tension",
      "Cambodia's Defense Ministry condemned what it said was an expanded Thai offensive early Saturday after five heavy artillery shells were fired into multiple locations in the province of Pursat, calling the attack an \"unprovoked and premeditated act of aggression.\"",
      "Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata, said tensions flared in the province of Koh Kong, where four Thai naval vessels were reportedly stationed offshore and four others en route. She said the naval deployment was an \"act of aggression\" that risked further escalation.",

      "The Thai army had denied targeting Cambodian civilian sites and accused Phnom Penh of using \"human shields\" by positioning their weapons near residential areas.",
      "Meanwhile, Thailand's navy, in a statement Saturday, accused Cambodian forces of initiating a new attack in the province of Trat, saying Thai forces responded swiftly and \"successfully pushed back the Cambodian incursion at three key points\", warning that \"aggression will not be tolerated.\"",

Children have been harmed and Thai authorities have closed at least 852 schools and seven hospitals for safety reasons, the rights group said in a statement Saturday.",
      "Both sides have employed rocket and artillery attacks, and after initially denying Cambodian claims that internationally prohibited cluster munitions were being used, a Thai military spokesperson in a statement Friday said that such weapons could be utilized \"when necessary\" to target military objectives. HRW condemned the use of cluster munitions in populated areas.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said Thursday the U.S. was cutting short the latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks and bringing its negotiating team home from Qatar for consultations, after he said Hamas had issued a response that \"shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.\"",
      "The talks have been bogged down over conflicting demands on terms to end the 21-month war. Hamas says it will only release all of the hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war.",

      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday evening, a Hamas official said the group had \"always behaved with high responsibility to conclude a comprehensive, viable and practical deal that can grant a permanent ceasefire and put an end to the suffering of our people, and I wonder how can someone consider this as selfishness.\"",
      "The official said he was \"really surprised\" by the \"out of context statement by the U.S. envoy and the overarching attitude that reflects a preprepared, irresponsible and negative response\" by the U.S.",
      "The official stressed that Hamas was \"still involved in the ceasefire talks\" and expected the mediators and the international community to \"carry their responsibility\" to alleviate the dire circumstances in Gaza.",
      "Earlier Thursday, an Israeli official had told The Associated Press that Hamas' latest response was \"workable.\"",
      "Another official with knowledge of the ceasefire talks told The AP that Hamas had submitted a \"positive response\" through Qatari mediators.",
      "Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken hostage. Most of the captives have been released or rescued, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says 50 remain in Gaza, including 20 still believed to be alive.",
      "The war has killed more than 59,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians, but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "\"Children in the Gaza Strip are starving to death\"",
      "As Israel's blockade and military offensive in Gaza grinds on, four major news organizations said Thursday that their journalists in the Palestinian enclave were facing the threat of starvation. The joint statement by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters and the BBC called on Israel to allow journalists in and out of Gaza and to allow adequate food supplies into the territory.",
      "The United Nations backed the call by the media organizations for Israel to let adequate food supplies into Gaza and allow journalists to enter and exit freely. U.N. staff in Gaza are hungry, too, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Thursday.",
      "People are starving \"because we're just not getting in,\" Haq said, reiterating that obstacles imposed by Israel were inhibiting the delivery of U.N. aid.",
      "\"If this does not get better soon and more aid goes through all the various checkpoints, people will die,\" he said. \"We've been saying this for months, and now we're at the point where, in fact, people are dying.\"",
      "UNICEF, the U.N.'s Children's Fund, said in a statement on Thursday that 798 Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed near aid distribution sites in Gaza between May 27 and July 7 while seeking food.",
      "More than 100 people have died in Gaza from malnutrition since the war started, UNICEF said, and 80% were children. The charity said screening in the Palestinian enclave had found 6,000 children in a state of acute malnourishment in June alone, marking a 180% increase since February.",
      "\"Children in the Gaza Strip are starving to death. Severe malnutrition is spreading among children faster than aid can reach them, and the world is watching it happen,\" UNICEF Regional Director for the Mideast Edouard Beigbeder said in the group's statement.",

      "Meanwhile, two Jordanian officials told CBS News that Amman is also considering aid airdrops over Gaza. Planning is in the initial stages, and Jordan is looking at encouraging other nations to also participate. Late Friday, an Emirati official told CBS News that the UAE is considering joining the airdrops over Gaza.",
      "Two Jordanian officials told CBS News that the Jordanian Air Force is involved in central coordination of the potential aid deliveries. Jordan has not yet received official approval from Israel, but as soon as it does, it may proceed.",
      "A United Arab Emirates official also told CBS News that there is a 7,000-ton aid ship en route to Gaza at this time. The official said the ship was already cleared by Israel.",
      "A Saudi Arabian official told CBS News it has sent tons of aid intended for Gaza, but that the aid has been sitting undelivered for weeks. The issue, the official said, is that the Israeli government has rejected nearly all of the food parcels.",
      "Israel says it is allowing enough aid into Gaza and it blames U.N. agencies for failing to distribute it. But those agencies say it's nearly impossible to safely deliver aid because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order in Gaza, with crowds of thousands swarming around food trucks as soon as they move into the territory.",
      "UNICEF said that from May 19 to July 2, an average of 30 U.N. aid trucks entered Gaza per day, compared to the average of 500 trucks per day that were entering before the war. The charity said current food supplies in Gaza amounted to about 6% of the normal, pre-war levels.",
      "In greater numbers than ever, children hollowed up by hunger are overwhelming the Patient's Friends Hospital, the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza.",
      "Staff at the facility said five young children who died last weekend of malnutrition marked a change: They were the first deaths seen at the center in children who had no preexisting conditions. Symptoms are getting worse, with children too weak to cry or move, said Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutritionist. In past months, most children brought in malnourished improved with treatment, despite supply shortages, but now patients stay longer and don't get better, she said.",
      "The lack of basic health care and sanitation is also enabling deadly diseases to spread in Gaza, the charity OXFAM warned on Friday.",
      "\"Water-borne diseases that are both preventable and readily treatable have increased by almost 150% inside Gaza over the past three months as Israel continues to deliberately block aid,\" the group said. \"Available multi-agency health data shows that the numbers of Palestinians presenting to health facilities with acute watery diarrhea have increased by 150 percent, bloody diarrhea by 302 percent, and acute jaundice cases by 101 percent.\"",
      "OXFAM said the figures were likely \"grossly under-reported because most of the two million people trapped by Israel's continuing siege have little access to the few healthcare facilities that have managed to keep operating.\"",

But since 2012, it's been right in the middle of Trump territory, surrounded by hundreds of acres of shifting sand dunes that have been meticulously sculpted into 36 holes that anyone can play a round on \u2014 for about $500.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 16:14:22 -0400",
    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",

      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",
      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",
      "But Australian demand for U.S. beef is likely to remain low despite the eased restrictions, for reasons including a relatively weak Australian dollar.",
      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",
      "Australia's opposition to any U.S. tariffs will be high on the agenda when Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secures his first face-to-face meeting with Mr. Trump.",
      "Albanese and Mr. Trump were to hold a one-on-one meeting on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit in Canada last month, but the U.S. president left early.",
      "Albanese expects the pair will meet this year, although no date has been announced.",
      "The two countries have had a bilateral free trade deal for 20 years and the U.S. has maintained a trade surplus with Australia for decades.",

With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there.

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private.

      "What is structural heart disease, and why is it so dangerous?",
      "SHD refers to defects in the heart's walls, valves or chambers. Some are present at birth. Others develop slowly over time. Either way, they often go unnoticed until something major happens, like a heart attack or stroke. That's why experts sometimes call SHD the \"hidden\" heart disease. Here's the problem. Even the ECGs doctors routinely use to spot heart issues often can't detect SHD on their own. And that's where EchoNext comes in.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "EchoNext: The AI that knows when to dig deeper",
      "EchoNext was created by researchers at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian. The tool was trained on over 1.2 million ECG and echocardiogram pairs from more than 230,000 patients. Its job? Figure out when a patient's ECG suggests a deeper look is needed, specifically, an echocardiogram, the ultrasound that gives a detailed view of heart structure.",

Even more impressive, when tested on nearly 85,000 people, EchoNext identified over 7,500 at high risk for undiagnosed SHD. A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",

EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",

      "This means fewer surprises, fewer missed diagnoses and a better shot at treatment before it's too late. It's not about replacing doctors. It's about giving them, and you, a better shot at catching problems early. Ask your doctor if AI tools are being used to review your heart tests. You deserve every advantage.

    "story": [
      "The 126 MW Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park spans 642 acres, boosting green power. Kurt Knutsson reports on this innovative solution to global energy challenges.",
      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",
      "However, you are not without options, and you have a defense. Let's walk through what you can do if your PC is still running Windows 10.",

      "Image showing Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Windows 11 finally surpasses Windows 10 in market share: Here's why it took so long",
      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "If you decide to stick with Windows 10 beyond its official support period, having strong third-party antivirus protection becomes even more important. While Microsoft Defender will continue receiving updates until 2028, it may not be enough on its own once the system stops getting core security patches. Installing a reputable antivirus program can help protect your device from malware, phishing, and other threats.",

      "The end of Windows 10 support isn\u2019t a crisis, but it does require action. You should start planning your next move now. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Windows. You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that.

For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

      "Scientific diagram explaining the coffee ring effect in new at-home diagnostics. (UC Berkeley)",
      "How the coffee ring effect led to a breakthrough in at-home medical testing",
      "Surprisingly, that annoying coffee ring on your table has inspired a major breakthrough in medical technology. Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

      "Kicking a ball or climbing stairs with ease after a leg amputation above the knee is now within reach. Researchers at MIT have developed a bionic knee that redefines mobility for above-the-knee amputees. Unlike traditional socket-based prosthetics, this system anchors directly to the bone and integrates with the surrounding muscle tissue. The result is faster, smoother, and more natural movement.",
      "Led by Professor Hugh Herr, the MIT team created a solution that doesn't just mimic motion, it responds to intent. This level of control allows the prosthesis to move in sync with the body, delivering a seamless experience that challenges the very definition of artificial limbs.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",
      "One participant with only a few inches of thigh remaining could walk, pivot, and even kick a ball smoothly. This kind of intuitive, natural movement is a game-changer for above-the-knee amputees.",
      "Illustration of a new e-OPRA bionic knee that can help people with above-the-knee amputations. (MIT)",
      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",
      "A man kicking balls while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "When the bionic knee for amputees will be available",
      "While the results are groundbreaking, the e-OPRA system isn't on the market yet. Larger clinical trials and FDA approval are still ahead. Herr estimates that within five years, this technology could become more accessible to patients.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We're witnessing the future of\u00a0prosthetics unfold. The bionic knee developed by MIT doesn't just restore function, it redefines it. By merging advanced robotics with the human nervous system, it offers amputees something priceless: the feeling that their body is whole again.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

Both allow it to perform seven varied medical procedures using a remote control operated by a human using foot pedals, HTC Vive trackers, and motion-capture cameras.",
      "These tasks the robot carried out ranged from physical exams like auscultation and palpation, to emergency procedures such as Bag Valve Mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. Some of them even required a great deal of precision, like ultrasound-guided injections.",
      "There were some challenges with force control and sensor sensitivity, but the robot managed to carry out most tasks given to it with accuracy.",
      "The Unitree G1 humanoid robot performing an ultrasound. (UCSD ARCLAB)",
      "Medical robot trial results show strong potential for hospital use",
      "For examinations, it successfully used a stethoscope and performed basic physical examinations. In these tests, performance was hindered by limitations in sensor feedback and hand design. For emergency care, it achieved consistent ventilation. However, it required human assistance to maintain the necessary seal and force required for intubation.",
      "When it came to needle procedures, it performed ultrasound-guided injections. It achieved a 70% success rate when performed by non-clinicians, demonstrating its potential for training purposes. Trials showed issues with needle control and orientation during suturing, indicating that the haptic feedback mechanisms need improvement.",

      "How humanoid robots could transform healthcare and hospital staffing",
      "This is the first major study to add humanoid robots to hospital work systems. With aging populations and ongoing labor shortages, these adaptable robots could support routine and emergency tasks in hospital settings. This robot could take immense pressure off medical staff. The versatility and ability to be remotely controlled make it particularly appealing for settings that require rapid response and tools that can carry out a wide range of tasks.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've ever waited too long in an ER, struggled to book a specialist appointment, or worried about overworked healthcare providers, this research should catch your attention. Humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 aren't replacing doctors, but they could support them in real, practical ways. From performing emergency procedures in remote areas to helping with routine physical exams in crowded hospitals, these robots could ease bottlenecks and improve care access.",
      "For patients, that could mean shorter wait times, faster treatment, and safer hospital environments where medical teams are less stretched. For families in rural or underserved areas, this technology could offer critical care support where medical staff is limited. And for healthcare workers, it could bring much-needed relief by taking on repetitive or physically taxing tasks.",
      "While the tech is still evolving, these early results suggest a future where hospitals have robotic teammates, not just tools, helping deliver faster, smarter care.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 are not ready to fully replace humans, they're steadily proving how capable they are in medical environments. The researchers just need to solve issues like force control, sensitivity, and dexterity. Once they do, we will see these robots in operating rooms around the world assisting with surgeries. They will make our struggling healthcare systems far more resilient and accessible.",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",

      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",

In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Amazon is using AI to improve product listings",
      "Starfish builds on earlier AI tools that Amazon began testing in 2023. These tools could:",
      "Automatically generate product images and video adsFill in missing data for third-party listingsRewrite product titles, bullet points and descriptions to be more relevant",
      "Automatically generate product images and video ads",
      "Fill in missing data for third-party listings",
      "Rewrite product titles, bullet points and descriptions to be more relevant",
      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "The former senior CIA officer who helped oversee the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election says Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and the White House are \u201clying\u201d when they claim that it was an attempt to sabotage President Donald Trump.",
      "Susan Miller, a retired CIA officer who helped lead the team that produced the report about Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 campaign, told NBC News it was based on credible information that showed Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, but that there was no sign of a conspiracy between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.",
      "\u201cThe director of national intelligence and the White House are lying, again,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe definitely had the intel to show with high probability that the specific goal of the Russians was to get Trump elected.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAt the same time, we found no two-way collusion between Trump or his team with the Russians at that time.\u201d",
      "Miller spoke to NBC News after Gabbard alleged Wednesday that the 2017 intelligence assessment was based on \u201cmanufactured\u201d information as part of a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d by the Obama administration to undermine Trump and tarnish his electoral victory. Gabbard cited a 2020 report from Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which she declassified and released this week, that asserted there was insufficient information to conclude Russia had been trying to tip the scales in favor of Trump.",
      "Miller said \u201cit is clear that Trump and his followers have a script they want to follow, despite the facts.\u201d",
      "She said that when her team briefed Trump and others about their assessment in 2017, they made clear there was no way to gauge the impact of the Russian information warfare on the vote, and that Trump was the country\u2019s lawful commander in chief.",
      "\u201cBoth me and my team readily acknowledged \u2014 to Trump and others in the USG [U.S. government] we briefed \u2014 that we could not say if this attempt by the Russians actually worked unless someone polled every single Trump voter to see if this disinformation was what led them to vote for Trump,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBoth my team and I and DCIA [the director of the CIA] said clearly in our report to Trump himself and to the intel committees [in Congress] that Trump was our president,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Trump thanked the CIA director for the briefing, Miller said.",
      "\u201cThat part was left out by Gabbard,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence dismissed Miller\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cSusan is wrong. And the American people can read for themselves hundreds of reasons why she is wrong in the declassified HPSCI report,\u201d said ODNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman, referring to the 2020 Republican House intelligence report.",
      "The Republican House report was emphatically rejected at the time by Democratic lawmakers on the panel. But a bipartisan Senate probe released the same year endorsed the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic party to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and bolster Trump\u2019s prospects. Trump\u2019s current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time and endorsed the conclusions of the panel\u2019s report.",
      "When asked about Miller\u2019s defense of the intelligence assessment, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: \u201cDirector Gabbard declassified documents in the name of transparency to show the world that the Obama administration was indeed behind the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Those who participated in criminal activity will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d",
      "In advance of the 2016 election, intelligence reporting indicated Russia was trying to influence the election with disinformation, Miller said. After the vote, John Brennan \u2014 who was CIA director at the time and is now a paid NBC News and MSNBC contributor \u2014 asked her to put together a task force that would rigorously examine Russia\u2019s role in the election.",
      "Miller, who served nine tours abroad with CIA during her 39-year career, was head of agency counterintelligence at the time. She said she put together a team with a range of skills and expertise, including analysts and officers working in counterintelligence.",
      "As they began their work on the assessment, Miller said, she and the rest of her team were keenly aware of the polarized political climate in the country in the aftermath of the election. They were facing pressure from officials both inside and outside the CIA.",
      "\u201cThere were people that hated Trump that wanted us to find that Trump was complicit. And there were those that loved Trump. They wanted us to find nothing. And we ignored all of it,\u201d Miller said.",
      "\u201cWe just kept ourselves neutral,\u201d she added. \u201cWe just decided to let the data speak for itself. ... We had very, very good data coming in.\u201d",
      "Brennan did not pressure or micromanage the task force, she said. Gabbard, current CIA Director John Ratcliffe and the White House have accused Brennan of fabricating intelligence about the 2016 election to undermine Trump. Brennan has rejected the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "The task force examined every possible angle, Miller said, including whether Trump and his campaign somehow conspired with the Kremlin to skew the election outcome. They did not find intelligence to support that scenario, she said.",
      "After sifting through all the intelligence and publicly available information, the team concluded that Russia had waged a large-scale information warfare campaign to undermine America\u2019s democratic process, damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and boost Trump\u2019s chances.",
      "\u201cThe paper was multiple pages long, but the summary of it is 100% they tried to influence the election, and 100% we can\u2019t say if it worked unless we polled every voter,\u201d Miller said.",
      "When the assessment was wrapping up and a draft was being edited, then-FBI Director James Comey asked that the report include a dossier about Trump by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, according to Miller and a Senate report from 2020, which cited accounts from multiple officials, including Comey and Brennan. The dossier featured unverified allegations about Trump that had not been corroborated by U.S. intelligence agencies, and CIA officials argued against adding references to the dossier in the report.",
      "\u201cWe had already written the paper and it was going through edits,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The FBI\u2019s stance annoyed Miller. Her view was that \u201cwe can\u2019t just shove this in\u201d to the assessment at such a late stage and that \u201cit\u2019s going to take us another six months to go and try to figure out if this is true,\u201d she said.",
      "But the FBI insisted that if the dossier were not included, the bureau would withdraw and not endorse the intelligence assessment, according to Miller. \u201cThe FBI said that \u2018unless you tag it onto the end of it, then we\u2019re not going to sign off on this,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In the end, the CIA and the FBI worked out a compromise. The dossier was included in an annex to the assessment, with a disclaimer that the claims in the file had not been verified by the intelligence community.",
      "Comey could not be reached for comment.",
      "Later on during the first Trump administration, Miller was called up to the general counsel\u2019s office at the CIA. There, she said, an agency lawyer told her she was facing possible criminal charges over her role leading the assessment.",
      "Miller assumed it was a joke. \u201cI laughed out loud.\u201d But it was not.",
      "Miller decided to hire a lawyer, though it was unclear what potential criminal charge was in play. The administration eventually used a special counsel, John Durham, to investigate how the previous administration had handled probes into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.",
      "Durham\u2019s team questioned Miller for hours. They asked her questions about whether she had an anti-Republican bias that influenced how the assessment was written, Miller said.",
      "\u201cI was answering questions like, \u2018Tell us how you hate all Republicans, and that\u2019s why you wrote this paper.\u2019 Actually, if you look at my registration, I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d",
      "Miller was never charged with any crime and she said she was never disciplined in any way over the intelligence assessment. She retired during the Biden administration after 39 years with the CIA.",
      "Earlier this month, Ratcliffe declassified an internal \u201clessons learned\u201d review looking at how the intelligence assessment was drafted. The internal review found that some standard procedures were not followed and that the report was rushed, but did not question the conclusions of the assessment.",
      "Miller said no one at the CIA contacted her for the internal review. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Nine years since the 2016 election, Russia is likely pleased to see yet more political acrimony in Washington over what transpired, according to Miller.",
      "\u201cPutin and his BFFs in the Kremlin are toasting vodka shots as we speak at the turmoil this is creating,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.",
      "\u201cContinental drying\u201d has redirected the planet\u2019s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.",
      "Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world\u2019s richest agricultural regions.",
      "\u201cWe use a lot of water to grow food,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. \u201cIf things don\u2019t change, we\u2019ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.\u201d",
      "The findings \u201cshould be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,\u201d the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends \u201csend perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth\u2019s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.",
      "The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth\u2019s water, including changes to the planet\u2019s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.",
      "The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.",
      "In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected \u201cmega-drying\u201d regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.",
      "\u201cThe key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,\u201d said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.",
      "The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.",
      "Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.",
      "Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.",
      "The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet\u2019s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent \u2014 or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.",
      "\u201cIf you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cWater goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.",
      "Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.",
      "\u201cThis kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can track that water, if we know where it\u2019s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Immigration officials have been repeatedly spotted outside a Hollywood homeless shelter since May, leading staff to accompany residents from war-torn countries to work, errands and court.",
      "An executive at the shelter that serves people ages 18 to 24 said she saw two Venezuelan men handcuffed and arrested by ICE agents after they returned to the shelter from work.",
      "\u201cThere was no conversation,\u201d said the employee, Lailanie, who asked that her last name not be used because she feared retribution from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "She said about half a dozen immigration officers went up to the residents \u201cand put their hands behind their backs right away.\u201d",
      "Homeless shelters appear to be another target in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration crackdown, which has resulted in nearly 3,000 arrests in the Los Angeles area. They now join Home Depots, 7-Elevens and cannabis farms as locations where the federal government is carrying out its mass deportation effort.",
      "In addition to the Hollywood shelter, service providers have reported seeing immigration enforcement at shelters in North Hollywood and San Diego, according to local media.",
      "Immigration officials did not respond to an email asking if homeless shelters are being targeted as part of enforcement efforts.",
      "With more than than 72,300 unhoused people, Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the nation\u2019s homelessness crisis. How many of them are immigrants is unknown because the federally mandated annual count does not include citizenship questions.",
      "The encounter at the Hollywood shelter took place a few weeks before President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the region in response to large-scale protests against his deportation efforts.",
      "Service providers in Los Angeles said the stepped-up enforcement effort has made their work more difficult because their clients are consumed by fears of deportation.",
      "Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the aggressive operation \u201cputs a target\u201d on the backs of homeless immigrants.",
      "\u201cIt villainizes them,\u201d he said.",
      "At another shelter, The People Concern in downtown Los Angeles, fewer clients are stopping by to use showers and other public facilities because they are afraid ICE agents will show up, said CEO John Maceri.",
      "He said even U.S. citizens at its permanent housing facility in the San Fernando Valley are hesitant to go outside because they are afraid they will be stopped and questioned by ICE.",
      "\u201cFrankly, anybody who\u2019s dark-skinned, Black and brown people, but particularly dark-skinned brown people, don\u2019t want to go out,\u201d Maceri said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to the grocery store. A few of them are missing work. They\u2019re really scared. This fear factor is really taking effect.\u201d",
      "The highest concentrations of ICE arrests in Los Angeles have occurred in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley, according to the nonprofit Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA.",
      "U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who is from the San Fernando Valley and was himself handcuffed by federal agents last month at a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said the numbers reflect a strategy by the Trump administration to target vulnerable communities, not just the violent criminals he promised to arrest during his campaign.",
      "\u201cThis is an administration who proudly changed policy to pursue these enforcement actions in workplaces, in schools, including elementary schools, and houses of worship,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were only focusing on dangerous, violent criminals, you\u2019re not going to find them at schools and churches and homeless camps.\u201d",
      "A map released Tuesday by CHIRLA showed that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley. It did not specify how many of the arrestees were homeless people.",
      "CHIRLA President Angelica Salas said the data highlighted \u201cracial profiling\u201d by federal officials, who have denied targeting people based on their skin color.",
      "\u201cWhat makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. \u2014 NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,\u201d DHS said in a recent statement.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order that encourages cities to remove homeless people from their streets. Whitehead said the order could trigger more arrests of homeless people and further heighten their fears.",
      "At the homeless shelter where the two Venezuelan men were arrested, residents remain on high alert, Lailanie said. Immigrants are now accompanied to work, errands and court appointments by staff in unmarked cars without the organization\u2019s logo.",
      "Officials at the shelter requested that its name not be used out of fear of retribution by the Trump administration.",
      "The Venezuelans, who are 20 and 22 years old, barely speak English and had been living at the shelter for a few weeks before they were arrested, she said.",
      "They had not been there long enough to be paired with immigration lawyers, she said. The 22-year-old was deported, and employees have been unable to locate the younger man, she said.",
      "Since the arrests, staff members have witnessed at least three immigration stakeouts around the facility, two shelter employees said.",
      "On one occasion, a uniformed officer asked to use a bathroom inside the center. A maintenance worker allowed him to enter because he didn\u2019t know what else to do, the two employees said.",
      "Staffers have also seen unmarked black SUVs parked near the center and in the parking lot.",
      "Most recently, an asylum-seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who had been living at the shelter was arrested after reporting to immigration court, according to two people who work at the shelter.",
      "The employees said that before his arrest, he had difficulty applying for jobs because he wore an ankle monitor, which was given to him when he presented himself to immigration officials.",
      "Confused, he went to immigration court and asked officials to remove the monitor, the two employees said, but he was arrested instead. He was taken to the High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto, California, while his lawyer pleaded his asylum case, which is still pending, according to Lailanie.",
      "He fears being returned to central Africa, where his father was killed, she said.",

She told NBC News she was motivated by Valadao\u2019s support for the bill and plans to make health care a defining issue in the campaign against him.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that I ever envisioned for myself. I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d Bains said of her decision to run for Congress. \u201cWhen I saw Valadao vote for the \u2018big, beautiful bill,\u2019 I was shocked. As was everyone. How could you do that in a district that has some of the highest needs? Some of the highest Medicaid patients in the country?\u201d",
      "Randy Villegas, a school board trustee who is affiliated with the Working Families Party, is also mounting a bid in the 22nd District.",
      "Even prior to his vote on the megabill, Valadao was seen as one of the more vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2026. After he lost in 2018, Valadao made a comeback bid and returned to Congress the following cycle. But his vote for Trump\u2019s bill could now put his swing seat even more at risk. Valadao\u2019s district has the highest share of Medicaid recipients and households receiving food stamps of any represented by a Republican in Congress, according to an NBC News analysis.",
      "In a preview of the attack ads to come, House Majority Forward, a nonprofit group aligned with Democratic leadership, and the League of Conservation Voters are launching new ads next week hitting Valadao over his support for the bill, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The agriculturally rich region, which relies heavily on migrant farmworkers, is also bracing for mass deportations that some fear could disrupt the local economy and national food supply chains. Valadao has urged Trump to prioritize deporting criminals over undocumented laborers, but the administration has sent mixed signals about its approach.",
      "It all has the community here on edge.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely scared. I\u2019m worried about it,\u201d 53-year-old Rick Garcia, a local resident who relies on Medicaid after he was permanently paralyzed in his early 20s, told NBC News in an interview about the health care cuts.",
      "Valadao had repeatedly vowed to oppose the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d warning just several days before final passage that he couldn\u2019t support the Senate product. But he ended up supporting that version without any changes to the legislation.",
      "When asked how he felt about Valadao\u2019s vote, Garcia told NBC News: \u201cBetrayed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a politician and you\u2019re gonna say you\u2019re gonna do something, you\u2019re relying on that politician to do something about that problem,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBe a man of your word.\u201d",
      "Republicans argue that only those they say don\u2019t deserve to be on Medicaid, like undocumented immigrants and able-bodied adults who don\u2019t work, will be kicked off the program. But Garcia said the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, has already tried to remove him twice before, so he worries people could erroneously get swept up in all the new changes or will struggle to navigate the more frequent eligibility check-ins.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected Trump\u2019s new law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10 million by 2034.",
      "Valadao\u2019s office said the congressman was not available for an interview for this story. In a statement after the House vote on the bill earlier this month, Valadao defended his decision.",
      "\u201cI voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid program for its intended recipients \u2014 children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,\u201d he said.",
      "Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee, said the bill that Valadao voted for will \u201cease the burden on hardworking Californians\u201d and took a swipe at Villegas and Bains.",
      "\u201cTheir far-left agenda will continue to wreck California\u2019s economy, raise taxes, and put illegal immigrants ahead of California families,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "Valadao has stood up to his own party before. Most notably, he was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Trump has since further tightened his grip on the party, even threatening to back primary challenges to Republicans who stood in the way of his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "The sprawling domestic policy bill extends Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, removes some taxes on tips and overtime, and beefs up funding for immigration enforcement and the military. While the legislation is generally unpopular in public polling, Republicans are betting once they start selling it, their members will be rewarded for supporting it.",
      "Some local business owners in Valadao\u2019s district hailed the bill and praised Valadao for backing it.",
      "Rob Taylor, who has owned Stafford\u2019s Chocolates in Portersville for the last 14 years, said he thinks some of the bill\u2019s tax provisions will be a boon for small businesses like his.",
      "\u201cI appreciate Valadao sticking up for himself and his constituents here,\u201d Taylor, who has voted for Valadao in the past, told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a rubber stamp. He does look at both sides [of an issue].\u201d",
      "In order to partially pay for the bill, Republicans opted to scale back Medicaid and food stamps. That includes instituting new work requirements for able-bodied adults, making undocumented immigrants ineligible for the program and putting new restrictions on the state provider tax, which is a significant source of revenue for rural hospitals.",
      "Moderate Republicans fended off even steeper cuts to Medicaid that had been in the mix during the negotiations, such as reducing the federal cost-sharing formula. But Valadao acknowledged he still harbors concerns over some of the Medicaid changes, particularly those impacting rural hospitals.",
      "Access to health care in rural areas can already be difficult. Often, facilities are dependent on help from the government to stay afloat. Kern Hospital in Bakersfield, a social safety net hospital, gets 72% of its patient revenue from Medi-Cal.",
      "Then there are rural health clinics, like the Bakersfield American Indian Health Project, where Garcia receives some of his care. These clinics rely on various revenue streams from the federal government and provide critical preventive care services to many low-income patients on Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no frills here. No one\u2019s taking advantage of anything. They\u2019re trying to survive,\u201d Dr. Carson Chambers, a clinical psychologist at the Bakersfield American Indian Health Project, told NBC News.",
      "Asked about the impacts of the Medicaid cuts, Chambers said: \u201cIt may be well-intentioned, it may be fiscally sound, but in the long run, I think it\u2019s going to cost more.\u201d"

    "summary": "As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, the Sanseito party and its leader Sohei Kamiya made gains on a \u201cJapanese first\u201d platform.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order titled \u201cSAVING COLLEGE SPORTS,\u201d a directive aimed at regulating the rapidly shifting landscape in college sports.",
      "Since 2021, college athletes have been able to profit off their name, image and likeness after a Supreme Court ruling on antitrust laws went in favor of the athletes. In the ensuing years, players have been able to get paid legally via third parties, and after a separate lawsuit was settled in June, athletes can now also be paid directly by their schools.",
      "The NIL era, however, has raised a variety of concerns for both schools and athletes, with issues ranging from maintaining equality in women\u2019s sports to a potential push for collective bargaining between athletes and their respective colleges.",
      "Trump\u2019s order, which is not itself a law, essentially calls for an implementation of policies that are widely viewed as NCAA (as opposed to athlete) friendly.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What exactly does Trump\u2019s order call for?",
      "Trump\u2019s order said that, in the wake of legislation that allows athletes to be compensated and transfer freely between schools, \u201cthe future of college sports is under unprecedented threat.\u201d",
      "The EO goes on to say that the recent rulings have unleashed \u201ca sea change that threatens the viability of college sports\u201d and more guardrails are needed to ensure a fairer system.",
      "So, what would Trump like to see? The order calls for the following:",
      "Prohibiting third parties from engaging in direct \u201cpay-for-play\u201d payments to athletes, which the order deems improper. Currently, school boosters can sign players to multimillion-dollar NIL deals that are widely viewed as a workaround to directly paying players to attend a certain university. Trump\u2019s order says players should only earn \u201cfair market value\u201d for a legitimate service to a third party, such as a brand endorsement. Advocates for athletes say this would impose a cap on their earnings.",

The NCAA has been lobbying for these protections for many years, as many of the big changes in college athletics have come as the result of antitrust lawsuits. Protections against further court cases would allow the NCAA to enforce its rules on issues such as transfers and third-party payments without fear of them being upended by another court ruling.",

      "What does this all mean for the immediate future?",
      "Nothing immediately.",
      "Trump cannot unilaterally impose rules in this scenario. His executive order also comes as the House tries to push through the SCORE Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that is aligned with much of Trump\u2019s executive order. The SCORE Act has moved through committee and can be debated on the House floor when representatives return from recess in September.",

      "\u201cThe many challenges facing college sports are important and complex,\u201d Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe Executive Order recognizes the importance of preserving Olympic sports, women\u2019s sports, and maintaining competitiveness for big and small schools alike. I\u2019m disappointed that the President abandoned his earlier plan for a commission to examine all the issues facing college sports. We need a sustainable future for college sports, not a future dominated by the biggest and wealthiest schools who can write their own rules without accountability.\u201d"

      "The former senior CIA officer who helped oversee the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election says Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and the White House are \u201clying\u201d when they claim that it was an attempt to sabotage President Donald Trump.",
      "Susan Miller, a retired CIA officer who helped lead the team that produced the report about Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 campaign, told NBC News it was based on credible information that showed Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, but that there was no sign of a conspiracy between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.",
      "\u201cThe director of national intelligence and the White House are lying, again,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe definitely had the intel to show with high probability that the specific goal of the Russians was to get Trump elected.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAt the same time, we found no two-way collusion between Trump or his team with the Russians at that time.\u201d",
      "Miller spoke to NBC News after Gabbard alleged Wednesday that the 2017 intelligence assessment was based on \u201cmanufactured\u201d information as part of a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d by the Obama administration to undermine Trump and tarnish his electoral victory. Gabbard cited a 2020 report from Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which she declassified and released this week, that asserted there was insufficient information to conclude Russia had been trying to tip the scales in favor of Trump.",
      "Miller said \u201cit is clear that Trump and his followers have a script they want to follow, despite the facts.\u201d",
      "She said that when her team briefed Trump and others about their assessment in 2017, they made clear there was no way to gauge the impact of the Russian information warfare on the vote, and that Trump was the country\u2019s lawful commander in chief.",
      "\u201cBoth me and my team readily acknowledged \u2014 to Trump and others in the USG [U.S. government] we briefed \u2014 that we could not say if this attempt by the Russians actually worked unless someone polled every single Trump voter to see if this disinformation was what led them to vote for Trump,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBoth my team and I and DCIA [the director of the CIA] said clearly in our report to Trump himself and to the intel committees [in Congress] that Trump was our president,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Trump thanked the CIA director for the briefing, Miller said.",
      "\u201cThat part was left out by Gabbard,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence dismissed Miller\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cSusan is wrong. And the American people can read for themselves hundreds of reasons why she is wrong in the declassified HPSCI report,\u201d said ODNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman, referring to the 2020 Republican House intelligence report.",
      "The Republican House report was emphatically rejected at the time by Democratic lawmakers on the panel. But a bipartisan Senate probe released the same year endorsed the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic party to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and bolster Trump\u2019s prospects. Trump\u2019s current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time and endorsed the conclusions of the panel\u2019s report.",
      "When asked about Miller\u2019s defense of the intelligence assessment, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: \u201cDirector Gabbard declassified documents in the name of transparency to show the world that the Obama administration was indeed behind the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Those who participated in criminal activity will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d",
      "In advance of the 2016 election, intelligence reporting indicated Russia was trying to influence the election with disinformation, Miller said. After the vote, John Brennan \u2014 who was CIA director at the time and is now a paid NBC News and MSNBC contributor \u2014 asked her to put together a task force that would rigorously examine Russia\u2019s role in the election.",
      "Miller, who served nine tours abroad with CIA during her 39-year career, was head of agency counterintelligence at the time. She said she put together a team with a range of skills and expertise, including analysts and officers working in counterintelligence.",
      "As they began their work on the assessment, Miller said, she and the rest of her team were keenly aware of the polarized political climate in the country in the aftermath of the election. They were facing pressure from officials both inside and outside the CIA.",
      "\u201cThere were people that hated Trump that wanted us to find that Trump was complicit. And there were those that loved Trump. They wanted us to find nothing. And we ignored all of it,\u201d Miller said.",
      "\u201cWe just kept ourselves neutral,\u201d she added. \u201cWe just decided to let the data speak for itself. ... We had very, very good data coming in.\u201d",
      "Brennan did not pressure or micromanage the task force, she said. Gabbard, current CIA Director John Ratcliffe and the White House have accused Brennan of fabricating intelligence about the 2016 election to undermine Trump. Brennan has rejected the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "The task force examined every possible angle, Miller said, including whether Trump and his campaign somehow conspired with the Kremlin to skew the election outcome. They did not find intelligence to support that scenario, she said.",
      "After sifting through all the intelligence and publicly available information, the team concluded that Russia had waged a large-scale information warfare campaign to undermine America\u2019s democratic process, damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and boost Trump\u2019s chances.",
      "\u201cThe paper was multiple pages long, but the summary of it is 100% they tried to influence the election, and 100% we can\u2019t say if it worked unless we polled every voter,\u201d Miller said.",
      "When the assessment was wrapping up and a draft was being edited, then-FBI Director James Comey asked that the report include a dossier about Trump by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, according to Miller and a Senate report from 2020, which cited accounts from multiple officials, including Comey and Brennan. The dossier featured unverified allegations about Trump that had not been corroborated by U.S. intelligence agencies, and CIA officials argued against adding references to the dossier in the report.",
      "\u201cWe had already written the paper and it was going through edits,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The FBI\u2019s stance annoyed Miller. Her view was that \u201cwe can\u2019t just shove this in\u201d to the assessment at such a late stage and that \u201cit\u2019s going to take us another six months to go and try to figure out if this is true,\u201d she said.",
      "But the FBI insisted that if the dossier were not included, the bureau would withdraw and not endorse the intelligence assessment, according to Miller. \u201cThe FBI said that \u2018unless you tag it onto the end of it, then we\u2019re not going to sign off on this,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In the end, the CIA and the FBI worked out a compromise. The dossier was included in an annex to the assessment, with a disclaimer that the claims in the file had not been verified by the intelligence community.",
      "Comey could not be reached for comment.",
      "Later on during the first Trump administration, Miller was called up to the general counsel\u2019s office at the CIA. There, she said, an agency lawyer told her she was facing possible criminal charges over her role leading the assessment.",
      "Miller assumed it was a joke. \u201cI laughed out loud.\u201d But it was not.",
      "Miller decided to hire a lawyer, though it was unclear what potential criminal charge was in play. The administration eventually used a special counsel, John Durham, to investigate how the previous administration had handled probes into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.",
      "Durham\u2019s team questioned Miller for hours. They asked her questions about whether she had an anti-Republican bias that influenced how the assessment was written, Miller said.",
      "\u201cI was answering questions like, \u2018Tell us how you hate all Republicans, and that\u2019s why you wrote this paper.\u2019 Actually, if you look at my registration, I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d",
      "Miller was never charged with any crime and she said she was never disciplined in any way over the intelligence assessment. She retired during the Biden administration after 39 years with the CIA.",
      "Earlier this month, Ratcliffe declassified an internal \u201clessons learned\u201d review looking at how the intelligence assessment was drafted. The internal review found that some standard procedures were not followed and that the report was rushed, but did not question the conclusions of the assessment.",
      "Miller said no one at the CIA contacted her for the internal review. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Nine years since the 2016 election, Russia is likely pleased to see yet more political acrimony in Washington over what transpired, according to Miller.",
      "\u201cPutin and his BFFs in the Kremlin are toasting vodka shots as we speak at the turmoil this is creating,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by the Palestinian militant group Hamas of U.S.-funded humanitarian supplies, challenging the main rationale that Israel and the U.S. give for backing a new armed private aid operation.",
      "The analysis, which has not been previously reported, was conducted by a bureau within the U.S. Agency for International Development and completed in late June. It examined 156 incidents of theft or loss of U.S.-funded supplies reported by U.S. aid partner organizations between October 2023 and this May.",
      "It found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies, according to a slide presentation of the findings seen by Reuters.",
      "A State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, saying there is video evidence of Hamas looting aid, but provided no such videos. The spokesperson also accused traditional humanitarian groups of covering up \u201caid corruption.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, questioned the existence of the analysis, saying no State Department official had seen it and that it \u201cwas likely produced by a deep state operative\u201d seeking to discredit President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian agenda.\u201d",
      "The findings were shared with the USAID\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office and State Department officials involved in Middle East policy, said two sources familiar with the matter, and come as dire food shortages deepen in the devastated enclave.",
      "Israel says it is committed to allowing in aid but must control it to prevent it from being stolen by Hamas, which it blames for the crisis.",
      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."

      "\u201cSometimes, the children would be there, tied to a pole that was there, bound to a bed that was there, or in a chair that was there,\u201d Wade said. \u201cSometimes, there would be multiple people that would come by and victimize these children on a nightly basis.\u201d",
      "An image of the inside of the bunker, released by the sheriff\u2019s office, showed a filthy mattress in a corner, a folding chair and a fan.",

      "An animal shock collar was used to punish the children, according to complaints obtained by NBC News affiliate WVTM of Birmingham.",
      "Wade said the suspects include relatives of some of the 10 alleged victims, who range in age from 3 to 15.",
      "The children are in the custody of the state, said Robert H. Turner, Jr., the district attorney for the 4th Judicial Circuit of Alabama.",
      "The sheriff said the operation appears to have come together about 2022, and that officials began investigating in February after state child welfare officials alerted Bibb County authorities to the possibility of abuse at a home near the bunker.  The children did not live in the bunker, the sheriff said.",
      "Wade said a drug trafficking investigation at the location may have delayed the sex trafficking case.",

      "\u201cTesla is not allowed to test or transport the public (paid or unpaid) in an AV with or without a driver,\u201d the California Public Utilities Commission told CNBC in an email on Friday. \u201cTesla is allowed to transport the public (paid or unpaid) in a non-AV, which, of course, would have a driver.\u201d",
      "In other words, Tesla\u2019s service in the state will have to be more taxi than robot.",
      "Tesla has what\u2019s known in California as a charter-party carrier permit, which allows it to run a private car service with human drivers, similar to limousine companies or sightseeing services.",
      "The commission said it received a notification from Tesla on Thursday that the company plans to \u201cextend operations\u201d under its permit to \u201coffer service to friends and family of employees and to select members of the public,\u201d across much of the Bay Area.",
      "But under Tesla\u2019s permit, that service can only be with non-AVs, the CPUC said.",
      "The California Department of Motor Vehicles told CNBC that Tesla has had a \u201cdrivered testing permit\u201d since 2014, allowing the company to operate AVs with a safety driver present, but not to collect fees. The safety drivers must be Tesla employees, contractors or designees of the manufacturer under that permit, the DMV said.",
      "In Austin, Texas, Tesla is currently testing out a robotaxi service, using its Model Y SUVs equipped with the company\u2019s latest automated driving software and hardware. The limited service operates during daylight hours and in good weather, on roads with a speed limit of 40 miles per hour.",
      "Robotaxis in Austin are remotely supervised by Tesla employees and include a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat. The service is now limited to invited users, who agree to the terms of Tesla\u2019s \u201cearly access program.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Business Insider, citing an internal Tesla memo, reported that Tesla told staff it planned to expand its robotaxi service to the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend. Tesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on that report.",
      "In a separate matter in California, the DMV has accused Tesla of misleading consumers about the capabilities of its driver assistance systems, previously marketed under the names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (or FSD).",
      "Tesla now calls its premium driver assistance features, \u201cFSD Supervised.\u201d In owners manuals, Tesla says Autopilot and FSD Supervised are \u201chands on\u201d systems, requiring a driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at all times.",
      "But in user-generated videos shared by Tesla on X, the company shows customers using FSD hands-free while engaged in other tasks. The DMV is arguing that Tesla\u2019s license to sell vehicles in California should be suspended, with arguments ongoing through Friday at the state\u2019s Office of Administrative Hearings in Oakland.",
      "Under California state law, autonomous taxi services are regulated at the state level. Some city and county officials said on Friday that they were out of the loop regarding a potential Tesla service in the state.",
      "Stephanie Moulton-Peters, a member of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, said in a phone interview that she had not heard from Tesla about its plans. She urged the company to be more transparent.",
      "\u201cI certainly expect they will tell us and I think it\u2019s a good business practice to do that,\u201d she said.",
      "Moulton-Peters said she was undecided on robotaxis generally and wasn\u2019t sure how Marin County, located north of San Francisco, would react to Tesla\u2019s service.",
      "\u201cThe news of change coming always has mixed results in the community,\u201d she said.",
      "Brian Colbert, another member of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that he\u2019s open to the idea of Tesla\u2019s service being a good thing but that he was disappointed in the lack of communication.",
      "\u201cThey should have done a better job about informing the community about the launch,\u201d he said.",
      "Google spinoff Waymo, which is far ahead of Tesla in the robotaxi market, obtained a number of permits from the DMV and CPUC before starting its driverless ride-hailing service in the state.",
      "Waymo was granted a CPUC driverless deployment permit in 2023, allowing it to charge for rides in the state. The company has been seeking amendments to both its DMV and CPUC driverless deployment permits as it expands its service territory in the state."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump administration that sought to block the enforcement of several \"sanctuary policies\" in Illinois that restrict the ability of local officials to aid federal immigration authorities in detainment operations.",
      "In a 64-page decision, U.S. District Judge Lindsay C. Jenkins, a Joe Biden appointee, granted a motion by the state of Illinois to dismiss the case after determining the United States lacks standing to sue over the sanctuary policies.",
      "The judge said in the ruling that Illinois' decision to enact the sanctuary laws is protected by the 10th Amendment, which declares that any powers not specifically given to the federal government or denied to the states by the Constitution are retained by the states.",
      "\u201cThe Sanctuary Policies reflect Defendants\u2019 decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law \u2014 a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted by the [Immigration and Nationality Act],\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cBecause the Tenth Amendment protects Defendants\u2019 Sanctuary Policies, those Policies cannot be found to discriminate against or regulate the federal government.\u201d",
      "The federal judge wrote that granting the administration's request would create an \"end-run around the Tenth Amendment.\"",
      "\u201cIt would allow the federal government to commandeer States under the guise of intergovernmental immunity \u2014 the exact type of direct regulation of states barred by the Tenth Amendment.\u201d",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker praised the dismissal, which he said will ensure state law enforcement is \"not carrying out the Trump administration's unlawful policies or troubling tactics.\"",
      "\"As state law allows, Illinois will assist the federal government when they follow the law and present warrants to hold violent criminals accountable. But what Illinois will not do is participate in the Trump administration\u2019s violations of the law and abuses of power,\" Pritzker said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Trump Justice Department sued the state of Illinois and Cook County, the home of Chicago, in February over policies it argued infringed on the ability of federal authorities to enforce immigration laws, the first lawsuit by the administration aimed specifically at \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" a label applied to states, cities, counties or municipalities that establish laws to prevent or limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.",
      "In the 22-page lawsuit, filed days after Attorney General Pam Bondi was confirmed by the Senate, the Justice Department sought to block state, city and county ordinances that prohibit local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement absent a criminal warrant. Bondi said the policies \"obstruct\" the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe challenged provisions of Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County law reflect their intentional effort to obstruct the Federal Government\u2019s enforcement of federal immigration law and to impede consultation and communication between federal, state, and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for federal officials to carry out federal immigration law and keep Americans safe,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The administration has taken similar action to target sanctuary jurisdictions across the country, including a lawsuit this week against New York City, which was described by the Justice Department as \u201cthe vanguard of interfering with enforcing this country\u2019s immigration laws\u201d in a complaint filed Thursday. The administration filed a separate lawsuit targeting New York state in February over it\u2019s \u201cGreen Light Law,\u201d which enables undocumented immigrants to apply for noncommercial driver\u2019s licenses and bars state officials from turning over that data to federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Justice Department in June filed a complaint against Los Angeles for immigration policies it argued interfere and discriminate against federal immigration agents by treating them differently from other law enforcement agents in the state. The suit came as Trump administration officials increasingly sparred with California\u2019s Democratic leaders after immigration detainment efforts in the state led to clashes between protesters and federal authorities, and led the administration to deploy thousands of National Guard troops.",
      "In January, Trump signed an executive order directing Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \u201cdo not receive access to federal funds\u201d and to consider pursuing criminal or civil penalties if localities \u201cinterfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\u201d",
      "A federal judge in April blocked the effort to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions, finding that Trump\u2019s order violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers principles. That judge blocked an earlier effort by Trump in 2017."

    "story": [
      "Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.",
      "\u201cContinental drying\u201d has redirected the planet\u2019s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.",
      "Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world\u2019s richest agricultural regions.",
      "\u201cWe use a lot of water to grow food,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. \u201cIf things don\u2019t change, we\u2019ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.\u201d",
      "The findings \u201cshould be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,\u201d the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends \u201csend perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth\u2019s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.",
      "The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth\u2019s water, including changes to the planet\u2019s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.",
      "The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.",
      "In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected \u201cmega-drying\u201d regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.",
      "\u201cThe key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,\u201d said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.",
      "The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.",
      "Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.",
      "Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.",
      "The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet\u2019s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent \u2014 or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.",
      "\u201cIf you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cWater goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.",
      "Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.",
      "\u201cThis kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can track that water, if we know where it\u2019s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.\u201d"

At the time, task force members weren\u2019t given a reason for the cancellation or whether the meeting would be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s plans were first reported Friday by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The task force plays an important role in protecting access to screenings and tests because the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, mandates that most private insurers provide the services that the group recommends to patients at no cost.",
      "The task force makes its recommendations using a grading scale. Under federal law, services that get an A or B grade but must be covered by insurance plans at no cost for patients.",
      "The advisory group has come under fire from conservative groups for some past decisions, including its \u201cA\u201d recommendation to cover the HIV prevention pill, known as PrEP.",
      "That recommendation led to a lawsuit from several Christian employers that ended up before the Supreme Court, where the justices decided 6-3 to uphold the Affordable Care Act provision that requires insurers to cover task force-recommended preventive services for free. However, the court agreed with the Trump administration that Kennedy has final say over decisions made by members of the task force because HHS has oversight over the group. As health secretary, he also has the authority to remove and replace members.",
      "Kennedy has made children\u2019s chronic disease a keystone of his position as the country\u2019s top health official. It\u2019s unclear which areas of health care Kennedy might target by shaking up the panel.",

The new panel includes well-known vaccine critics."

I feel like both of the shows that I\u2019m in I got very lucky with the cast and the crew. \u201cAdults\u201d I didn\u2019t know anyone when I started, but they\u2019ve become my best friends, and \u201cOvercompensating,\u201d I knew Benny really well, and he was already my best friend. So it\u2019s just working with friends, which I think you always hear about, but it rarely happens.",
      "'Overcompensating' has been celebrated for embracing millennial culture, whereas 'Adults' has been billed as for Gen Z. Which generation do you identify with?",
      "Well, I\u2019m a cusper. I\u2019m an honest, true cusper. I remember watching \u201cGirls\u201d and being like, \u201cThis is me.\u201d And then now I\u2019m watching TikToks of these 19 year olds, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s totally me.\u201d So I feel like I can kind of straddle both worlds.",
      "How would you sum up the difference between the generations' styles of humor?",
      "I think \u201cOvercompensating\u201d is in the world of \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d these movies that we loved growing up, which just feel fun and camp. It\u2019s so relatable. I dropped out of college after two weeks ... but even still, I was like, \u201cI know a Hailee. I know a Grace.\u201d I knew every character. I feel like the humor is really based in relatability.",
      "And with \u201cAdults,\u201d what I think they do so brilliantly is they take from the Gen Z sensibility of ... it\u2019s just joke after joke. I feel like now with TikTok, we\u2019re so used to this fast paced, joke-after-joke lifestyle. I remember watching a TikTok the other day and it was a minute long. The joke didn\u2019t come until the end and I was like, \u201cThis is so boring.\u201d I\u2019m so used to, like, 10 seconds in there\u2019ll be a joke, 20 seconds in, another.",
      "On your TikTok, you've engaged a lot with fans of the show. What was your approach to putting Anton into your social media?",
      "For me, I think what was fun about the social media aspect is, a lot of who I am as a person is also in Anton. So it was really fun to even just post something that Owen would post and people would be like, \u201cThis is so Anton.\u201d I was like, is that a compliment? Are you roasting me, or are you being super nice?",
      "People have really taken to the Anton and Paul Baker plot line, which I think is so beautiful. It\u2019s so cheesy to say this but it really makes me feel like, \u201cOh, people love, love. Love wins.\u201d",
      "Also, it\u2019s so fun to tease because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next season. On my own TikTok, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, what if this happened?\u201d Then I see the reaction and I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, that can\u2019t happen because everyone hated that TikTok.\u201d I feel like the creators, too, are learning from the way that we have our own special communication with the people watching it. And it feels like we\u2019re just all in a friend group. They\u2019re like, \u201cWait, Issa (Amita Rao) needs a girlfriend in Season 2!\u201d And (creators) Ben (Kronengold) and Rebecca (Shaw) are so brilliant, I feel like they will hear that and take the people watching opinions, because it matters.",
      "Does your phone look like Anton's?",
      "So this is what happened. I'm just gonna tell you it straight. (Laughs). So Episode 1, the pilot, when I auditioned, Anton was struggling with dating as he is in the season, but he was a little more emotionally reserved and a little more cutting. Then as we built this character together, they kind of infused a little bit of my people-pleasing aspects into Anton. So then it became a mix of what they had brilliantly written before, and also a little bit of Owen as well \u2014 I just used my name in the third person ... I cannot believe I just did it.",
      "But yeah, they infuse Anton with me. For instance, the phone episode is very me to the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone. We didn\u2019t, thank God. But yes, if you look at my phone, it\u2019s like, \u201cCar Accident No. 4,\u201d like, \u201cGray Socks Guy From Bar.\u201d",
      "Right now I have probably 2,000 unread text messages. But I would like to say that my mother is worse than me and meets people on the street and puts me in group chats with random people. So that's why I have so many unread texts, because my mom will go to a 7-Eleven, meet someone and put me in a group chat with this person and all of his family.",
      "\"Adults\" opens with Issa's boyfriend, the Canadian, sexually fluid Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), moving into the house. He and Anton strike up a close friendship. In the season's finale, Paul Baker learns his visa's expiring, so Issa proposes. After she gets cold feet, their other housemates Samir (Malik Elassal) and Billie (Lucy Freyer) also offer to marry him.",
      "The final scene reveals that Paul Baker and Anton got married. At their roommates' urging, they share a kiss that turns more than platonic. But before anyone can react, the power goes out.",
      "I want to talk about the ending. At the civil wedding ceremony, did Anton volunteer to marry Paul Baker, or did Paul Baker ask Anton to marry him at that moment?",
      "I don't know why, I just got a full chill down my spine. I felt like Anton in this moment.",
      "I probably think, based on who Anton is \u2014 a little more emotionally reserved, emotionally stunted and scared of love \u2014\u00a0I don't think he volunteered. But I think he was so beyond happy when he was asked. That's what I would say.",
      "What has your experience been diving into this fandom?",
      "We'll do anything to make people watch the show. We love it so much that we're like, we will literally read fan fiction if you just turn on the TV. It's been amazing because it feels like everyone watching it and everyone interacting with us online are loving these characters and the stories as much as we did when we were making it. It feels like we\u2019re a little community of people... a group of people that I would get along with.",
      "I love reading all of people\u2019s theories about Paul Baker and Anton, or Samir and Billie, or what Issa is going to do. I\u2019ve never been on a television show that has that. I feel so lucky to be a part of it because I\u2019ve been on the other end for so many shows like that, where I was secretly on my finsta (\u201cfake Instagram,\u201d or a secondary social media account), writing comments about what would happen in the next season of whatever show I\u2019m talking about.",
      "So you were a fan of ship culture?",
      "I love ship culture. (Laughs). I love it. \u201cNew Girl\u201d was a big one for me. Nick and Jess, I was shipping. There\u2019s been so many. I remember re-watching \u201cFriends\u201d during COVID. And I was like, \u201cOh my God. I love Rachel and Ross.\u201d I love a sitcom ship, I really do.",
      "After that kiss, after they deal with the power going out, what happens next?",
      "Here's my theory, and I've never really said this, and maybe I'll get absolutely killed for saying it, but I think they're all going to make it through.",
      "I think Issa and Anton have such a beautiful friendship, and Amita and I actually have mimicked that in real life. We actually are the best of friends. She's gonna be a bridesmaid in my wedding, like, that's the kind of friend she's become to me. So I do feel like, if that happened in real life with Amita and I, we would make it through. I probably wouldn't do it, but we would make it through. So I think everything's gonna be OK, but I do think, of course, there will be some hiccups.",
      "We know Paul Baker has expressed that he thinks Anton's 'the coolest person in the world.' How does Anton view Paul Baker?",
      "I think Anton has finally found someone who he connects to on a level that he's been searching for. But it is just so scary that that person is your best friend's boyfriend.",
      "So I think either this will change him for the better. Maybe he will be more vocal about his feelings, or this will set him back 20 more years. He will never say anything again. Let's hope for the first.",
      "While releasing \u201cOvercompensating\u201d and \u201cAdults,\u201d Thiele has also been working on his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d about his relationship with his parents, who adopted him. The show includes executive producer Ilana Glazer.",
      "Per The Hollywood Reporter, the logline reads, \u201cHe\u2019s gay and Black, they\u2019re all Jewish, his mom should be on \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 and his cousin\u2019s a former party girl turned Rabbi-in-training. The comedy is about a son who doesn\u2019t want to grow up, a mother who has no intention of letting him, and a dad who\u2019s probably faking a nap in the other room so he doesn\u2019t have to engage.\u201d",
      "How is the development of 'Off Color' going?",
      "We are chugging along. Our little team, all these people that I\u2019ve looked up to for so long; Kent Alterman and Sarah Babineau were the heads of Comedy Central who greenlit my favorite shows ever, \u201cBroad City\u201d included. And then Ilana, who is a comedy legend and one of my deepest and biggest role models. So it kind of feels crazy to just even work with them.",
      "So we're chugging along, and hopefully something will happen soon.",
      "Thinking of the premise of 'Off Color,' how do you approach putting yourself into a role? Is it natural for you?",
      "Yeah, it is natural \u2014 because I\u2019m such a narcissist. No, no, but it is natural. What\u2019s so funny about writing about my family is that my family is so beautifully insane. I\u2019ll write something and Ilana will read it and be like, \u201cOh, this could not happen.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no, it just happened two minutes ago, which is why I\u2019m texting you. ... My mother really did this in the grocery store.\u201d",
      "That's why it's so fun, because it feels like family therapy. It feels like I'm journaling about the craziest things that my parents could do. But somehow it's all real."

      "But I loved \u201cMentiras\u201d because it was a great challenge for me, not only as an actor, because this character has a wide range, but because it\u2019s just me in a room with three incredible actresses and Luis Gerardo.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: She was holding her own alongside Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, Regina Bland\u00f3n and Diana Bovio, who are masters of comedy. I think the great surprise was that Beli is not only an extraordinary singer and actor, which we knew, but she\u2019s very funny and she can do comedy very well.",
      "One thing that has done very well is the soundtrack. People have been obsessed with it.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would turn out so good, but it did. It\u2019s been crazy. The songs have millions of streams on Spotify.",
      "We had a feeling that it was going to work out but the response has been very overwhelming and kind, and we are very grateful because no one imagined it.",
      "Was there ever any pressure to re-create these iconic songs?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: I never thought about that. I never thought about being nervous or needing to be at the same level as (singers) Mijares or Emmanuel, because I knew I was never going to be them.",
      "These characters are singing about something very specific that they are going through at that moment. The great thing about \"Mentiras\" is the characters don't sing just to sing. The characters sing so that the story advances. When the character can't express what they are feeling with words, they start to sing. So it\u2019s not me singing like Mijares, it\u2019s me singing as my character Emmanuel. It\u2019s not Belinda singing like Amanda Miguel, it\u2019s Belinda singing as Daniela. And Belinda did brilliant things with her songs, like \u201cDe Color De Rosa.\u201d",
      "Was it always the plan to make the show look like a play and not like a television show?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: We always want to pay homage to theater and wanted it to feel very theatrical. The references we had when creating the show were \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d \u201cLa La Land\u201d and even \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "But we also didn't want it to be like we just filmed the original musical. We wanted to have that essence, though. Antonio Mu\u00f1o-Hierro, the production designer, had this brilliant idea. He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the series called? It\u2019s called \u2018Mentiras\u2019 (\u2018Lies\u2019)\u2019. So let\u2019s show viewers that everything is a lie. That the sets are also fake.\u2019\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there\u2019s these moments when (surprise guest) Daniela Romo says, \u201cEverything is a lie,\u201d and pushes the house down and you see that you\u2019re in the Mijares household, but behind that is Daniela\u2019s house. For me, that was beautiful. I grew up in the world of musical theater, and it\u2019s a love letter to theater, and that\u2019s what makes it so visually stunning.",
      "Belinda: It's incredibly well made. It had a large budget for the sets, everything in general was well-designed, the aesthetic, cinematography, every detail was outstanding.",
      "I think it will set a precedent, and people will be like, \u201cLet\u2019s make a series like \u2018Mentiras.\u2019\u201d It will be the example for many other people, and that\u2019s what\u2019s incredible."

      "\u201cI can\u2019t give you any more than I have,\" Carrie said. \"And it wasn\u2019t enough. And there's all the family stuff. I'm sorry but there is.\"",

      "\"That was always ringing in my ears as a challenge,\" she added.",

      "Known as the \u201cNicki Minaj challenge,\u201d this viral moment is an elaborate balancing act. The challenge has taken over the internet, as the hashtag #nickiminajchallenge has been used over 115,000 times on TikTok alone.",
      "Creators have balanced on everything from Jenga blocks to soup cans. Many have found their own humorous, if not outrageous, ways to embrace the challenge and make it their own. Some have ridden on their kids' play cars while remaining in the pose, while others have used their pets to get in on the action.",
      "As the trend grows in popularity, some are wondering how it all started, and is it safe? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Nicki Minaj challenge.",
      "Where Did the Nicki Minaj Challenge Come From?",
      "The trend is inspired by rapper Nicki Minaj\u2019s famous pose in the music video for the 2013 song \u201cHigh School\u201d ft. Lil Wayne. At the video\u2019s 34 second mark, Minaj stands by a swimming pool in stilettos, crouching low to the ground with one leg crossed over the other.",
      "In April, TikTok user @1jacore posted a video attempting to emulate Minaj. Since then, others followed suit, with many getting creative as they tried to channel the singer's impressive posture.",
      "Now, the trend has evolved beyond just completing Minaj\u2019s original pose. Users have taken the challenge to new heights, balancing on as many objects as possible, all while wearing a pair of high heels. The trend also appears to have become somewhat competitive, with some participants seemingly attempting to outdo one another with the most elaborate balancing act.",
      "For example, one user posted a video of herself on TikTok balancing on a tall stack of tables in her garden. In the video, she holds a hose in one hand and balances on an upside down flowerpot while in a pair of heels.",
      "Users have also recorded themselves balancing on champagne bottles, cakes and weights.",
      "On TODAY with Jenna & Friends July 24, Jenna Bush Hager and Willie Geist both attempted the trend. Jenna completed the pose on a stack of books with her July book club pick in hand and a pair of sunglasses on. Willie fulfilled the challenge by balancing on top of ceramic coffee mugs with a margarita in hand.",
      "Some attempts at the trend seem to defy physics and gravity. But as participants try to create the craziest take on the trend yet, they should also consider the safety implications behind completing such a stunt.",
      "Is the Nicki Minaj Challenge Safe?",
      "TODAY fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour tells TODAY.com that the Nicki Minaj challenge can be unsafe if the proper precautions are not taken.",
      "\u201cI never recommend working out in heels or balancing on one foot in heels, unless wearing them is part of the artistic nature of a workout,\u201d Mansour says.",
      "Balancing on unstable objects is risky, she adds. If the proper precautions are not taken, this challenge could be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "While the challenge is still sweeping social media, Mansour offers her sobering take on whether fans should try to take it on.",
      "\u201cI hate to be the bearer of bad news over a fun TikTok trend,\u201d Mansour says, \u201cbut I really don\u2019t recommend that anyone seriously try this.\u201d",
      "How to Safely do the Nicki Minaj Challenge",
      "Even though the Nicki Minaj challenge is not \"recommended,\" there's still hope for those who want to join in on the fun. There are ways to safely complete the challenge and doing it might even have some benefits.",
      "Mansour says balancing workouts can be a great exercise to build strength.",
      "\u201cThis could be a great exercise to strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, quads, calf and the stabilizing muscles, tendons and ligaments surrounding your ankle, knee and hip joints,\u201d Mansour says, referring to the challenge.",
      "To complete the trend safely, Mansour recommends balancing on a stable surface, such as a level stack of books. She also says participants should make sure that what they are balancing on is wide enough, which will help them from tipping over.",
      "She says it also would be helpful to have past experience balancing on one foot on surfaces that are not elevated.",
      "After you have the right surface to balance on, and wear a pair of workout shoes, your risk of injury is lower.",
      "Now, all that's left for you to do is bring your own personality to the trend and see what creative items you can grab to feature in your pose."

      "For the new superhero flick, which hit theaters July 25, Pedro Pascal steps into the role of Reed Richards while Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm. Completing the family are Joseph Quinn\u2019s Johnny Storm, Sue\u2019s brother, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach\u2019s character Ben Grimm, Reed\u2019s close friend.",
      "Straying from the early 2000s \u201cFantastic Four\u201d films and the widely panned 2015 reboot, this time comic book fans meet Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben on Earth-828 circa the early 1960s, as evident by the movie\u2019s glossy retro-futuristic style.",
      "The film breezes past the characters\u2019 origin stories, showing in flashbacks how their previous trip to space resulted in them returning to Earth with superpowers. But the beloved heroes of this world are rattled when one day the Silver Surfer, played by Julia Garner, descends from the sky and announces to the quartet, and the world, that their planet is marked for death. She tells them that Earth will be consumed by a colossal being known as Galactus, voiced by Ralph Ineson.",

Galactus had asked the couple to sacrifice their child to him and in exchange he would leave their planet alone. He reveals that Franklin has special abilities that would eliminate the giant\u2019s insatiable hunger, even though Reed\u2019s multiple tests appeared to confirm the baby lacked superpowers.",
      "Instead of giving into Galactus\u2019 demand, the quartet outsmart him by luring the entity into a trap. However, the plan goes awry and Sue has to use all her strength to create a force field strong enough to push Galactus into a portal that sends him to a far part of the galaxy.",
      "Sue dies but when Reed places Franklin on top of her, the boy suddenly revives her.",

Sue finishes reading a book to Franklin in the Fantastic Four\u2019s penthouse apartment, located at the Baxter Building, before she goes into another room to grab a second novel.",
      "When she returns to the living room, she senses something is wrong and spots Doctor Doom leaning over the child. Although the villain has his mask removed in the scene and holds it in his hand, his face is not shown. Marvel has previously announced that Robert Downey Jr., who portrayed Iron Man, will re-join the MCU as Doctor Doom.",
      "The flick then cuts to a black screen with text that reads, \u201cThe Fantastic Four will return in \u2018Avengers: Doomsday.\u2019\u201d",
      "Once all the credits conclude, the film officially ends with a snippet from the 1967 \u201cFantastic Four\u201d cartoon. There is also a quote from Jack Kirby, who co-created the Fantastic Four with the late Stan Lee, as well as many other comic book characters prior to his death in 1994. The quote from Kirby says, \u201cIf you look at my characters, you will find me. No matter what kind of character you create or assume, a little of yourself must remain there.\u201d",
      "How does the post-credit scene impact \u2018Avengers: Doomsday\u2019?",
      "Doctor Doom finally making an appearance in a Marvel film isn\u2019t that surprising given that he will be the main \u201cBig Bad\u201d for this phase of the MCU and that he is one of the Fantastic Four\u2019s biggest adversaries. Plus, Pascal, Kirby, Quinn and Moss-Bachrach were previously announced as \u201cAvengers: Doomsday\u201d cast members in March.",
      "However, as mentioned, \u201cFirst Steps\u201d is set in the 1960s, decades before the timelines of Marvel\u2019s other films this year, like \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and \u201cThunderbolts*.\u201d So, Doctor Doom popping up in this movie could suggest there will be some type of time travel element at the center of \u201cAvengers: Doomsday.\u201d",

    "summary": "As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, the Sanseito party and its leader Sohei Kamiya made gains on a \u201cJapanese first\u201d platform.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by the Palestinian militant group Hamas of U.S.-funded humanitarian supplies, challenging the main rationale that Israel and the U.S. give for backing a new armed private aid operation.",
      "The analysis, which has not been previously reported, was conducted by a bureau within the U.S. Agency for International Development and completed in late June. It examined 156 incidents of theft or loss of U.S.-funded supplies reported by U.S. aid partner organizations between October 2023 and this May.",
      "It found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies, according to a slide presentation of the findings seen by Reuters.",
      "A State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, saying there is video evidence of Hamas looting aid, but provided no such videos. The spokesperson also accused traditional humanitarian groups of covering up \u201caid corruption.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, questioned the existence of the analysis, saying no State Department official had seen it and that it \u201cwas likely produced by a deep state operative\u201d seeking to discredit President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian agenda.\u201d",
      "The findings were shared with the USAID\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office and State Department officials involved in Middle East policy, said two sources familiar with the matter, and come as dire food shortages deepen in the devastated enclave.",
      "Israel says it is committed to allowing in aid but must control it to prevent it from being stolen by Hamas, which it blames for the crisis.",
      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."

      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",

      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013. Thailand rejects the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
      "The temple\u2019s listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008 prompted another flare-up.",
      "Tensions have been building again since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed after both sides opened fire in another contested area where the two meet with Laos, called the Emerald Triangle. Then Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were injured in a land mine explosion along the border, which kicked off the latest clash. Cambodia denies placing land mines.",
      "A series of tit-for-tat moves followed, including both countries expelling each other\u2019s diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe two sides are now at the point of almost no return,\u201d Pou Sothirak, a former Cambodian ambassador to Japan and a distinguished senior adviser to the Cambodian Center for Regional Studies in Phnom Penh, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve locked into this \u2018we\u2019re the victim and you\u2019re the aggressor\u2019 narrative,\u201d he said.",
      "Political fallout",
      "The dispute has set off political turmoil in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended early this month after an extraordinary leak of her phone call with Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades as effectively a one-party state before handing power to his son Hun Manet two years ago.",
      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen. She has said she was trying to defuse the border dispute in the call, during which she referred to Hun Sen as \u201cuncle.\u201d",
      "The conversation, recorded and released by Hun Sen himself, prompted outrage in Thailand, where there was already widespread dissatisfaction with her handling of the border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn also blasted a Thai army commander during the call, angering an institution that has frequently intervened in the country\u2019s politics, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe have a situation today in which the Thai military is making its own foreign policy against Cambodia. The Thai civilian government has no control over the army at all,\u201d said Paul Wesley Chambers, a visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s free for all and really out of control,\u201d he said of the situation this week, adding that the conflict could topple Phumtham.",
      "Cambodia said it had urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene in Thailand\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and premeditated military aggression.\u201d Thailand says it wants to resolve the conflict bilaterally, but only after Cambodia ceases its attacks.",
      "Neighboring China has offered mediation, but it is seen as closer to the government in Phnom Penh than Bangkok.",
      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",
      "\u201cThe Thai military pre-emptively pressures conflicts,\u201d he said."

      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",

That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",

      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",
      "But even with all the responsibilities of being a trailblazer, he\u2019s keeping his eyes on the prize.",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",
      "Aug. 1 is the latest deadline Trump has imposed on countries to make deals to avoid tariff rates that Trump himself had set in dozens of letters he fired off on social media. Even though that deadline had been delayed before, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that it was a \u201cpretty hard deadline.\u201d",
      "Since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day on April 2, the administration has yet to strike any formal trade deals, instead signing a handful of framework deals that can be turned into fully fledged deals later.",
      "Japan has been furiously trying to avoid as much of a hit from Trump\u2019s global tariffs as possible. Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator has visited the United States at least eight times, most recently Monday, when he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for more than two hours.",
      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "Trump touted the announcement at an event with congressional Republicans later Tuesday, saying the tariffs \u201ckicked in better than anybody other than me and a few of the people in the room thought could happen.\u201d",
      "He added that Japan would form a joint venture with the United States related to liquefied natural gas in Alaska.",
      "Japan was the fifth-biggest source of U.S. imports last year, with American consumers and companies buying nearly $150 billion of goods from the country, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "The talks came at a tough time politically for Ishiba, whose Liberal Democratic Party recently lost both houses of parliament. Ishiba pledged to stay on as leader, in part to address economic headwinds.",
      "Trump had recently downplayed the chances of an agreement with Japan.",
      "\u201cThe Japanese are tough, but ultimately you have to understand we\u2019re just going to send a letter saying, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to pay, otherwise you don\u2019t have to do business with us.\u2019 But there\u2019s a chance,\u201d he said June 16.",
      "In May, Trump approved a long-delayed takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel. As part of the deal, Nippon agreed to create at least 70,000 jobs through a $14 billion investment, according to both companies and the White House. The companies later upped that to 100,000 jobs but clarified that the additions included \u201cdirect, indirect, and induced jobs.\u201d"

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"
