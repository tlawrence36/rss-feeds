      "ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E",
      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "Trump, Stephanopoulos and ABC executives signed the settlement agreement on Friday.",
      "The document bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge and Miss Havisham were among the characters at hand, mingling with chimney sweepers, livestock and Christmas carol singers in Deventer\u2019s historic center. Onlookers bowed when Queen Victoria passed through.",
      "Merchants peddle antiques and gingerbread, while people portraying pickpockets try to avoid being tossed in a mock Marshalsea Prison.",

Strik and other shopowners dressed up in the 19th-century England costumes and walked out on the streets. The protest evolved into an annual festival and Strik, now 84, has collected more than 1,000 Dickensian costumes for the event.",

      "A woman who has accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 13 at an awards show after-party has acknowledged inconsistencies in her story",
      "A woman who accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 13 at an awards show after-party has acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story, while her lawyer said he will continue to vet her claims.",
      "The unnamed woman described being driven from Rochester, New York, to New York City for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000 and then Combs\u2019 limo driver offering her a ride to an after-party, NBC News reported on Friday. She claimed she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault.",
      "But a representative of the Maddens confirmed to NBC that they were on tour in the Midwest during the VMAs, while her father said he doesn\u2019t remember the drive home of more than five hours. The woman\u2019s friend who reportedly drove her to the awards has since died, NBC reported.",
      "The woman had first sued Combs, alleging she was raped at an after-party, and then amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, also was at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z said in a statement that the article proves Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame.",
      "\u201cThis incident didn\u2019t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn\u2019t realize it yet, but, soon.\u201d",
      "Buzbee told The Associated in an email that if someone raises a new issue which didn\u2019t previously exist, his legal team's job is to continue collecting facts and evidence.",
      "Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, asked the court to dismiss the case, saying in a statement, \u201cIt is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press.\u201d",
      "The woman admitted to making \u201csome mistakes\u201d when recalling that night, but said she stands by her allegations.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Teny R. Geragos, said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cYesterday, a lawyer admitted that over 50 people falsely claimed to be victims. Today, for the second time this week, a Buzbee plaintiff has been exposed. This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The unnamed woman said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said Combs and Jay-Z then barged into the room, along with another unnamed celebrity, and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",
      "Jay-Z, a 24-time Grammy award winning rapper, producer and music mogul, anonymously sued Buzbee last month, alleging he was attempting to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Jay-Z said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement, which had the \u201copposite effect\u201d on him.",
      "Buzbee previously said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is \u201cstupid and laughable\u201d and his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation.",
      "Buzbee announced at a news conference in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "His firm, which has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers, began filing a wave of lawsuits against the hip-hop mogul a few weeks later.",
      "Combs was denied bail a third time last month. He has pleaded not guilty to charges he coerced and abused women for years and faces trial in May.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out,\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d",
      "While frequently photographed together at events, they also have been business competitors. Diddy launched his Bad Boy Records around the same time Jay-Z launched his Roc-A-Fella record label."

      "NEW DELHI -- A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month.",
      "A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun\u2019s release for \u201cPushpa 2: The Rule\u201d in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on Dec. 4.",
      "Arjun was arrested after the woman\u2019s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor\u2019s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater\u2019s management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",
      "Police have already arrested the theater\u2019s owner and two of his employees in connection with the case.",
      "A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported.",
      "The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater\u2019s main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede.",
      "The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was \u201cheartbroken by the tragic incident.\u201d He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman\u2019s family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son.",

      "\u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia\u2019s decades-long cinema ban",
      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different \u2014 and the star of \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d now has an award.",
      "Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award \u2014 and the glitzy festival itself \u2014 is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry.",
      "\u201cMy heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,\u201d Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. \u201cI used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.\u201d",
      "The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training.",
      "The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom\u2019s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world\u2019s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman \u201chas really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don\u2019t see the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens \u2014 by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.)",
      "The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring.",
      "\u201cThese facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,\u201d said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. \u201cToday, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, \u2018I cannot implement my imagination.\u2019\u201d",
      "The facilities are one part of the equation \u2014 the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues.",
      "In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in \u201cMandoob\u201d (\u201cNight Courier\u201d) and changing social norms in \u201cNaga.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that\u2019s what reaches the world,\u201d Elshehri says of the changing shift. \u201cWhen you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.\u201d",
      "But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society.",
      "As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold.",
      "\u201cWe certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. \u201cThe Goat Life,\u201d a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question.",
      "Even \u201cMy Driver and I,\u201d featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship.",
      "Now in 2024, the film is a success story \u2014 a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it.",
      "\u201cI see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,\u201d Dakheelallah said. \u201cWe need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

      "All parent Cassie Thomas was told beforehand was that she might want to brush her hair and teeth because there was going to be a special visitor.

    "story": [
      "Paula Abdul and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Paula Abdul and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show.",
      "Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.",
      "\u201cI am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,\" Abdul said in a statement Friday. \"This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "In his own statement, Lythgoe said, \u201cWe live in a troubling time where a person is now automatically assumed to be guilty until proven innocent, a process that can take years. That is why, like Paula, I am glad to be able to put this behind me. I know the truth and that gives me great comfort.\u201d",
      "The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul\u2019s attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "Lythgoe said at the time that he was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the allegations, which he called \u201can appalling smear.\u201d",
      "After other lawsuits were filed alleging sexual misconduct, Lythgoe stepped down in January from his role as a judge on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d",
      "The 75-year-old English-born producer has been a prominent TV producer for decades in both the U.K. and the U.S., working on reality competition shows including \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \u201cone of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\u201d",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \u201cbegan shoving his tongue down her throat.\u201d Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",
      "\u201cIn tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cbut ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.\u201d",
      "Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.",
      "In 2015, Abdul became a judge on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance,\u201d appearing alongside Lythgoe.",
      "Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.",
      "Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.",
      "In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said \u201cWhile Paula\u2019s history of erratic behavior is well known, I can\u2019t pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Ice Cube could have chased trends to keep up with today\u2019s rap game for his latest release, but instead, he stayed loyal to the gritty West Coast gangsta sound that\u2019s been his signature since his early N.W.A. days and flourishing solo career.",
      "Ice Cube stuck to his streetwise storytelling roots while inserting some West Coast rap party vibes on his 11th studio album \u201cMan Down,\u201d which was released on the same day as Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise project late last month. Ice Cube's new album cracked the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s top rap albums chart \u2014 his first time in 14 years \u2014 debuting at No. 8.",
      "The rap icon made \u201cMan Down\u201d to satisfy his loyal listeners. He's known for churning out classic hip-hop jams such as \u201cIt Was a Good Day,\u201d \u201cCheck Yo Self,\u201d \u201cNo Vaseline\u201d and \u201cSteady Mobbin.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to serve your clientele,\u201d Ice Cube said about \u201cMan Down,\u201d which features Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, E-40, Killer Mike, Xzibit, and Cypress Hill\u2019s B-Real. His latest project is his first since 2018\u2019s \u201cEverythang\u2019s Corrupt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people that got you here are the people you\u2019re making the music for so to speak,\u201d said Ice Cube, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A. in 2016. \u201cNot always for the new fan or the new kid that\u2019s just getting into music. That\u2019s not who you should be reaching for if you\u2019ve been in the game for almost four decades.\u201d",
      "In a recent interview, Ice Cube spoke with The Associated Press about his partnership with the NFL, the BIG3 basketball league and his thoughts after the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Ice Cube first introduced the Contract with Black America to political leaders from both parties in 2020, and four years later, he\u2019s still driving the conversation with the NFL.",
      "He said CWBA's partnership with the league has gained traction since joining forces in 2022, creating opportunities for Black-owned businesses. The partnership between Cube's initiative and the NFL focuses on identifying opportunities in finance, tech and production.",
      "\u201cWhen they have an opening, they\u2019ll give our people that we\u2019ve put in front of them a shot at getting a job,\u201d said Ice Cube, whose CWBA aims to address the wealth gap between Black and white Americans and economic inclusion.",
      "The CWBA seeks to remove barriers and open doors.",
      "\u201cAll we want is a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAll companies have to step up and earn that job. We just say \u2018Hey, let us know when you got an opening in tech. ... and let us put a few companies in front of you. And let the best company win. They\u2019ve picked a few of our companies and now they've gotten contracts with the NFL, which is great.\u201d",
      "Ice Cube hopes the CWBA will extend beyond the NFL, encouraging other companies to adopt the initiative as well. In 2020, he presented his proposal to both main political parties, including Donald Trump's campaign, a move that sparked criticism from those who thought he was supporting Trump at the time.",
      "But that wasn't the case, Ice Cube said. Whichever party supports CWBA, he'll listen.",
      "\u201cPolitically, they would have to show me an appetite for working with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not a politician. I never went to these political parties and asked them for anything. I'm still down to help.\u201d",
      "While Ice Cube has made a mark in music, he's done the same in film too.",
      "But with Hollywood grappling with challenges like the aftermath of two major strikes and the lingering effects of the pandemic, Ice Cube has chosen the independent route for his upcoming projects. For now, he's not being reliant on major studios.",
      "\u201cIt'd be better to make independent movies and not go through the studio system,\u201d said Ice Cube, who starred in the late John Singleton 's \u201cBoyz in the Hood,\u201d \u201cAre We There Yet?\u201c and the \u201d Barbershop,\u201d \u201c Ride Along \u201d and \u201cFriday\u201d franchise films. He also wrote, starred in, produced and directed the 1998 film \u201cThe Players Club.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith independent movies, I can do some great work that\u2019s not sterilized by the studio,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they make a big movie, they spend a lot of money. When they make a low budget movie, they want to cut it at every little nook and cranny to where sometimes they cut out the best parts. You have to combat that.\u201d",
      "Ice Cube created a haven for athletes who seemed to have left their pro basketball days behind. Through his co-founded league, BIG3, he offered them a second shot \u2014 a sanctuary to keep their passion for the game alive.",
      "His 3-on-3 basketball league is gearing up for its sixth straight year, with an expanded 11-week season kicking off in summer 2025. Since its launch in 2017, the league has evolved, transitioning to a traditional city-based model where teams host home games, moving away from its original road-game-only structure.",
      "Earlier this year, BIG3 sold its first franchise in Los Angeles to a group of investors for $10 million. The games stream on CBS through Paramount+, and some stream on X.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s growing every day. We do have some great new owners and figuring out with them the direction of the league, where should we be and planting our flag,\u201d Ice Cube said about BIG3, which has starred former NBA players like Joe Johnson, Rashard Lewis, Stephen Jackson and Corey Maggette. Last year, Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown became the first active NBA player to participate in a BIG3 game.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re getting into the nuts and bolts of a big-time sports at the highest level,\u201d Ice Cube said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be there and it\u2019s a challenge every day. It\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be. To affect sports on that level, it\u2019s pretty cool from somebody who had to sneak in the Forum to see my first Laker game.\u201d",
      "If the post-presidential election blues still have you in a funk heading into the inauguration on Jan. 20, Ice Cube has a bit of advice: Stop stressing.",
      "Worrying won't change the outcome, he said.",
      "\u201cStop thinking about the future so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future is unknown. The future is anxiety, the past is depression. ... You got to believe in the future. Whatever made you strong enough to get to this point, you'll be strong enough to get you through whatever the future may bring. The key is to stop worrying about what\u2019s going to happen and pay attention to what is happening. Work accordingly.\""

      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been a rough year in the world of video games, which reeled from some high-profile flops (sorry, Suicide Squad and Star Wars fans) and a relentless series of developer layoffs. Fortunately, indie designers stepped up to fill in the gaps. And toward the end of the year, a few AAA studios rallied with ambitious, big-budget adventures.",
      "The top 10 games of 2024 recall a brighter age when it seemed like anything was possible in our virtual worlds. Here\u2019s hoping the industry learns from their success.",
      "In a politically exhausting year, Japan\u2019s Studio Zero pulled off the seemingly impossible: rendering the process of reforming a corrupt world with something resembling \u2026 hope? The corruption that has beset the quasi-medieval Euchronia is quite literal, embodied by hideous mutants known (rather unsubtly) as \u201chumans.\u201d The fight to restore sanity blends stirring battles with unusually thoughtful reflections on justice, all with the eye-popping visuals you\u2019d expect from the creators of the Persona series.",
      "The last few years have brought a surge in so-called \u201cmetroidvanias\u201d \u2014 enormous two-dimensional mazes that blend arcade action with tricky puzzles. Solo designer Billy Basso\u2019s Animal Well is the apex, presenting a vast underground network whose inhabitants range from mice to flamingos. Every challenge you solve opens a smorgasbord of new challenges, and it\u2019s easy to get lost for hours in its eerie, hallucinatory world.",
      "In this drama from Sweden\u2019s Simigo, a young woman is invited to explore a hotel that\u2019s been seemingly abandoned by its owner, an avant-garde filmmaker. Every room has a puzzle, and the more you solve the deeper you fall under its spell. It\u2019s like being trapped in a David Lynch movie, where you\u2019re always questioning the boundaries between dreams and reality.",
      "BioWare, the studio behind landmark role-playing games like Mass Effect and the original Baldur\u2019s Gate, finally returns to its strengths with this fantasy epic. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, with a motley crew of fighters, mages and rogues joining forces against a world-threatening evil. The combat is engaging, the stories are unpredictable and the characters are endearingly loopy.",
      "The most endearing character of the year has to be the adorable protagonist of this adventure from Sony\u2019s Team Asobi. The spunky little robot is on a planet-hopping mission to rescue dozens of his fellow droids, with each stop presenting a fresh assortment of running, jumping and punching challenges. It\u2019s the sort of game we used to see more of on the PlayStation, and it\u2019s thoroughly delightful.",
      "Luisa is a burnt-out corporate drone who needs a break. So why not head to the Alps and cut loose by fighting some monsters? Compared to Metaphor and Dragon Age, the dungeons devised by Austria\u2019s Microbird Games are more tightly focused, given that you can only take a few magic spells on each expedition. But the puzzles are clever, and this oddball tourist town has other intriguing mysteries worth investigating.",
      "More dungeons, as Nintendo returns to Hyrule. At long last you get to play as Princess Zelda, who wields a scepter that allows her to duplicate the tools she needs to surmount obstacles \u2014 or summon creatures to fight her foes. Echoes combines the top-down action of 1987\u2019s original-recipe Zelda with the improvisation of last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d and should satisfy fans of both.",
      "Bethesda Softworks delivers a rarity, a AAA action-adventure in which the protagonist spends more time quietly figuring out the enigmas of the Egyptian pyramids and Vatican City than mindlessly shooting enemies. Veteran voice actor Troy Baker does a fine job standing in for Harrison Ford, the dialog sparkles and the graphics are stunningly detailed. It\u2019s one of 2024\u2019s biggest surprises \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, you do get to punch Nazis.",
      "This indie smash from solo developer LocalThunk looks simple: a solitaire version of poker in which you score points by racking up good hands. Throw in some jokers, though \u2014 say, a \u201cGreedy Joker\u201d that makes diamonds more valuable \u2014 and it gets complicated. The higher your score, the more jokers become available. It\u2019s a classic \u201cjust one more hand\u201d hook; don\u2019t download Balatro if you expect to get anything else done today.",
      "A team of indie developers led by Spelunky designer Derek Yu conjured up this tribute to the games of the 1980s. It\u2019s insanely ambitious, with 50 complete games ranging across every imaginable genre, from shoot-'em-ups to strategy to racing to role-playing. There\u2019s even a Pong variant. It\u2019s a feast for anyone who remembers the dawn of video games \u2014 or is too young to have been there."

      "At the end of every year, great art inevitably gets overlooked",
      "NEW YORK -- At the end of every year, when critics rush to compile their best of the year lists, great art inevitably gets overlooked. A top 10 list doesn't leave a lot of room for discovery and, in music, that sometimes means the most innovative records lose out to make room for other titles. In this list, The Associated Press attempts to rectify that.",
      "Here are 10 of the top under-the-radar albums of the year, in no particular order, as chosen by AP Music Writer Maria Sherman.",
      "In a just world, Portuguese-born Danish singer Erika de Casier would be one of the biggest names in pop, for her retro-futuristic R&B deeply informed by the Y2K greats of the not-so-distant past. It\u2019s hard not to hear Aaliyah or Jennifer Lopez or Janet Jackson in her breathy vocal storytelling, but her songs are not simply nostalgic. They shapeshift in the inclusion of '90s U.K. garage production (\u201cEx-Girlfriend\u201d with Charli XCX collaborator Shygirl) or her creative collaborations, like on \u201cice\u201d with Florida rap duo They Hate Change.",
      "One-fourth of the rap collective Drain Gang \u2014 that\u2019s Bladee (pronounced \u201cBlade\u201d) \u2014 and emo rap prodigy Yung Lean teamed up for the surprise release \u201cPsykos\u201d earlier this year, a genre-allergic, rock-infused hip-hop collection of depressive pop. It's a fatalistic record for a lost, moony generation, and it may take a few listens for these Swedes to connect. But once their music does, it sounds like a surrealist document on the current moment.",
      "Sudanese Canadian singer Mustafa\u2019s \u201cDunya\u201d (which translates from Arabic to \u201cthe world\u201d) hits like ancient folkloric tradition and sounds like poetry. (It\u2019s Mustafa The Poet, after all, though he\u2019s also scored writing credits for the likes of The Weeknd,Shawn Mendes,Camila Cabello and the Jonas Brothers.) He\u2019s said the album works to \u201cpreserve and celebrate the ordinary life in the hood,\u201d what is delicately and purposefully articulated across vignettes of love, loss and his native Toronto. \u201cLeaving Toronto,\u201d specifically, is a tearjerker \u2014 a touching tribute to his city and his late brother, who was shot and killed last year.",
      "Pakistani American astral folk-jazz artist Arooj Aftab is celebrated in certain circles and lacks visibility in others: She\u2019s a Grammy winner who has been nominated the past three years in a row and is up for two more in 2025. She\u2019s performed at the White House. Earlier this month, she delivered an evocative set on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d a welcomed disruption from the kinds of artists who normally grace American late-night television. But she's far from a household name, more likely to be your favorite artist's favorite artist. Whatever the case, her fourth album is a testament to her greatness. \u201cNight Reign\u201d combines cultures and genres for a gorgeous matrimony.",
      "Those who declare there are no rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands anymore aren\u2019t listening closely enough. Enter Austin weirdos Being Dead, whose sophomore album \u201cEels\u201d is an asymmetrical collection of egg punk, Devo-worship, a recording of a bus driver who has had enough, psychedelic harmonies and various other oddball sensibilities that make them the best college radio rock band in recent history. And if that isn\u2019t enough to convince a nonbeliever, the proof is in the pudding \u2014 or in this case, the producer: Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Tegan and Sara) took the reins on the 16-track collection. And his co-sign means something.",
      "Detroit rapper Boldy James often works by finding a single \u2014 and singular \u2014 producer with whom he works closely for an album of distinction. This year, he\u2019s found a partner in Kansas City producer Conductor Williams for \u201cAcross the Tracks,\u201d a dreamy, loop-heavy record of rap excellence. It\u2019s right there from the jump. Intro \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d is stuffed with vintage, soulful sensibilities and undeniable bars. \u201cWas taught to always be the message I bring / Pulled the sword from the stone,\u201d he delivers in his cool monotone. \u201cCould never compete / They know the flow is rather unique (blocks) / I kept the receipts.\u201d",
      "In a time where celebrity musicians strive to appear like they avoid categorization, Guatemala-born, Mexico City-based cellist Mabe Fratti lives it. Her album, \u201cSentir Que No Sabes\u201d (\u201cFeel Like You Don\u2019t Know\u201d), thrives in the uncertainty of its title. Her inventive compositions contort her chosen instrument, as well as horns and drums and pianos, into something resembling free-form jazz. Or is it post-punk pop? Experimental electro-folk? These are never quite dissonant compositions, but they are unusual, askew. Language loses out here, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing.",
      "It is a failure of imagination that \u201cbest of\u201d music lists often fail to account for metal and its subgenres, despite consistently being one of the most popular musical forms the world over. But sometimes a metal album is too grand to ignore. That is the case with American death metal band Blood Incantation, whose fourth studio album \u201cAbsolute Elsewhere\u201d stunned even the genre's most transitory listeners for its prog rock spirit, synth detouring, playful kraut teases, hardened blast beats and throat-ripping vocals. It\u2019s cinematic.",
      "There's something in the water in Denmark. In 2024, some of the most exciting singer-songwriters hailed from the Scandinavian country: ML Buch and Clarissa Connelly, as well as de Casier. But it\u2019s the folk and classical songs of Astrid Sonne\u2019s \u201cGreat Doubt\u201d that truly struck a chord with us. It answers the question: What would a classically trained composer making experimental, haunted pop music with detuned pianos and woodwinds and flutes and brass actually sound like? Great, it turns out.",
      "The emergence of Cindy Lee has been described as the result of \u201canti-hype,\u201d an Internet neologism that doesn't mean much more than \u201climited publicity inspired intrigue.\u201d Lee \u2014 the drag alter ego of Women\u2019s Patrick Flegel, a fixture of Canadian indie rock since the early 2010s \u2014 originally released this lo-fi gem as an unmarked YouTube link. \u201cDiamond Jubilee\u201d resonated with avid, curious listeners \u2014 the kind undeterred by the fact that listening to this album, at one point in time, meant sitting down with all two hours and 32 minutes of it. But it\u2019s Lee\u2019s ambitious and expansive psych and garage rock that kept them coming back."

      "How many roads must a man walk down to play Bob Dylan",
      "NEW YORK -- How many roads must a man walk down to play Bob Dylan?",
      "Quite a few, at least, if you're Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Off and on for some six years, Chalamet has been obsessively working toward his performance in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d He has visited Dylan's childhood home, learned how to play the guitar (and the harmonica) and immersed himself in the early \u201860s New York that Dylan emerged out of \u2014 even if much of it has faded with history by now.",
      "\u201cCafe Wha? was funny because they have Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan painted along the staircase and everything but now it\u2019s just, like, Aerosmith covers,\u201d Chalamet says, chuckling. \u201cI was like: I don\u2019t think this is what it was like when Bob was here.\u201d",
      "Chalamet has been building his Bob Dylan for so long that he's been seen playing Dylan songs while in costume as Willy Wonka and on the set of \u201cDune.\u201d His \u201cDune\u201d co-star, Oscar Isaac (who famously played a fictional Dylan-adjacent folk musician in \u201cInside Llewyn Davis\"), said, \u201dMy first thought, it sounded like a really bad idea.\"",
      "Isaac certainly wasn't the only one to doubt whether Chalamet, or anyone, could tackle someone as iconic and enigmatic as Dylan. But Chalamet's performance \u2014 complete with singing and guitar playing \u2014 in the James Mangold-directed film, which opens in theaters Dec. 25, has drawn near-universal praise. Chalamet has been nominated for a Golden Globe; if he were to be nominated and win at the Academy Awards, the 28-year-old would be the youngest best actor winner ever.",
      "Even Dylan, who gave Mangold notes on the film, has said: \u201cTimmy\u2019s a brilliant actor so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me.\u201d",
      "The Dylan in question in \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" loosely based on Elijah Wald\u2019s 2015 book, \u201cDylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night That Split the Sixties,\u201d is a young, just-starting-out Dylan. By the end of the film, which culminates in the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, he's gone from folk messiah to Judas.",
      "Chalamet recently spoke to The Associated Press about how he navigated the biggest acting challenge of his career.",
      "CHALAMET: I like how you framed the question initially, that it\u2019s an undertaking. Bob Dylan is not only someone whose behaviorism and whose presence as a cultural figure is iconic, but, more importantly, as a thinker, as an artist, as a shaper of American culture through the last 60, 70 years, he's The Guy in a lot of ways. I obviously felt like you can\u2019t go near that if you\u2019re not ready to do it. Equally, I had five years to work on this, or six, so there was no truncated process at any point. If you play any real-life figure, it\u2019s sort of a gift. There\u2019s the reality of how it happened. But with a musician, your education becomes twofold, or tenfold, because there\u2019s not only the record of what he went through in his work, but the feeling he can give you as a person \u2014 which for me, with Bob\u2019s music, was exponential. It was indescribable \u2014 like many people, maybe yourself. And I wouldn\u2019t even try to describe it because he wouldn\u2019t.",
      "CHALAMET: Weirdly, it was the press conferences. This came to me in an email in 2018. Bob Dylan, to me, was limited to the good friend of my father\u2019s in New York, growing up, who had a striking black-and-white portrait of Dylan on his apartment wall. I didn\u2019t know much of his music. You know, stuff like \u201cBlowing in the Wind\u201d or \u201cTime\u2019s They Are a-Changin'\u201d are so enwoven in American culture that, of course, I knew those.",
      "I just went up YouTube and before songs popped up, the San Francisco press conference popped up in \u201965. I was just so fascinated to see an artist who was a definitive figure of the \u201960s, but who clearly was as much a thinker as he was a forward-facing entertainer. It\u2019s really, really rare to find the people that are deep thinkers and lyricists and artists that as much forward-facing entertainers. So when these artists pop up, like Bob Dylan, or I think in today\u2019s culture, Frank Ocean, we all have a responsibility to champion these artists. Usually, the sensitive nature or whatever you want to call it, would encourage someone with a deep brain like that to not put themselves out there like that \u2014 that\u2019s my theory.",
      "CHALAMET: It was really D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back.\u201d That was a Bible to me on this. I love, love, love that film. I love music documentaries. There\u2019s a Lil\u2019 Wayne documentary called \u201cThe Carter\u201d that\u2019s all these moments. It\u2019s just so special when you can get your camera on these music artists when they\u2019re at a moment like Bob was in \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back.\u201d Lil\u2019 Wayne in \u201cThe Carter\u201d is the same thing where they\u2019re learning to turn their back in some way, but they haven\u2019t done it yet.",
      "CHALAMET: The great thing about \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back\u201d is it\u2019s just really raw. There aren\u2019t the talking heads. It\u2019s what\u2019s great about Suze Rotolo's book. It\u2019s really raw. It\u2019s more raw than a lot of the other books about Bob Dylan. It\u2019s very clear-sighted about the young relationship she had with Bob. With an artist of such reverence, it\u2019s important as an actor not to simply revere him. Then you\u2019ll do justice to the people that already revere him, but to everyone else in the room, they won\u2019t get it.",
      "CHALAMET: I picked up a guitar on \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d because I pluck out the chords of a song in that film. So I had, like, a really rudimental experience with that. I think sometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID. I think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.",
      "CHALAMET: All of it. I really liked all of it. I like the more intimate songs like \u201cGirl From the North Country\u201d or \u201cBoots of Spanish Leather\u201d or \u201cOne Too Many Mornings\u201d or \u201cTomorrow Is a Long Time.\u201d But then I also liked \u201cNorth Country Blues\u201d and \u201cRocks and Gravel\u201d or \u201cBallad of Hollis Brown\u201d \u2014 things where you hear the iron ore in Bob\u2019s voice, the North Country in Minnesota, the Hibbing. The Hibbing that when I visited you really felt like you were on the edge of America, like the edge of the world. These factories that are covered in snow and the icy roads. That stuff, as a New Yorker, I just started to fall in love with.",
      "CHALAMET: Yeah, absolutely, in ways that are more unspoken than I could be definitive about. I just do. I don\u2019t know how to use more words than that. And it was empowering to play someone that really just bucked off all pressure.",
      "CHALAMET: That is a young man saying: Why are the older people in this room the signifiers and those who determine who the young lights forward are? Maybe the way he said it \u2014 talking about hair loss for older people being representative of their old age (laughs) \u2014 wasn\u2019t the nicest way of putting it. But what he was saying, it has an element of truth. And at a time when media was more centralized or something, I think his attitude toward it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to speak for him.",
      "CHALAMET: I think I\u2019d just say thank you, really. Not thank you for the opportunity to meet, or thank you for the opportunity to play the role. Thank you for his music and his art and his work.",
      "CHALAMET: I spent time in Duluth and Hibbing and Wisconsin and Chicago. I tried to retrace those steps leading to New York where he arrived in the early \u201960s. That wasn\u2019t some academy process. That wasn\u2019t trying to excavate the exact footprint and see if there was some DNA remaining and what that meant about where he was psychologically at the time. That was simply to be in the energy of these places and quell some insecurity I had about growing up in midtown Manhattan in the 2000s and how that would be different from growing up in iron ore country in the \u201950s and \u201960s.",
      "Granted, that\u2019s a different place than it was 60, 70 years ago \u2014 which was also moving to me, honestly. The unspoken metaphor I was feeling was: The world goes on. The times they are a\u2019changing and things have changed. Being a brilliant poet or artist like Bob is isn\u2019t the remedy for everyone.",
      "I also have this personal affinity for these artists that come from the Midwest of the United State. Kid Cudi is obviously a hip-hop artist I\u2019m hugely admiring of who came from Cleveland. It\u2019s beyond me. Because I had a hard enough time getting my career going being from New York. When I got to Hibbing, you think of this hero\u2019s journey of this young man.",
      "CHALAMET: I feel changed by the experience. I can\u2019t speak about the actual film. The process of it, the yearslong endeavor into it, the dignity in playing something that actually happened. Those were new facets to my experience as an artist. Beyond that, people will make of it what they will, which is totally fair. I think that\u2019s a great Bob worldview, too. Do with it what you want."

      "A British immigration tribunal upheld the decision on Thursday in a ruling that revealed the Chinese national had developed such a close relationship with Andrew that he was invited to the prince\u2019s birthday party.",
      "Government officials were concerned the man could have misused his influence because the prince was under \u201cconsiderable pressure\u201d at the time, according to the ruling.",
      "British authorities believe the Chinese national, whose name wasn\u2019t released, was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.",
      "The government determined that the businessman \u201cwas in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent U.K. figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,\u201d according to the tribunal's decision.",
      "In a statement from his office, Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, said he accepted government advice and ceased all contact with the Chinese national as soon as concerns were raised.",
      "\u201cThe Duke met the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed,\u2033 his office said. \u201cHe is unable to comment further on matters relating to national security.\u201d",
      "Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners, raising concerns that those individuals are trying to buy access to the royal family.",
      "Andrew\u2019s finances have been squeezed in recent years after he was forced to step away from royal duties and give up public funding amid concerns about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted pedophile who committed suicide in prison in 2019.",

In 2022, Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, warned politicians that a British-Chinese lawyer had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China.",
      "The 50-year-old Chinese national covered by this week\u2019s ruling was described as a man who worked as a junior civil servant in China before he came to the U.K. as a student in 2002. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting a business that advises U.K.-based companies on their operations in China.",
      "He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Although he didn\u2019t make Britain his permanent home, the man told authorities that he spent one to two weeks a month in the country and considered it his \u201csecond home.\u201d",
      "He was stopped while entering the U.K. on Nov. 6, 2021, and ordered to surrender his mobile phone and other digital devices on which authorities found a letter from a senior adviser to Andrew confirming that he was authorized to act on behalf of the prince in relation to potential partners and investors in China.",
      "The letter and other documents highlighted the strength of the relationship between Andrew, his adviser and the Chinese national.",
      "\u201cI also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,\u201d the adviser wrote. \u201cYou should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.\u201d",
      "The letter went on to describe how they had found a way to work around former private secretaries to the prince and other people who weren\u2019t completely trusted.",
      "\u201cUnder your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor,\u201d the adviser wrote.",

      "But both slowly returned to duty after receiving treatment. The public studied the pictures to judge for themselves how the royals were responding.",
      "Charles, 76, came back first, marking his return with a visit to a cancer center, where he shared his experiences with patients undergoing chemotherapy. Sometimes seen as stuffy and out of touch, Charles left the clinic as a king who could understand and empathize with those facing illness and the uncertain path to recovery.",
      "As the monarch walked out the doors, his face broke into a broad grin and he held a bouquet of pink spring flowers aloft in triumph, celebrating with the crowd that had turned out to wish him well.",
      "Underscoring his improvement, Charles took a stamina-sapping trip in October, traveling across 12 time zones to visit Australia and Samoa.",
      "Kate\u2019s return took longer.",
      "The public got their first post-diagnosis glimpse of the 42-year-old princess through a carriage window as she attended the king\u2019s birthday parade, known as Trooping the Color, in June. Kate also appeared at the national Remembrance Day ceremony honoring fallen servicemen and women in November as well as her annual Christmas carol service in December as she slowly took on more duties.",
      "But there\u2019s one picture that captures the princess\u2019 year.",
      "It\u2019s from the day in July when Kate attended the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final, stepping in front of the public for the first time without a hat brim or a window between her and the cameras.",
      "The crowd is blurred, and she\u2019s looking over her shoulder. Her smile is huge."

    "title": "\u2018The Bibi Files,\u2019 with leaked Netanyahu footage, can't be seen in Israel. Israelis are finding ways",
    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 11:30:23 -0500",
    "summary": "&ldquo;The Bibi Files&rdquo; started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
    "story": [
      "\u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
      "NEW YORK -- Veteran documentarian Alex Gibney, who in a decades-long career has tackled many a thorny issue, wasn't planning a film about Israel \u2014 until one day last year, when a stunning leak fell into his hands.",
      "The leak turned out to be more like a deluge.",
      "Suddenly, Gibney, through a source who contacted him on the Signal messaging app, was being offered access to copious video recordings of police interviews with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his wife Sara, his son Yair, and a host of associates and benefactors, all conducted as part of the sprawling corruption case against Netanyahu. It amounted to an astonishing 1,000-plus hours of tapes.",
      "The Oscar-winning filmmaker didn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but sensed this was something big. He turned to longtime Israeli investigative reporter Raviv Drucker, who did a deep dive into the material, Gibney says, and showed him that \u201cwe had something that was very explosive.\u201d Then Gibney enlisted colleague Alexis Bloom, who had worked in Israel, to direct.",
      "The result: \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d a hard-hitting documentary that certainly has timing on its side \u2014 this week, as it was released on streaming, Netanyahu took the stand in the long-running case.",
      "If the timing is fortuitous, the film faced other obstacles. For one thing, Gibney and Bloom had to raise funds without disclosing to potential backers what they had, given the secrecy involved. Many potential backers and distributors were also nervous about getting involved, especially once war broke out after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Then there was the biggest obstacle of all: The film cannot legally be shown in Israel, due to privacy laws regulating such proceedings.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Israelis aren\u2019t seeing it, though. Many have managed to watch the film either by using a VPN to bypass streaming restrictions, or by watching leaked versions that made their way to social media. \u201cThe film is being pirated like wildfire in Israel,\u201d says Bloom.",
      "And it has made a predictable splash, just as Netanyahu becomes the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. On Tuesday, he promised defiantly to knock down the \u201cabsurd\u201d corruption allegations against him.",
      "The longest-serving prime minister in Israel\u2019s history is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests, and of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage.",
      "In the leaked police videos, the 75-year-old leader sits at his desk in a surprisingly cramped office, a map of the region behind him. He expresses outrage at the proceedings, calls witnesses liars, and notes he has much weightier matters to attend to. At one point, asked about numbers of champagne bottles, he says he spends his time counting missiles threatening Israel, not bottles. Frequently, his answer is he doesn't remember.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of people on the record telling us what a great memory he has,\u201d says Gibney. \u201cAnd almost every question that could be possibly incriminating, he says \u2018I can\u2019t recall.\u2019\"",
      "Reviews in Israeli media for \u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d have mostly been positive, while noting that Netanyahu is portrayed in a harsh light. Not surprisingly, public reaction reflects longstanding divisions over the polarizing leader. He and his supporters say he\u2019s the subject of a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and biased justice system out to topple his rule.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s opponents will swear by the film and will only become more convinced that he is corrupt, dizzy with power and leading us to destruction,\u201d Nir Wolf, TV critic for the Netanyahu-friendly Israel Hayom paper, wrote. \u201cHis supporters will want to embrace him more.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has also noticed the film. In September, his lawyer asked the country\u2019s attorney general to investigate Drucker, who is a co-producer with Gibney, accusing him of trying to influence the legal proceedings. No investigation has been launched. (In the film, Drucker notes that Netanyahu has previously sued him three times.)",
      "The film, which intersperses police footage with commentary from former officials, Netanyahu associates, journalists and other analysts \u2014 including, frequently, Drucker \u2014 begins with the prime minister sitting for his first interview.",
      "\u201cWith Netanyahu, nothing concentrates his mind more than the sound of the prison gate slammed behind his back,\u201d comments Nimrod Novik, a former adviser to late Prime Minister Shimon Peres. One of Gibney and Bloom's key arguments will be that Netanyahu\u2019s fear of potential prison time has influenced his policy decisions \u2014 from judicial reform to war.",
      "Netanyahu appears indignant throughout. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me delusional questions,\u201d he tells his questioners. \u201cThis is preposterous and insane.\u201d",
      "In other footage, Arnon Milchan, the billionaire Hollywood mogul, Netanyahu friend and, more recently, prosecution witness, describes delivering fancy pink champagne on demand for Sara Netanyahu, sometimes toting a cooler himself, as part of an alleged gifts-for-favors scheme. Elsewhere, Sara Netanyahu sits for questioning herself. \u201cHow are you not ashamed of yourselves?\u201d she sharply admonishes the interviewers. She tells them that outside Israel, her husband is justly received as a king.",
      "Footage also includes interviews with Israeli-American billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. Sheldon Adelson expresses discomfort with the friendship \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll continue the relationship with them\" \u2014 and dismay over the cost of Netanyahu's preferred Cuban cigars: $1,100 for a box of 10.",
      "And a combative Yair Netanyahu, the couple\u2019s 33-year old son, tells his questioners: \u201cYou\u2019re investigating me because the Israeli police has become the Stasi secret police, wanting to overthrow the government.\u201d",
      "Director Bloom insists the film is not intended to preach to the choir \u2014 that it is made not for leftist opponents of Netanyahu, but for centrists.",
      "\u201cYou know, a hardcore Bibi-ist is probably going to remain a hardcore Bibi-est,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut there are a lot of centrists. \u2026 And it\u2019s very much a portrait of one family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anti-Israel, in the slightest.\u201d",
      "The filmmakers say they paused after the Oct. 7 attack, trying to figure out how to approach it. As part of the historical context in the film, they include chilling scenes of the raid on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhat was this going to mean?\u201d Gibney says they wondered. \u201cWith a bit of time, it became clear that this tale that we started before Oct. 7 remained a story of corruption \u2014 the size of the corruption kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\u201d",
      "The film, which began streaming Wednesday on the new service Jolt.film, draws a direct connection between Netanyahu's legal problems and the war. Through various commentators, it argues that the criminal cases led the prime minister to launch a campaign to weaken the country\u2019s judiciary, which in turn sparked mass protests and divisions that created an image of national weakness and led Hamas to attack. (Netanyahu rejects all such accusations).",
      "Bloom says she hopes people will, having watched \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d consider the idea that \u201cterm limits are a good idea.\" (Netanyahu has served a total of 17 years as prime minister.)",
      "And she also hopes they will take away a simple concept. \u201cIt's OK to criticize the prime minister of Israel, and it\u2019s not antisemitic and it\u2019s not anti-Israel,\u201d the director says. \"He\u2019s a political leader, like any other. \u201c",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a Friday statement. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s nominee for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisors filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022.

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also responded Friday to the Times report.

    "story": [
      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

    "story": [
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.",
      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work for opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according to court papers filed in Virginia",
      "BOSTON -- McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin, according to court papers filed in Virginia on Friday.",
      "As part of the deal with the U.S. Justice Department, McKinsey will avoid prosecution on criminal charges if it pays the sum and follows certain conditions for five years, including ceasing any work on the sale, marketing or promotion of controlled substances.",
      "A former McKinsey senior partner, Martin Elling, has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for deleting documents from his laptop after he became aware of investigations into Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin that was then a client, according to the filings. A lawyer for Elling declined to comment Friday.",
      "McKinsey said in a statement on Friday that it's \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for its work for Purdue Pharma.",
      "\u201cWe should have appreciated the harm opioids were causing in our society and we should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret for our firm.\u201d",
      "It's the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold accountable companies officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of them have been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis.",
      "Purdue paid McKinsey more than $93 million over 15 years for several products, including how to improve revenue from OxyContin. Prosecutors say McKinsey \u201cknew the risk and dangers\u201d of OxyContin and knew that Purdue Pharma executives had previously pleaded guilty to crimes related to the promotion of the drug, but decided to work with the opioid manufacturer anyway.",
      "One of the jobs for McKinsey, the papers said, was to identify which prescribers would generate the most additional prescriptions if Purdue salespeople focused on that. That resulted in prescriptions that \u201cwere not for a medically accepted indication, were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d the filing said.",
      "\u201cThis was not hypothetical,\" Christopher Kavanaugh, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said in a news conference in Boston on Friday. \u201cThis was not just marketing. It was a strategy. It was executed and it worked.\u201d",
      "During work to \u201cturbocharge\u201d Purdue sales in 2013 after a drop in business, McKinsey consultants accompanied Purdue sales representatives on visits to prescribers and pharmacies to gather information. In a note about one ride-along, a McKinsey consultant said one pharmacist had a gun \u201cand was shaking; abuse is definitely a huge issue.\u201d The company continued looking for ways to increase OxyContin sales, according to court papers.",
      "In 2014, McKinsey identified some small clinics that were writing more opioid prescriptions than entire hospital systems \u2014 and suggested they be targeted for more sales, the court filing said.",
      "The company also tried to help Purdue get a say in shaping federal rules intended to ensure the benefits of addictive prescription drugs outweighed the risks. The government said in its new filings that that resulted in making high-dose OxyContin subject to the same oversight as lower-dose opioids and made training for prescribers voluntary rather than mandatory.",
      "Since 2021, McKinsey has agreed to pay state and local governments about $765 million in settlements for its role in advising businesses on how to sell more of the powerful prescription painkillers amid a national opioid crisis.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of nine tiny equines from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the horses, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of nine equines \u2014 the six American miniature horses, one that was later born in Greece, and two rescued ponies - Billy the Shetland pony and Giselle who was rescued from the island of Santorini.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",
      "Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. \u201cI\u2019m making super-human efforts,\u201d said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program\u2019s continuity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",
      "Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can.",
      "During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the reactions. It\u2019s like something awakens their senses,\u201d said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki.",
      "The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, \u201cis very important for us. Especially when it\u2019s spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn\u2019t instigated by us,\u201d Volikaki said.",
      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the (horses) get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",
      "His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.",
      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",
      "He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month backpacking trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found \u201cthe perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.\u201d",
      "In late April, he advised another Reddit user with a back problem to \u201ckeep trying different surgeons\u201d and, if necessary, convey an inability to keep working.",
      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",

      "In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Donald Trump weighs in on Jan. 6 pardons, immigration issues and world affairs",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was on the verge of backing a 16-week federal abortion ban earlier this year when aides staged an intervention.",
      "According to Time magazine's cover story on his selection as its 2024 Person of the Year, Trump's aides first raised concerns in mid-March that the abortion cutoff being pushed by some allies would be stricter than existing law in numerous states. It was seen as a potential political liability amid ongoing fallout over the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that includes three justices nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "Trump political director James Blair went to work assembling a slide deck \u2014 eventually titled \u201cHow a national abortion ban will cost Trump the election\" \u2014 that argued a 16-week ban would hurt the Republican candidate in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the magazine reported.",
      "\u201cAfter flipping through Blair\u2019s presentation\" on a flight to a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in April, Trump dropped the idea, according to the report. \"So we leave it to the states, right?\" Trump was quoted as saying. He soon released a video articulating that position.",
      "At the time, Trump\u2019s campaign denied that he was considering supporting the 16-week ban, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and saying Trump planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House.",
      "Here are other highlights from the story and the president-elect's 65-minute interview with the magazine:",
      "Trump reaffirmed his plans to pardon most of those convicted for their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would look at individuals on a \u201ccase-by-case\" basis, but that \u201ca vast majority of them should not be in jail.\u201d",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump insisted he has the authority to use the military to assist with his promised mass deportations, even though, as his interviewers noted, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military in domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help.\"",
      "Trump did not deny that camps would be needed to hold detained migrants as they are processed for deportation.",
      "\u201cWhatever it takes to get them out. I don\u2019t care,\" he said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not going to need too many because I want to get them out and I don\u2019t want them sitting in camp for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Trump told Time he does not plan to restore the policy of separating children from their families to deter border crossings, but he did not rule it out. The practice led to thousands of children being separated from their parents and was condemned around the globe as inhumane.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have to because we will send the whole family back,\u201d he said. \u201cI would much rather deport them together, yes, than separate.\u201d",
      "Trump dismissed the idea that Elon Musk will face conflicts of interest as he takes the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group that Trump has selected him to lead. The panel is supposed to find waste and cut regulations, including many that could affect Musk's wide-ranging interests, which include electric cars, rockets and telecommunications.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\" Trump said. \u201cI think that Elon puts the country long before his company. ... He considers this to be his most important project.\"",

      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid specific surgeries, according to two studies exploring ways to lessen treatment burdens.",
      "One new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines whether removing lymph nodes is always necessary in early breast cancer. Another in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a new approach to a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.",
      "The research was discussed Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.",
      "Every year, about 50,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, where the cells that line milk ducts become cancerous, but the nearby breast tissue remains healthy. Many choose to have surgery, although it\u2019s unclear whether they could instead take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with more frequent monitoring.",
      "The new study, based on two years of data, suggests that such active monitoring is a safe alternative to surgery for many of these women, though some doctors will want to see if the results hold up over time.",
      "\u201cThis is an option that patients should consider for their DCIS,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor a long time, we\u2019ve had the feeling that we\u2019re overtreating some patients with DCIS. This is a confirmation of what we suspected is happening.\u201d",
      "Taking a more cautious view, Dr. Monica Morrow of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, said a two-year study isn't long enough to draw conclusions.",
      "The finding is based on following more than 950 U.S. patients randomly assigned to surgery or active monitoring. All had low-risk DCIS with no sign of invasive cancer. They had the type of DCIS that responds to hormone-blocking drugs and many in the study took those drugs as part of their treatment.",
      "After two years, the rates of invasive cancer were low and did not differ significantly between the groups, with about 6% in the surgery group and about 4% in the monitoring group diagnosed with invasive cancer.",
      "Among patients in the monitoring group, changes spotted on a mammogram would prompt a biopsy. They also could opt for surgery at any time for any reason.",
      "Some study participants didn\u2019t stick with the treatment they were randomly assigned. So in a separate analysis looking at those who actually had surgery or not, the rates of invasive cancer were about 9% for the surgery group and 3% for the monitoring group.",
      "The researchers will continue to follow the patients to see if the finding holds up over a decade.",
      "Tina Clark, 63, of Buxton, Maine, joined the study after being diagnosed with DCIS in 2019. Randomly assigned to the monitoring-only group, she was able to avoid surgery and radiation during a time when she was raising a teenage nephew and going through the illness and death of her husband.",
      "\u201cI feel just so grateful and fortunate that I found this study when I did,\u201d Clark said.",
      "She has mammograms every six months to keep watch on the DCIS in her right breast, which has not advanced. The mammograms spotted a small cancer in her other breast in 2023, unrelated to the DCIS. She had a lumpectomy to remove it.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re diagnosed with low-risk DCIS, you have time to understand more about your disease and understand what your options are,\u201d said study author Dr. Shelley Hwang of Duke University School of Medicine.",
      "Women having surgery for breast cancer often also have what\u2019s called a sentinel lymph node biopsy where a few lymph nodes in the armpit are removed to check for spreading cancer.",
      "But removing lymph nodes can cause lasting pain and arm swelling, so research is underway to determine when it can be avoided. A study in Europe last year showed that older women with small tumors could safely avoid the added surgery.",
      "In the new study, researchers in Germany looked at whether women with early breast cancer who were planning to have breast-conserving surgery could safely skip having lymph nodes removed. They followed 4,858 women who were randomly assigned to have lymph nodes removed or not.",
      "After five years, about 92% of women in both groups were still alive and free of cancer.",
      "\u201cRemoving lymph nodes does not improve survival, and the risk of cancer coming back in the armpit is quite low when lymph nodes are not removed,\u201d said Morrow, who added that some women will still need the lymph node procedure to help determine which treatment drugs they should take after surgery.",

      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",

      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",

      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compare the years 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens hitting 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from nearly 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared with the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes says she is suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness over what she calls \u201cexcessive pumping\u201d of groundwater",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county.",
      "The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:58:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",

      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited a program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",

      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Dressed in a faded pink dress, 6-year-old Juliet Samaniya squats under scorching skies to chip at a jagged white rock with a stone tool. Dust coats her tiny hands and her hair as she works hour after hour for less than a dollar a day. The landscape around her is dotted with active and abandoned mineshafts, farmland that may soon be cleared in search of more rich ore, and other mine workers \u2014 many of them children.",
      "Juliet should be in school, her mother, Abigail Samaniya, admits. Instead, she spends her day mining lithium, a mineral critical for batteries needed in the global transition to clean energy, to earn money that helps sustain her family.",
      "\u201cThat is the only option,\u201d Abigail Samaniya said.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria\u2019s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "That company, RSIN Nigeria Limited, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Nigeria has laws requiring basic education and prohibiting child labor, but enforcement is a challenge with many illegal mines in hard-to-reach areas. Corruption among regulatory and law enforcement officials is also a problem. The government said it's pursuing reforms that would toughen laws. Earlier this year it also launched a \u201ccorps of mining marshals\u201d to combat illegal mining, but activists say it's too soon to tell if that program is helping.",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit.

They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse \u2014 all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners.",
      "\u201cBut it is God that protects,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children\u2019s homes.",
      "In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said.",
      "Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet\u2019s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty.",
      "Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. \u201cI used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.\u201d He denied the school charges fees.",
      "Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth \u2014 including lithium \u2014 is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,\" he said.",
      "Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments.",
      "The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad.",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",

      "Congo's army accused the M23 of killing 12 civilians earlier this week in villages of the Lubero territory in the eastern province of North-Kivu in a statement on Friday. An M23 spokesperson told The Associated Press it denied the accusation, discrediting it as \u201cpropaganda\u201d from Congo's government.",

      "Panahipour told The Associated Press: \u201cUnfortunately, we do not know the charges against Ms. Ahmady, who arrested her, or her place of detention, but we will follow up on the matter through legal authorities.\u201d",
      "He also said two musicians in Ahmady's band \u2014 Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar \u2014 were arrested in Tehran on Saturday.",
      "Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, women were banned at first from singing altogether, then from singing or dancing solo before mixed-gender audiences. Female vocalists could perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. But they are allowed to sing in a hall for female-only audiences.",
      "Also based on Iranian and Islamic law, women are not allowed to appear without a hijab in front of men who are not related.",
      "In Iran, the hijab \u2014 and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some \u2014 has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families.",
      "There were protests across Iran in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest by the country\u2019s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab. While police became hesitant to strictly enforce the Islamic dress code \u2014 possibly to avoid even wider demonstrations and displays of defiance \u2014 in recent weeks the authorities' tone has changed."

      "The court is expected to deliver its verdicts by Dec. 20 in the trial of 51 defendants. Last month, prosecutors asked the panel of judges for the maximum possible penalty for aggravated rape \u2014 20 years \u2014 against the victim\u2019s now ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, 72.",

    "story": [
      "Palestinian refugees, whose homes in the Yarmouk camp near Damascus were destroyed during Syria\u2019s civil war, have started to return to the neighborhood since the fall of President Bashar Assad",
      "DAMASCUS -- The Yarmouk refugee camp outside Damascus was considered the capital of the Palestinian diaspora before the war in Syria reduced it to row after row of blasted out buildings where there were once falafel stands, pharmacies and mosques.",
      "Taken over by a series of militant groups then bombarded by government planes, the camp has been all but abandoned since 2018. The buildings that were not destroyed by bombs were demolished by the government or stripped by thieves. Those who wanted to return to rebuild their homes were stymied by Kafkaesque bureaucratic and security requirements.",
      "But bit by bit, the camp\u2019s former occupants have trickled back. After the Dec. 8 fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad in a lightening offensive by opposition forces, many more hope they will be able do so.",
      "At the same time, Syria's Palestinian refugees \u2014 a population of about 450,000 \u2014 are unsure of their place in the new order.",
      "\u201cThe new Syrian leadership, how will it deal with the Palestinian issue?\u201d said Palestinian ambassador to Syria Samir al-Rifai. \u201cWe have no information because we have had no contact with each other so far.\u201d",
      "Days after Assad\u2019s government collapsed, women walked in groups through the streets of Yarmouk while children played in the rubble. Motorcycles, bicycles and the occasional car passed between bombed-out buildings. In one of the less heavily damaged areas, a fruit and vegetable market was doing brisk business.",
      "Some people were coming back for the first time in years to check on their homes. Others had been back before but only now were thinking about rebuilding and returning for good.",
      "Ahmad al-Hussein left the camp in 2011, soon after the beginning of the anti-government uprising-turned-civil-war. A few months ago, driven by rising rents elsewhere, he came back to live with relatives in a part of the camp that was relatively untouched.",
      "He is now hoping to rebuild his home in a building that was reduced to a hollowed-out shell and marked for demolition.",
      "Under Assad\u2019s rule, getting permission from security agencies to enter the camp \u201cwasn\u2019t easy,\u201d al-Hussein said. \u201cYou would have to sit at a table and answer who\u2019s your mother, who\u2019s your father, and who in your family was arrested and who was with the rebels. \u2026 Twenty-thousand questions to get the approval,\u201d",
      "He said people who had been reluctant now want to return, among them his son, who fled to Germany.",
      "Taghrid Halawi came with two other women on Thursday to check on their houses. They spoke wistfully of the days when the streets of the camp used to buzz with life until 3 or 4 a.m.",
      "\u201cYou really feel that your Palestine is here, even though you are far from Palestine,\u201d Halawi said. \u201cEven with all this destruction, I feel like it\u2019s like heaven. I hope that everyone returns, all the ones who left the country or are living in other areas.\u201d",
      "Yarmouk was built in 1957 as a Palestinian refugee camp but grew into a vibrant suburb where many working-class Syrians settled. Before the war, some 1.2 million people lived in Yarmouk, including 160,000 Palestinians, according to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Today, it houses some 8,160 Palestinian refugees who remained or have returned.",
      "Palestinian refugees in Syria are not given citizenship, ostensibly to preserve their right to go back to the homes they fled or were forced from during the 1948 creation of the state of Israel and where they are currently banned from returning.",
      "But in contrast to neighboring Lebanon, where Palestinians are banned from owning property or working in many professions, in Syria, Palestinians historically had all the rights of citizens except the right to vote and run for office \u2014 a negligible matter given that the outcome of Syrian elections was largely predetermined.",
      "At the same time, Palestinian factions have had a complicated relationship with Syrian authorities. Former Syrian President Hafez Assad and Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat were bitter adversaries. Many Palestinians were imprisoned for belonging to Arafat's Fatah movement.",
      "Mahmoud Dakhnous, a retired teacher who returned to Yarmouk to check on his demolished house, said he used to be frequently called in for questioning by the Syrian intelligence services.",
      "\u201cDespite their claims that they are with the (Palestinian) resistance, in the media they were, but on the ground the reality was something else,\" he said of the Assad dynasty.",
      "In recent years, the Syrian government began to roll back the right of Palestinians to own and inherit property.",
      "As for the country's new rulers, \u201cwe need more time to judge\u201d their stance toward Syria's Palestinians, Dahknous said.",
      "\u201cBut the signs so far in this week, the positions and proposals that are being put forward by the new government are good for the people and the citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Yarmouk\u2019s Palestinian factions tried to remain neutral when Syria\u2019s civil war broke out, but by late 2012, the camp was pulled into the conflict and different factions took opposing sides.",
      "Since the fall of Assad, the factions have been angling to solidify their relationship with the new government. A group of Palestinian factions said in a statement Wednesday that they had formed a body, headed by the Palestinian ambassador, to manage relations with Syria's new authorities.",
      "The new leadership \u2014 headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamic militant group \u2014 has not officially commented on the status of Palestinian refugees or regarding its stance toward Israel, which the previous Syrian government never recognized.",
      "The Syrian interim government on Friday sent a complaint to the U.N. Security Council denouncing the incursion by Israeli forces into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights and their bombardment of multiple areas in Syria. But HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has said the new administration does not seek a conflict with Israel.",
      "Al-Rifai said the new government's security forces had entered the offices of three Palestinian factions and removed the weapons that were there, but that it was unclear whether there had been an official decision to disarm Palestinian groups.",
      "\u201cWe are fully aware that the new leadership has issues that are more important\u201d than the issue of Palestinian refugees, he said, including \u201cthe issue of stability first.\u201d",
      "For now, he said, Palestinians are hoping for the best. \"We expect the relationship between us to be a better relationship.\u201d",

      "Filipino death row inmate Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso knelt to pray when officers came to take her to an execution site in May 2015, just feet from her isolation cell on an Indonesian prison island, where a 13-member firing squad was waiting",
      "YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia -- Filipino death row inmate Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso knelt to pray when officers came to take her to an execution site in May 2015, just a few feet away from her isolation cell on an Indonesian prison island, where a 13-member firing squad was waiting.",
      "While she prayed, the Philippines government was wrapping up a lengthy legal battle over her fate. Veloso\u2019s life was ultimately spared \u2014 temporarily \u2014 by Indonesia\u2019s Attorney General's Office, which issued a stay of execution shortly before Veloso was to be executed with eight other death row inmates.",
      "\u201cLord, many people there believe that I am guilty, but many people out there believe that I am innocent. Lord, You are the One who knows everything, You knew that I am innocent, so I beg You, please prove that by saving me,\u201d Veloso recalled praying in a tearful interview with The Associated Press at a female prison in Yogyakarta on Tuesday.",
      "The reprieve aimed to provide an opportunity for Veloso's testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking.",
      "Shock washed over Veloso as a group of officials from the attorney general's office informed her of the stay just as she was being led out to the execution site on Nusakambangan prison island. In tears, she remembered a cocoon she saw the previous night hanging from a tree branch near her cell.",
      "\u201cIn the Philippines we believe that if there is a cocoon, there will be a new life,\u201d Veloso said. \u201cThat means I will not be executed because God will give me a new life.\u201d",
      "Veloso, now 39, was arrested in 2010 at the airport in the Indonesian ancient city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death.",
      "Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning interior design and other skills.",
      "Veloso was granted a stay of execution because her alleged boss was arrested in the Philippines, and the authorities there requested Indonesian assistance in pursuing a case against her. The woman, who allegedly recruited Veloso to work in Kuala Lumpur, Maria Kristina Sergio, surrendered to police in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution.",
      "The dramatic turn of events began last month, when in an unusual last-ditch effort to delay Veloso\u2019s death, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that a deal had been reached for Indonesia to send Veloso home after a decade of pleading from Manila.",
      "\u201cMary Jane Veloso is coming home,\u201d Marcos said in a statement. \u201cArrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane\u2019s case has been a long and difficult journey.\u201d",
      "A \u201cpractical arrangement\u201d between Indonesia and the Philippines was signed on Dec. 6, to send Veloso home, which is expected before Christmas.",
      "Although there is no treaty between the countries, Indonesia and the Philippines are both members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the transfer of convicts in the ASEAN region is in accordance with the bloc\u2019s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, said Raul Vasquez, the undersecretary at the Department of Justice of the Philippines, after the signing ceremony.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister for law, human rights, immigration and corrections, lauded the transfer agreement as a \u201chistoric milestone\u201d between Indonesia and the Philippines, and part of the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d policy.",
      "Once repatriated, Mahendra said, if the Philippines want to pardon Veloso or grant clemency, \u201cthat is entirely their authority in which we must also respect,\u201d the minister added. The Philippines, Asia\u2019s largest Roman Catholic nation, has abolished the death penalty.",
      "Veloso described the decision as being \u201clike a miracle when I have lost all hope.\"",
      "\u201cFor almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,\u201d she said, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.\u201d",
      "Born in Cabanatuan, a city in Nueva Ecija province, Veloso was the youngest of five siblings of a family who lived in extreme poverty. Her father worked as a seasonal agricultural worker on a sugar cane plantation and her mother collected discarded bottles and plastic to sell to junk shops. Veloso dropped out of school in her first year of high school and married her husband when she was just 16 years old.",
      "The couple later separated and she became a single mother to two young sons, forcing her to emigrate to Dubai in 2009 to work as maid. She returned to the Philippines before the end of her two-year contract after an attempted rape by her employer. A year later, Veloso was recruited by Sergio to be employed as a domestic servant in Malaysia but later was shifted to Indonesia.",
      "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.",
      "Indonesia's last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad.",
      "There are about 530 people on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data showed as of last month. The Indonesian government recently agreed in principle to return five Australian nationals and a French national to their home countries.",
      "\u201cI was not a good Catholic before, and prison has changed my life into a skilled person who has become closer to God,\u201d Veloso said. \u201cI am ready to build a new life, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.\u201d",

      "AQABA, Jordan -- American officials have been in direct contact with the terrorist-designated rebel group that led the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.",
      "Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia last weekend.",
      "Along with counterparts from eight Arab nations and Turkey and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, Blinken signed off on a set of principles meant to guide Syria\u2019s transition to a peaceful, nonsectarian and inclusive country.",
      "Blinken would not discuss details of the direct contacts with HTS but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period.",
      "\u201cYes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\u201d Blinken said in the port city of Aqaba. He added that \u201cour message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we\u2019re prepared to help them do so.\u201d",
      "HTS, once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018. That designation carries severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group or its members.",
      "The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups.",
      "In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group\u2019s leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus are in touch with Western embassies.",
      "He also said that \"we don\u2019t intend to enter any conflict because there is general exhaustion in Syria.\u201d",
      "HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad\u2019s fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past.",
      "Blinken also stressed that \u201cthe success that we\u2019ve had in ending the territorial caliphate\u201d of the Islamic State group remains \u201ca critical mission.\u201d And citing the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish fighters who in recent years drove IS out of large areas of Syria, he called it \u201dvery important at this moment that they continue that role because this is a moment of instability\u201d in which IS \u201cwill seek to regroup and take advantage of.\u201d",
      "A joint statement after the meeting of foreign ministers urged all parties to cease hostilities in Syria and expressed support for a locally led transitional political process. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want Syria to fall into chaos,\u201d Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told journalists.",
      "A separate statement by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. Their statement condemned Israel\u2019s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a \u201cheinous occupation\u201d and demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "U.S. officials say al-Sharaa has been making welcomed comments about protecting minority and women\u2019s rights but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run.",
      "On Friday, the rebels and Syria\u2019s unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad.",
      "U.S. officials are continuing their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus. \"We have impressed upon everyone we\u2019ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,\u201d Blinken said.",

      "Blinken held meetings Jordan, Turkey and Iraq with the aim of trying to shape the future of post-Assad Syria by forging consensus among regional partners and allies whose interests often diverge.",
      "\u201cWe know that what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders, from mass displacement to terrorism,\" he told reporters Saturday in Aqaba, Jordan. \"And we know that we can\u2019t underestimate the challenges of this moment.\u201d",
      "The primary goal of his 11 previous trips to the region since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023 was securing a ceasefire in Gaza that resulted in the release of remaining hostages.",
      "Now, suddenly, that wasn't his priority and was being handled by President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who traveled to Israel, Egypt and Qatar this past week. Blinken said he used his own meetings to press forward on a ceasefire deal.",
      "Biden's team is running out of time to cement a legacy in the Middle East after drawing widespread criticism that it turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s military conduct and its treatment of civilians in Gaza. They did succeed in helping lead a push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that, while tenuous, is holding.",
      "Here are some takeaways from Blinken's trip:",
      "While hopes remain for concluding a Gaza ceasefire by the time Biden leaves the White House, helping shape a new Syria may prove to be lower-hanging fruit.",
      "Blinken left Washington just three days after Assad fled for Russia, a longtime ally. Blinken said his goal was to convince countries in the Mideast and elsewhere that they should commit to backing the U.S. view of how Syria should be run after decades of Assad family rule.",
      "To that end, he said he had secured the backing of the 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations who held an emergency meeting Saturday on Syria in the Jordanian port city of Aqaba.",
      "They agreed that the new Syrian government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches people in need, and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons.",
      "Blinken has promised that the United States would recognize and support a new government that met those principles.",
      "Syria is riven by partisan and sectarian infighting that led in part to rise of the Islamic State militant group in the first place.",
      "Turkey, Syria\u2019s neighbor to the north, is deeply suspicious of Syrian and Iraqi Kurds. Turkey deems them terrorists, although some of those Kurds have proved to be key American partners in the fight to destroy IS.",
      "The U.S. helped broker an agreement between the Turks and one of those Kurdish groups, the Syrian Defense Forces, after Assad\u2019s departure, although it\u2019s unclear how long that can last.",
      "\u201cWe have the urgency of now,\u201d Blinken said Saturday. \u201cThe urgency of now is to ensure that the success that we\u2019ve had in ending the territorial caliphate of ISIS ... remains a critical mission,\" he said, using a different acronym for the group.",
      "The SDF runs detention facilities holding some 10,000 fighters, and Blinken said its role is key because \"this is a moment of instability in which ISIS will seek to regroup and take advantage of.\u201d",
      "Just after Assad's downfall, the U.S. struck about 75 IS targets in the Syrian desert in an effort to prevent the group from gaining a foothold. The U.S. also has about 900 troops in Syria to battle the group.",
      "There are concerns in the region about how the incoming Trump administration will handle the Middle East, apart from deepening ties with Israel.",
      "Trump has demanded the immediate release of hostages in Gaza, threatening on social media that otherwise there would be \u201cHELL TO PAY,\u201d and has urged the U.S. not to get involved in Syria.",
      "Nonetheless, current U.S. officials believe the Republican is unlikely to abandon American military positions in Syria, as he had wanted to do during his first term. Their belief stems from the fact that Trump frequently takes credit for vanquishing IS by finishing the liberation of their territory that began during the Obama administration.",
      "The threat of the possible return of IS would be too great for Trump risk, according to these officials. They say Iraq, which signed an agreement with the U.S. in September under which the U.S.-led anti-IS coalition will withdraw next year, is already hinting that conditions could force a change in that timetable.",
      "On a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Sullivan expressed cautious optimism that conditions were ripe for halting the long-running conflict before the Biden administration's end.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here now if I didn\u2019t think this thing was just waiting until after Jan. 20,\u201d he said this week.",
      "Sullivan also said there has been good cooperation with the incoming Trump administration, with widespread agreement between them.",
      "Sullivan headed back to Washington on Saturday after holding talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. But he left behind White House senior adviser Brett McGurk to continue talks in the region on reaching a deal to free some 100 hostages, about a third who Israeli officials believe are dead, that remain in captivity in Gaza.",
      "The Biden administration has made it a priority to find Austin Tice, an American journalist believed held in Syria for more than a decade. Since Assad\u2019s ouster, the U.S. has redoubled efforts to find Tice and return him home.",
      "Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. has been in direct contact with the rebels that ousted Assad, including about \u201cthe importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home.\u201d",
      "Washington\u2019s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, traveled to Lebanon this week in hopes of getting information on Tice.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. officials said Friday that another American, Travis Timmerman, was transported by the U.S. military out of Syria, where he had disappeared seven months ago into Assad's prison system. Timmerman was among the thousands released this week.",
      "Officials say Timmerman, 29, was flown to Jordan on a U.S. military helicopter Friday, and it\u2019s unclear where he may go next. He was detained after he crossed into Syria from Lebanon while on a Christian pilgrimage in June."

      "MORONI, Comoros -- MORONI, Comoros (AP) \u2014 Cyclone Chido caused extensive damage on the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, leaving several people dead, officials said Saturday, as the storm roared toward the east coast of Africa.",
      "French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said a \u201cvery provisional\" tally shows there are at least \u201ca few people\u201d who have died. He said he would not yet provide any precise numbers of people killed and injured given rescuers have not yet been able to assess the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid the toll will be high, but for the moment I can\u2019t give any figures,\u201d Retailleau told reporters following an emergency meeting at the interior ministry in Paris. \u201cThe island seems devastated.\"",
      "Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, ripping metal roofs off houses in Mayotte, which has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands that lie about 800 kilometers (497 miles) off Mozambique.",
      "France's new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who was appointed Friday, said public facilities have been \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed\u201d including at the prefecture, the hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced \u201cvery serious risks.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation.",
      "\u201cOur island is being hit by the most violent and destructive cyclone since 1934. Many of us have lost everything,\u201d Mayotte prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville said in a Facebook post Saturday. He said the highest alert had been lifted so that rescuers can help after the worst of the cyclone had passed.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \u201chelp the population and prevent potential looting.\u201d",
      "Some 110 rescuers and firefighters sent to Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion have been deployed and an additional reinforcement of 140 people will be sent on Sunday.",
      "France\u2019s poorest island, Mayotte has previously struggled with drought and underinvestment.",
      "French Transport Minister Fran\u00e7ois Durovray said Mayotte airport was \u201cbadly damaged, particularly the control tower\u201d by the cyclone in a message on X. He said infrastructure on the island had been heavily impacted and air traffic will first be reopened to military aircraft only. Ships are being used to provide supplies.",
      "Mayotte is still under red alert for the ordinary population and people were asked to \u201cremain confined in a solid shelter,\u201d prefect Bieuville said. Only emergency and security services were allowed to go out.",
      "Local broadcaster Mayotte la 1ere said that thousands of homes were without power, tin huts and other small structures had been blown away and many trees had been blown over.",
      "The nation of Comoros, a group of islands north of Mayotte, also was being battered by Chido and the highest alert had been announced in some areas. Authorities said they were concerned for a group of 11 fishermen who had gone out to sea on Monday and had not been heard from.",
      "Comoros authorities have ordered all ships to remain anchored in harbors and have closed the main airport and government offices. Schools were ordered closed on Friday so that people could prepare for the cyclone.",
      "Chido was expected to continue its eastern trajectory and hit Mozambique on the African mainland late Saturday or early Sunday, forecasters said. Mozambique's disaster agency has warned that 2.5 million people might be affected in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula.",
      "And further inland, landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe were also preparing. Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs said it was expecting flooding in some parts and urgently advised some people to move to higher ground. In Zimbabwe, authorities said some people should prepare for evacuation.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years.",
      "Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne cholera disease \u2014 as happened in the aftermath of Idai \u2014 as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to climate change, having to deal with large humanitarian crises.",

      "Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia have killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country\u2019s energy sector in the nearly three-year war.",
      "The boy died when a drone struck his family\u2019s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said.",
      "He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble.",
      "Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine\u2019s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow.",
      "Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country\u2019s south and west the previous night.",
      "The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is \u201cterrorizing millions of people\u201d with such assaults.",
      "According to Ukraine\u2019s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on \u201ccritically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.\u201d",
      "The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday\u2019s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called \u201cswarms.\u201d",
      "Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives.",
      "But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia\u2019s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer.",
      "In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking \u201cnoticeable\u201d losses.",
      "Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine\u2019s south and northeast.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A court in Iran has sentenced Iranian-American journalist Reza Valizadeh to 10 years on prison after finding him guilty of collaborating with a hostile government, his lawyer said Saturday.",
      "Reza Valizadeh is a former journalist for the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America's Farsi language service and also has worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that is overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.",
      "Mohammad Hossein Aghasi, the lawyer of Valizadeh, told The Associated Press that the Tehran Revolutionary Court issued a first-instance verdict for his client on a charge of \u201ccollaborating with the hostile U.S. government.\u201d",

    "summary": "Brazil&rsquo;s federal police have arrested Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a member of former President Jair Bolsonaro&rsquo;s Cabinet, in connection with an alleged coup plot, the Supreme Court said in a statement",
    "story": [
      "Brazil\u2019s federal police have arrested Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a member of former President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Cabinet, in connection with an alleged coup plot, the Supreme Court said in a statement",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Federal Police on Saturday arrested a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Cabinet and his 2022 running mate in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot, the Supreme Court said in a statement.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto was formally accused in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office following his failed 2022 reelection bid.",
      "Prosecutors have yet to file formal charges against Braga Netto. The arrest made on Saturday stemmed from allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement.",
      "The arrest request was authorized by the Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, with a favorable assessment from the Prosecutor-General's office.",
      "A court statement said police formally requested the general to be preventively detained because its agents identified \u201crobust evidence\u201d that he sought to discover what a former Bolsonaro aide, who signed a plea bargain, was telling authorities.",
      "Authorities also executed search and seizure warrants against Braga Netto and his aide, Col. Fl\u00e1vio Botelho Peregrino.",
      "Braga Netto served as Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff from 2020 to 2021 and as defense minister from 2021 to 2022.",
      "His attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Previously, his legal team said they would wait to review police documents before making any statements.",
      "In November, Brazil's Federal Police unsealed the final report of its investigation into the plan to keep Bolsonaro in office by overturning the election of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2022. Federal Police portray Braga Netto as one of the plot\u2019s leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "The 884-page document, substantiated by evidence and testimony, described a multi-step scheme. The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "According to the investigation, the plan included a plot to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Investigators allege Braga Netto greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police said. De Moraes led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned.",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "The Supreme Court's statement said the police had new evidence suggesting that Braga Netto was involved in securing and delivering financial resources for the coup plot.",
      "Braga Netto, the former president and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution.",
      "Reactions to the arrest were divided along the same political line that has split the South American nation since Bolsonaro took power.",
      "Bolsonaro wrote on social media platform X that the arrest was ordered on a questionable basis, while the ex-president's allies railed at authorities for what they called another case of authorities breaking legal norms.",
      "Lula's government and members of his party called it a win for democracy and justice in Brazil.",
      "\"The fact that for the first time in Brazil\u2019s history, a four-star general has been arrested for attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is in itself a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy. Brazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a historic day on this journey,\" Randolfe Rodrigues, a senator in Lula's party, wrote in a post on X."

      "Serbia's president says the United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia, Serbia\u2019s president said Saturday.",
      "President Aleksandar Vucic told state RTS broadcaster that Serbia has been officially informed that the decision on sanctions will come into force on Jan. 1 but that he has so far not received any related documents from the U.S.",
      "There has been no comment from U.S. officials.",
      "Serbia almost entirely depends on Russian gas, which it receives through pipelines in neighboring states. The gas is then distributed by Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft.",
      "Vucic said that after receiving the official documents, \u201cwe will talk to the Americans first, then we go talk to the Russians\u201d to try to reverse the decision. \u201cAt the same time, we will try to preserve our friendly relations with the Russians and not to spoil relations with those who impose sanctions,\u201d he added.",
      "Although formally seeking European Union membership, Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, in part because of the crucial Russian gas deliveries.",
      "Vucic said that despite the embargo threat, \u201d I\u2019m not ready at this moment to discuss potential sanctions against Moscow.\u201d",
      "Asked if the threat of U.S. sanctions against Serbia could change with the arrival of Donald Trump\u2019s administration in January, Vucic said, \u201cWe must first get the (official) documents, and then talk to the current administration, because we are in a hurry.\u201d",
      "The Serbian president is facing one of the biggest threats to more than a decade of his increasingly autocratic rule. Protests have been spreading by university students and others following the collapse last month of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the country\u2019s north that killed 15 people on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and nepotism among state officials led to sloppy work on the building reconstruction, which was part of a wider railroad project with Chinese state companies."

      "U.S. Marines have begun a partial transfer from Okinawa to Guam, 12 years after Japan and the United States agreed on their realignment to reduce the heavy burden of American troop presence on the southern Japanese island",
      "TOKYO -- The partial transfer of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam began on Saturday, 12 years after Japan and the United States agreed on their realignment to reduce the heavy burden of American troop presence on the southern Japanese island, officials said.",
      "The relocation started with 100 members of III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa moving to the Pacific island for the initial logistical work, the U.S. Marine Corps and Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a joint statement.",
      "Under the plan agreed between Tokyo and Washington in April 2012, about 9,000 of the 19,000 Marines currently stationed on Okinawa are to be moved out of Okinawa, including about 4,000 of them to be moved to Guam in phases. Details, including the size and timing of the next transfer, were not immediately released.",
      "The Marine Corps is committed to the defense of Japan and meeting operational requirements to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and it will maintain presence in the region \u201cthrough a combination of stationing and rotating Marines in Japan, Guam and Hawaii,\u201d the joint statement said.",
      "Japan has paid up to $2.8 billion for the building of infrastructure at the U.S. bases on Guam, and the U.S. government will fund the remaining costs. The two governments will continue to cooperate on the development of Camp Blaz, which will serve as the main installation for Marines stationed in Guam.",
      "The Marines and Japan Self Defense Forces will conduct joint training in Guam, the statement said.",
      "Okinawa, which was under U.S. postwar occupation until 1972, is still home to a majority of the more than 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, while 70% of U.S. military facilities are on Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6% of Japanese land.",
      "Many Okinawans have long complained about the heavy U.S. military presence on the island, and say Okinawa faces noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops.",
      "The relocation is likely to be welcomed by local residents, but how much improvement they will feel is uncertain because of the rapid Japanese military buildup on Okinawan islands as a deterrence to threats from China.",
      "The start of the Marines relocation comes at a time of growing anti-U.S. military sentiment following a series of sexual assault cases involving American servicemembers.",
      "On Thursday, a senior Air Force servicemember belonging to the Kadena Air Base was convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenage girl last year, a case that triggered outrage on the island. The Naha District Court sentenced him to five years in prison."

      "The reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral was a solemn celebration of cultural and spiritual renewal",
      "PARIS -- The reopening of Notre Dame was a solemn celebration of cultural and spiritual renewal. Yet for some, the historic cathedral's revival also felt like a meticulously choreographed branding event by LVMH and other luxury conglomerates.",
      "Bernard Arnault, the lowkey billionaire behind luxury powerhouse LVMH and a key Notre Dame donor who regularly tops the list of the world\u2019s richest men, was at the center of the celebration. He was surrounded by his family, the French president, the archbishop and clergy, and the unmistakable symbols of his luxury empire\u2019s influence, including its brands Louis Vuitton and Dior.",
      "France's first lady Brigitte Macron and her U.S. counterpart, Jill Biden, both had Lady Dior handbags. Louis Vuitton artistic director Pharrell Williams performed kitted out in Louis Vuitton. South African soprano Pretty Yende also contributed with a rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d while wearing a Dior gown adorned with 110 carats of diamonds.",
      "Welcome to the \u201cinauguration of the LVMH arena,\u201d commented television journalist Yann Barth\u00e8s about the cathedral ceremony.",
      "LVMH has enjoyed unprecedented visibility in France in 2024, especially as a high-profile sponsor of the Paris 2024 Olympics.",
      "Some questioned the taste of such brand prominence occurring in a sacred space like the beloved Gothic monument, while noting LVMH's crucial contribution to the reconstruction.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t blame monsieur Arnault, a businessman, to do business. But people are now asking if it was an appropriate venue for a display like that,\u201d said fashion PR consultant Theo Fontaine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a great PR year for LVMH \u2014 that's for sure,\u201d Fontaine added. \u201cThe Olympics and now Notre Dame. The whole world has been watching.\u201d",
      "Not far behind Arnault sat representatives of Kering, adding another layer to the ongoing rivalry between France\u2019s two largest luxury conglomerates.",
      "Kering CEO Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault attended alongside his wife, actress Salma Hayek, who wore a tailored Gucci coat. Gucci is Kering-owned.",
      "The event, marking the culmination of an 840 million euro ($882 million) restoration effort following a devastating 2019 fire, brought together global dignitaries and cultural icons.",
      "The restoration united France\u2019s corporate giants. Arnault\u2019s 200 million euro donation was the largest, followed by 100 million euro contributions from Pinault and the Bettencourt-Meyers family of L\u2019Or\u00e9al. Over 250 companies and 2,000 craftspeople contributed to the five-year restoration effort, which reconstructed the spire, repaired vaulted ceilings and restored stained-glass windows.",
      "As the bells of Notre Dame rang out across Paris, the cathedral\u2019s rebirth stood as a testament to collective effort \u2014 but also for some as a symbol of how France\u2019s seats of power and its prized luxury industry are inextricably intertwined.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron welcomed heads of state, including President-elect Donald Trump, Britain\u2019s Prince William and Elon Musk, to a ceremony steeped in tradition \u2014 and high fashion.",
      "Arnault attended with his family, including Dior chair and CEO Delphine Arnault, LVMH image and environment director Antoine Arnault, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy deputy CEO Alexandre Arnault, LVMH Watches CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, and Louis Vuitton product and development director for watches Jean Arnault. Antoine Arnault\u2019s wife, model Natalia Vodianova, was also in attendance.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the outpouring of generosity from all over the world, to which the LVMH Group and my family wanted to contribute from the very beginning, which has enabled the restoration of this jewel of our heritage,\u201d Antoine Arnault said in a statement posted to LinkedIn.",
      "\u201cThis extraordinary project highlighted the excellence of French know-how and the talent of nearly 2,000 architects, workers and craftsmen of all trades,\u201d he added.",
      "Yet, public reaction was mixed",
      "Papuna Biliseishvili, 24, who watched the ceremony in Paris, quipped, \u201cIf the devil wears Prada, the cathedral wears Louis Vuitton and Dior.\u201d",
      "Cari Lefebvre, 27, said \u201cthis is the most PR the Catholic Church has seen in centuries.\u201d",
      "Marie-Claire Dubois, a 45-year-old Catholic worshiper from Paris, expressed her disapproval. \u201cThis is a sacred place. It is beautiful that these companies contributed, but the branding should have remained outside,\" she said \"Notre Dame deserves respect as a house of God, not a showcase for luxury.\u201d",
      "While the grandeur of the reopening sparked debate, Arnault\u2019s donation and LVMH\u2019s contributions to the cathedral restoration\u2014including 36 300-year-old oak trees for the spire\u2014have been widely praised.",
      "LVMH\u2019s influence at the Paris 2024 Olympics further cemented its stellar year. The company crafted custom display cases for 5,000 medals and the Olympic torch, showcasing its artistry and precision. Berluti, another LVMH brand, designed costumes for the opening ceremony, while an Olympic-themed Vogue World fashion show, supported by the group, drew international attention during Paris Couture Week.",
      "Tensions between Arnault and Pinault, the driving forces behind LVMH and Kering respectively, were on full display with their brands\u2019 prominent appearances at the cathedral. This rivalry dates back decades to a bitter bidding war over Gucci in the late 1990s, which Pinault\u2019s Kering ultimately won. Since then, their competition has extended beyond fashion into the realms of art, philanthropy and global influence.",
      "In Notre Dame, French luxury was also championed by the French Catholic church \u2014 and was on display even in the stitch of the liturgical vestments. French fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was called on by the church to design the cathedral\u2019s 2,000 garments. The unorthodox designs were fun, modern \u2014 and perhaps shockingly minimalist. They ensured that even the clergy\u2019s robes reflected high-fashion artistry, further underscoring the intersection of faith and fashion at the event."

      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "Trump, Stephanopoulos and ABC executives signed the settlement agreement on Friday.",
      "The document bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",

      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Serbia's president says the United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia, Serbia\u2019s president said Saturday.",
      "President Aleksandar Vucic told state RTS broadcaster that Serbia has been officially informed that the decision on sanctions will come into force on Jan. 1 but that he has so far not received any related documents from the U.S.",
      "There has been no comment from U.S. officials.",
      "Serbia almost entirely depends on Russian gas, which it receives through pipelines in neighboring states. The gas is then distributed by Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft.",
      "Vucic said that after receiving the official documents, \u201cwe will talk to the Americans first, then we go talk to the Russians\u201d to try to reverse the decision. \u201cAt the same time, we will try to preserve our friendly relations with the Russians and not to spoil relations with those who impose sanctions,\u201d he added.",
      "Although formally seeking European Union membership, Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, in part because of the crucial Russian gas deliveries.",
      "Vucic said that despite the embargo threat, \u201d I\u2019m not ready at this moment to discuss potential sanctions against Moscow.\u201d",
      "Asked if the threat of U.S. sanctions against Serbia could change with the arrival of Donald Trump\u2019s administration in January, Vucic said, \u201cWe must first get the (official) documents, and then talk to the current administration, because we are in a hurry.\u201d",
      "The Serbian president is facing one of the biggest threats to more than a decade of his increasingly autocratic rule.

    "summary": "Mie Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master Japanese sake brewers",
    "story": [
      "Mie Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master Japanese sake brewers",
      "OKAYA, Japan -- Not long after dawn, Japanese sake brewer Mie Takahashi checks the temperature of the mixture fermenting at her family\u2019s 150-year-old sake brewery, Koten, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps.",
      "She stands on an uneven narrow wooden platform over a massive tank containing more than 3,000 liters (800 gallons) of a bubbling soup of steamed rice, water and a rice mold known as koji, and gives it a good mix with a long paddle.",
      "\u201cThe morning hours are crucial in sake making,\u201d said Takahashi, 43. Her brewery is in Nagano prefecture, a region known for its sake making.",
      "Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master sake brewers. Only 33 female toji are registered in Japan\u2019s Toji Guild Association out of more than a thousand breweries nationwide.",
      "That\u2019s more than several decades ago. Women were largely excluded from sake production until after World War II.",
      "Sake making has a history of more than a thousand years, with strong roots in Japan's traditional Shinto religion.",
      "But when the liquor began to be mass produced during the Edo period, from 1603 until 1868, an unspoken rule barred women from breweries.",
      "The reasons behind the ban remain obscure. One theory is that women were considered impure because of menstruation and were therefore excluded from sacred spaces, said Yasuyuki Kishi, vice director of the Sakeology Center at Niigata University.",
      "\u201cAnother theory is that as sake became mass produced, a lot of heavy labor and dangerous tasks were involved,\" he said. \"So the job was seen as inappropriate for women.\u201d",
      "But the gradual breakdown of gender barriers, coupled with a shrinking workforce caused by Japan's fast-aging population, has created space for more women to work in sake production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still mostly a male-dominated industry. But I think now people focus on whether someone has the passion to do it, regardless of gender,\u201d Takahashi said.",
      "She believes mechanization in the brewery is also helping to narrow the gender gap. At Koten, a crane lifts hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of steamed rice in batches and places it onto a cooling conveyor, after which the rice is sucked through a hose and transported to a separate room dedicated to cultivating koji.",
      "\u201cIn the past, all of this would have been done by hand,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cWith the help of machines, more tasks are accessible for women.\u201d",
      "Sake, or nihonshu, is made by fermenting steamed rice with koji mold, which converts starch into sugar. The ancient brewing technique was recognized under UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage earlier this month.",
      "As a child, Takahashi was not allowed to enter her family-owned brewery. But when she turned 15, she was given a tour of the brewery for the first time and was captivated by the fermentation process.",
      "\u201cI saw it bubbling up. It was fascinating to learn that those bubbles were the work of microorganisms that you can\u2019t even see,\u201d said Takahashi, who couldn't drink alcohol at the time because she was underage. \u201cIt smelled really good. I thought it was amazing that this wonderful fragrant sake could be made from just rice and water. So I thought I\u2019d like to try making it myself.\u201d",
      "She pursued a degree in fermentation science at the Tokyo University of Agriculture. After graduation, she decided to return home to become a master brewer. She trained for 10 years under the guidance of her predecessor, and at the age of 34 became a toji at her family brewery.",
      "As the brewery enters the winter peak season, Takahashi oversees a team of seasonal workers and production ramps up. It\u2019s labor-intensive work, hauling and turning large amounts of heavy steamed rice, and mixing thousands of liters (hundreds of gallons) of brew. The master brewer must have the knowledge and skill to carefully control optimal koji mold growth, which needs round-the-clock monitoring.",
      "Despite the intensity, Takahashi manages to encourage camaraderie in the brewery, catching up with the team as they hand-mix koji rice side by side in a hot humid room.",
      "\u201cI was taught that the most important thing is to get along with your team,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cA common saying is that if the atmosphere in the brewery is tense, the sake will turn out harsh, but if things are going well in the brewery, the sake will turn out smooth.\u201d",
      "The inclusion of women plays an important role in the survival of the Japanese sake industry, which has seen a steady decline since its peak in the 1970s.",
      "Domestic alcoholic consumption has dropped, while many smaller breweries struggle to find new master brewers. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, today\u2019s total production volume is about a quarter of what it was 50 years ago.",
      "To remain competitive, Koten is among many Japanese breweries trying to find a wider market both domestically and abroad.",
      "\u201cOur main product has always been dry sake, which local people continue to drink regularly,\" said Takahashi's older brother, Isao Takahashi, who is in charge of the business side of the family operation. \"We\u2019re now exploring making higher value sake as well.\u201d",
      "He supports his sister's experiments \u2013- every year she creates a limited-edition series, Mie Special, that's meant to branch out from their signature dry product.",
      "\u201cMy sister would say she wants to try to make low alcohol content, or she wants to try new yeasts -\u2013 all kinds of new techniques are coming in through her,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my sister to make the sake she wants, and I want to do my best to sell it.\u201d"

      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",
      "Trump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.",
      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt."

      "\u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia\u2019s decades-long cinema ban",
      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different \u2014 and the star of \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d now has an award.",
      "Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award \u2014 and the glitzy festival itself \u2014 is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry.",
      "\u201cMy heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,\u201d Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. \u201cI used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.\u201d",
      "The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training.",
      "The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom\u2019s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world\u2019s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman \u201chas really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don\u2019t see the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens \u2014 by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.)",
      "The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring.",
      "\u201cThese facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,\u201d said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. \u201cToday, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, \u2018I cannot implement my imagination.\u2019\u201d",
      "The facilities are one part of the equation \u2014 the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues.",
      "In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in \u201cMandoob\u201d (\u201cNight Courier\u201d) and changing social norms in \u201cNaga.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that\u2019s what reaches the world,\u201d Elshehri says of the changing shift. \u201cWhen you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.\u201d",
      "But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society.",
      "As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold.",
      "\u201cWe certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. \u201cThe Goat Life,\u201d a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question.",
      "Even \u201cMy Driver and I,\u201d featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship.",
      "Now in 2024, the film is a success story \u2014 a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it.",
      "\u201cI see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,\u201d Dakheelallah said. \u201cWe need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday said it would take up a business-backed appeal that could make it easier to challenge federal regulations, acting in a dispute related to California's nation-leading standards for vehicle emissions.",
      "The justices agreed to hear an appeal filed by fuel producers who object to a waiver granted to California in 2022 by the Environmental Protection Agency during Joe Biden's presidency. The waiver allows California to set more stringent emissions limits than the national standard.",
      "The case won't be argued until the spring, when the Trump administration is certain to take a more industry-friendly approach to the issue. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal and repeal key parts of a landmark 2022 climate law.",
      "The high court will not be reviewing the waiver itself, but instead will look at a preliminary issue, whether fuel producers have legal standing to challenge the EPA waiver.",
      "The federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the companies lacked the right to sue because they produced no evidence that they would be affected by the waiver, which directly affects vehicle manufacturers.",
      "Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and other major automakers already are meeting the California emission standards, the administration noted in court papers.",
      "But the fuel producers told the high court that the appellate decision, if left in place, would \u201cimperil future challenges to administrative action.\u201d",
      "They said they met the legal test for getting into court. As a \u201cmatter of common sense,\u201d lawyers for the companies wrote, automakers would produce fewer electric vehicles and more gas-powered cars if the waiver were set aside, directly affecting how much fuel would be sold.",
      "The EPA waiver was part of the Biden administration's efforts to reverse environmental rollbacks from Trump's first White House term and restore California's authority to set tighter emissions rules.",
      "California has unique authority under the federal Clean Air Act to set tougher standards for cars sold in the nation's largest state, which has prompted automakers to produce more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less climate-damaging tailpipe exhaust.",
      "In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the fuel producers' case as well as a related challenge from Ohio and other Republican-led states and fuel producers. The appeals court hears many challenges to federal regulations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not act on the states' appeal.",
      "The current fight has its roots in a 2019 decision by the Trump administration to rescind the state\u2019s authority. Three years later, with Biden in office, the EPA restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "The EPA could decide as soon as next week on a separate request by California for a waiver allowing it to enforce a rule aimed at banning sales of new gasoline-powered cars in the state by 2035. The rule is stricter than a federal rule adopted this year that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "If the new waiver is granted as expected, it could be short-lived. The incoming Trump administration is likely to move to revoke all California waivers, although that effort could face legal challenges.",
      "An EPA spokesman said Friday that the agency \u201ccontinues to review California\u2019s waiver requests closely to make sure its decisions are durable and grounded in the law. We have no updates to share on timing.\u2019\u2019",
      "Other environmental regulations have not fared well before the conservative-majority court in recent years. In 2022, the justices limited the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a landmark decision. In June, the court halted the agency\u2019s air-pollution-fighting \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule.",
      "Another ruling in June, overturning a decades-old decision known colloquially as Chevron, is also expected to make environmental regulations more difficult to set and keep, along with other federal agency actions.",
      "But the justices also have recently kept in effect environmental regulations to limit planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants, while legal challenges play out.",

      "A pair of conservative groups are challenging a new Maine law that limits donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A pair of conservative groups on Friday challenged a Maine law that limits donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, arguing that money spent to support political expression is \"a vital feature of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the referendum overwhelmingly approved on Election Day fully expected a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs. They hoped the referendum would trigger a case and ultimately prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify the matter of donor limits after the court opened the floodgates to independent spending in its 2010 Citizens United decision.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Dinner Table Action and For Our Future, and supported by the Institute for Free Speech, contends the state law limiting individual super PAC donations to $5,000 and requiring disclosure of donor names runs afoul of that Citizens United legal precedent.",
      "\u201cAll Americans, not just those running for office, have a fundamental First Amendment right to talk about political campaigns,\u201d lawyers wrote in the lawsuit in federal court. \u201cTheir \u2018independent expenditures,\u2019 payments that fund political expression by those who are not running for office but nonetheless have something to say about a campaign, are a vital feature of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of the Maine Citizens to End Super PACs, which pressed for the referendum, said the lawsuit attempts to undermine the will of the people after an overwhelming majority \u2014 74% of voters \u2014 approved the referendum last month.",
      "\u201cSuper PACs are killing the country and in Maine we decided to do something about it. We want to restore public trust in the political process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to say that in Maine we are not resigned to the tide of big money. We are the tide.\u201d",
      "But Alex Titcomb, executive director of Dinner Table Action, argued Friday that the government \u201ccannot restrict independent political speech simply because some voters wish to limit the voices of their fellow citizens.\u201d",
      "Named in the lawsuit are Maine\u2019s attorney general and the state\u2019s campaign spending watchdog, the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices. The ethics commission is reviewing the complaint, said Jonathan Wayne, executive director.",
      "The Maine referendum didn\u2019t attempt to limit spending on behalf of candidates. Instead, it focused on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, contends the U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.",
      "Lessig, whose Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum, previously said the cap on donations imposed by the referendum \"is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d"

      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and best avoid an artificial intelligence \u2018dictatorship\u2019 is now heading to a federal judge",
      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and prevent an artificial intelligence \"dictatorship\" is now heading to a federal judge as Musk seeks to halt the ChatGPT maker's ongoing shift into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",
      "The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk\u2019s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,\u201d says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk\u2019s foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk\u2019s requested order, saying it would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.",
      "Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would \u201cunequivocally have initial control of the company\u201d but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",
      "In the same email, titled \u201cHonest Thoughts,\u201d Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by \u201cpolitical goals.\u201d Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered \u201cOpen Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,\u201d a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the \u201cHonest Thoughts\u201d email that Musk described as the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,\u201d Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.",
      "Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.",
      "Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt \u201ctremendously sad\u201d but also characterized Musk\u2019s legal fight as one about business competition.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Altman said. He also said at the conference that he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence with President-elect Donald Trump. OpenAI said Friday that Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Home shoppers hoping for more attractive mortgage rates next year may be disappointed.",
      "That's the takeaway from several economists' 2025 housing forecasts, most released over the past couple of weeks.",
      "Most of the eight forecasts call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% next year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",
      "That range would be largely in line with where rates have hovered this year. The average rate has gone as low as 6.08% in September \u2014 a 2-year low \u2014 and as high as 7.22% in May, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate was 6.6% this week.",

      "The biggest wildcard for mortgage rates next year is whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s major policy initiatives will end up driving inflation and the national debt higher, which could keep mortgage rates elevated. That's because what happens with inflation, the U.S. deficit and the economy can influence moves in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to price home loans.",
      "Trump says he wants to impose tariffs on foreign goods, lower tax rates and lighten regulations, policies that could rev up the economy, but also fuel inflation and increase U.S. government debt.",
      "Economists at Redfin project that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will hover around 6.8% next year, citing expectations that Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts would increase the U.S. deficit and his tariffs plan could stoke inflation, ultimately pushing mortgage rates higher.",
      "However, mortgage rates could drop to the low-6% range if the economy weakens or if plans for tariffs and tax cuts are dialed back, according to the forecast.",
      "A couple of forecasts are more optimistic about how low the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will go in 2025. Fitch Ratings sees it ranging from 5.8% to 6.4%, while TD Economics predicts the average rate will drop to 5.8% by the end of the year.",
      "The average rate is still below its historical average of 7% going back to 1971. But that\u2019s little consolation to home shoppers now because over the last 10 years home prices have risen much more quickly than incomes.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of having this double whammy on affordability that someone 30 years ago with a 6% rate wasn\u2019t having to deal with,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.",
      "Rates in the 6% range would mean most homeowners with a mortgage would have to take on a higher rate than they currently have if they elected to sell their home and finance another. More than four in five homeowners with a mortgage have an existing rate below 6%, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Economists see some bright spots for homebuyers next year. Those who can afford to buy regardless of where rates are, or who can bypass them altogether by tapping into home equity gains, should benefit from a continued increase in homes for sale and modest pace of home price growth."

      "The move gives the Warriors, who are fifth in the Western Conference at 14-10, another shooter to pair alongside all-time 3-point leader Stephen Curry. Schroder is making 2.5 3-pointers per game this season and shooting 39% from beyond the arc \u2014 both career-bests.",
      "Golden State will become Schroder's eighth team in 12 NBA seasons. He had stints with Atlanta, Oklahoma City, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston, Toronto and Houston before joining the Nets. He also helped lead Germany to the 2023 Basketball World Cup title.",

      "Marshall said it pulled out \u201cafter falling below the roster minimum that was deemed medically safe.\u201d",

      "By Thursday, at least 25 Marshall players had entered the transfer portal.",

      "\u201cAny time coaches leave to take other jobs, it is emotional,\u201d Gibson said at a news conference Thursday. \u201cAnd kids that are 18-to-22 years old are going to make emotional decisions instead of just breathing for a day or two.\u201d",
      "It's the first bowl for Louisiana Tech (5-7) since 2020. The Bulldogs have won two of their last three games, but they haven't played since a 33-0 victory over Kennesaw State on Nov. 30.",

We are looking forward to being in Shreveport for this matchup.\u201d",

      "The Minnesota star forward banked a puck from a sharp angle off the side of Philadelphia Flyers goalie Samuel Ersson\u2019s helmet and into the net in the first period of the Wild's 4-1 win on Saturday.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a skilled player,\u201d Ersson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s luck for him.\u201d",
      "Just over 15 minutes into a scoreless first period, Wild defenseman Jon Merrill fired a shot that caromed off the end boards behind Ersson. The puck ricocheted to Kaprizov, who was about a foot ahead of the goal line, 10 feet to the left of the net.",
      "Ersson slid to his left to cover the post. But firing high from a bad angle, Kaprisov\u2019s shot rattled off the side of Ersson\u2019s head and into the net.",
      "Wild coach John Hines said Kaprizov often works on similar shots for up to 30 minutes a day after practice or pregame skates, and the practice paid off again.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done in a game either,\u201d said Wild goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who faces Kaprizov every day in practice. \u201cSo I\u2019m not surprised. He's fun to watch.\u201d",
      "Kaprizov added an empty-netter with 2:10 remaining \u2014 his 20th of the season \u2014 to move into second-place in the NHL, one behind Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl.",

      "Adam Johnson made as big an impression off the ice as he did on it for the Nottingham Panthers.",
      "The U.K. hockey team officially retired Johnson's No. 47 jersey on Saturday in tribute to the American forward who died after his neck was cut by an opponent\u2019s skate during a game over a year ago.",
      "\u201cAdam was a top player, but he was an even better human being,\u201d Panthers CEO Omar Pacha said at a pre-game ceremony attended by members of Johnson's family.",
      "The Minnesota native, who briefly played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, died shortly after a collision with Sheffield Steelers defenseman Matt Petgrave in the Elite Ice Hockey League in October 2023.",
      "Johnson, who was 29, skated with the puck into Sheffield\u2019s defensive zone. As he pivoted to move inside, Petgrave was skating toward him. Petgrave had another Panthers player in front of him and appears to have made contact. Then, Petgrave\u2019s left skate elevates as the defenseman begins to fall and the blade hits Johnson in the neck.",
      "A man, whose name has not been released, remains under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.",
      "The Panthers announced the jersey retirement a year ago, and on Saturday made it official as Johnson's parents, brother, aunt and fianc\u00e9e watched from ice level.",
      "\u201cAdam was genuine. He was humble, modest, down to earth and never boasted about his accomplishments,\u201d said aunt Lynn DeGrio, who spoke on behalf of the Johnson family. \"He lit up a room with his little smile and quick and witty comments.",
      "\u201cHe loved to dream about what his future was going to look like, right down to the fine details,\u201d she continued. \u201cOne thing he knew for sure is that it would include the love of his life, Ryan Wolfe. They spent hours planning the perfect life together.\u201d",
      "Donations to a memorial account will fund a scholarship for a high school senior to attend the University of Minnesota-Duluth, where Johnson played before turning professional.",
      "\u201cFrom the first minute he stepped on the ice in Nottingham, you could tell his speed and skill was elite,\u201d Pacha told the crowd. \u201cHis hockey IQ was on another level, and he made all the players around him better.\"",
      "Other general managers told Pacha he made the \u201csigning of the summer.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis humble nature was something unique, especially for a player with such a high pedigree,\u201d Pacha added. \u201cPlayers who have played at the highest level can sometimes come with an ego, but Adam did not have this. A quiet, positive leader, a committed player that guys loved and a huge calming presence in the locker room.\u201d",
      "Johnson was living with Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School before his death.",
      "South Yorkshire Police have not determined if charges will be filed \u2014 there could be a variety of reasons for that.",
      "Petgrave, a 32-year-old Canadian, has not made any public statements.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s top league made neck guards mandatory last Jan. 1, two months after Johnson\u2019s death.",

      "Nevin Shapiro, the former Miami booster whose rogue involvement with the school led to a massive NCAA investigation and significant sanctions against the Hurricanes, had his sentence for masterminding a $930 million Ponzi scheme commuted by President Joe Biden.",
      "Shapiro was among the 1,499 recipients of commutations announced by the White House on Friday. Federal records show that Shapiro, who was initially sentenced in 2011 to serve 20 years in prison and repay his jilted investors nearly $83 million, will be officially listed as released on Dec. 22.",
      "Court records show Shapiro has been on home confinement since 2020.",
      "The commutation of his sentence only \u201creduces the period of incarceration,\u201d the Department of Justice said, adding that \u201cit does not imply forgiveness of the underlying offense, but simply remits a portion of the punishment.\u201d",
      "The Shapiro saga is one of the messiest chapters in college sports history. The investigation into Miami took more than 30 months, going back to when Shapiro first contacted the NCAA to essentially boast about his involvement with coaches and athletes at Miami and try to take down people he said betrayed him when he got in legal trouble.",
      "There was even wrongdoing by the NCAA during the probe into Miami. The NCAA's enforcement department \u2014 which does not have subpoena power \u2014 used some information gleaned by an attorney through depositions arranged under the guise of them being part of Shapiro\u2019s bankruptcy case. Because that information was deemed to be ill-gotten by the NCAA, it resulted in some allegations being dropped. The attorney involved was also sanctioned by the Florida Bar.",
      "One of the investigators who worked on the NCAA\u2019s inquiry of Miami athletics even wrote a letter on Shapiro's behalf to a federal judge, just days before he was sentenced.",
      "Shapiro told Yahoo Sports in 2011 that he spent \u201cmillions\u201d on extra benefits for Miami athletes. The NCAA, in its notice of allegations that Miami received in 2013, alleged that Shapiro was responsible for providing about $170,000 in impermissible benefits to Hurricanes athletes, recruits, coaches and others between 2002 and 2010.",
      "Miami self-imposed a number of penalties \u2014 including declining bids to a pair of bowl games and an Atlantic Coast Conference championship game \u2014 plus wound up losing scholarships in football and men's basketball because of the wrongdoing. The school was placed on three years of probation by the NCAA, ending in 2016.",

      "The Anaheim Ducks have traded defenseman Cam Fowler and a fourth-round pick to the St. Louis Blues for minor-league defenseman Jeremie Biakabutuka and a second-round pick",
      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Ducks traded Cam Fowler to the St. Louis Blues on Saturday, abruptly ending the veteran defenseman's 15-season tenure in Anaheim.",
      "The Blues sent a second-round pick in 2027 and minor-league defenseman Jeremie Biakabutuka to Anaheim for a fourth-round pick in 2027 and Fowler, the top-scoring defenseman in Ducks franchise history.",
      "The 33-year-old Fowler was Anaheim's first-round pick in 2010, and he has scored 457 points for the Ducks after making the NHL roster as a teenager. He leads Anaheim in career goals (96), assists (361) and appearances (991) among defensemen.",
      "Anaheim retained about 38.5% of Fowler's remaining contract, which carries a $6.5 million cap hit. He is signed through the 2025-26 season.",
      "Fowler has no goals and four assists in 17 games this season, returning to the lineup in early December after missing a month with an upper-body injury.",
      "\u201cAfter meeting with Cam several times over the last few months, it became clear to both of us it may be time for a change,\u201d Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek said in a statement. \"As usual, Cam handled the process with professionalism and remained committed to the Ducks. Cam and his family deserve nothing but the best going forward, and we wish them the best of luck.\u201d",
      "Only Ryan Getzlaf has played more games in a Ducks uniform than Fowler, a key component of Anaheim's successful run of five consecutive Pacific Division titles and two Western Conference finals appearances from 2013-17. Fowler has been a fixture on the Ducks' blue line since he was 18 years old, and he famously lived with former Anaheim captain Scott Niedermayer's family when he first broke into the NHL.",
      "But the Ducks haven't made the playoffs since 2018, enduring a six-year drought that doesn't appear to be ending this season. Anaheim (10-14-4) is in last place in the Pacific with a five-game losing streak heading into Saturday's game at Columbus.",
      "Fowler has been a steady contributor throughout his career with the Ducks, but he made just one All-Star team during the 2016-17 season, and his offensive production was sometimes sabotaged by defensive mistakes. He seemed to be the obvious choice to become the Ducks' new captain when Getzlaf retired in 2022, but Verbeek elected to go without a captain for two seasons instead.",
      "\u201cThis was a difficult trade to make considering what Cam has meant to this organization,\u201d Verbeek said. \u201cHe has been a valuable and respected member of our team for 15 seasons, representing the Ducks with ultimate class. His character and contributions on and off the ice have, and will continue to leave, a positive impact on our fans and community.\"",
      "The Ducks bolstered their blue line last week by acquiring Rangers captain Jacob Trouba in a trade. Anaheim also has promising young defensemen Pavel Mintyukov, Olen Zellweger and Jackson LaCombe alongside veterans Brian Dumoulin and captain Radko Gudas.",
      "Fowler is joining a team with playoff aspirations. The Blues are 5-2-1 since Jim Montgomery took over behind the bench. St. Louis has missed the past two postseasons.",
      "The 22-year-old Biakabutuka has played five AHL games for the Blues, who signed him in July 2023. He is the nephew of former NFL running back Tim Biakabutuka.",

      "LANDOVER, Md. -- LANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump huddled with allies and a Republican cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre at Saturday's Army-Navy football game, taking in one of the most storied rivalries in college sports while spotlighting his emerging national security team.",
      "Trump was joined by Vice President-elect JD Vance, embattled Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth, potential backup defense secretary option Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and others to watch Navy beat Army 31-13 in the 125th matchup between the service academies.",
      "Daniel Penny, a military veteran who was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide this past week in the chokehold death of an agitated subway rider in New York, also was a guest in the president's suite. Penny was invited by Vance, who accused prosecutors of trying to \u201cruin\" Penny's life by charging the Marine veteran in the death of Jordan Neely in 2023.",
      "Trump arrived at Northwest Stadium just before kickoff and was greeted warmly by the crowd, which erupted in cheers when the president-elect, Vance and Elon Musk, who Trump has appointed to help lead a proposed Department of Government Efficiency, appeared on the scoreboard video screen.",
      "The president, who was seated with his entourage in a stadium suite, mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d and the crowd erupted in a chant of \u201cUSA, USA!\u201d",
      "Trump, who attended Army-Navy games as president-elect in 2016 and during his first term, has been making an increasing number of public appearances before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. He was accompanied by his family and Vance on Thursday as he rang the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized as Time magazine's person of the year.",
      "Trump spent the weeks after the Nov. 5 election holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida assembling a team to help lead his next administration.",
      "He and his aides have become bullish about Hegseth's chances of winning Senate confirmation. The Army combat veteran and former Fox News host's chances of becoming defense secretary had appeared in peril amid allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault and his views on women in combat.",
      "DeSantis, a former Navy lawyer who competed against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, is among the possible replacement candidates Trump has considered if Hegseth's bid fizzles.",
      "But Saturday's game offered Trump a chance to display his commitment to Hegseth's nomination. The embattled nominee even stood with Trump and Vance for the playing of the national anthem.",
      "The mood appeared celebratory for Trump and his team on Saturday.",
      "Hegseth along with fellow Army veterans Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump's incoming national security adviser, and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, posted a short video on X shortly before the game to make their allegiances clear.",
      "\u201cWe love our Navy, except today\u201d said Waltz, a retired Army National Guard colonel who did multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "\u201cGo Army!\" Gabbard added.",
      "Trump also spent time during the game with Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose future could be on shaky ground in the new Trump administration.",
      "Biden last year tapped Brown for a four-year term as the nation\u2019s highest-ranking military officer, but military leaders serve at the pleasure of the president.",
      "Brown, a combat pilot and just the second Black officer to serve as chairman, spoke out after the police killing of George Floyd, a touchstone moment in the Black Lives Matter movement, about the bias he faced in his own life and career.",
      "But Trump has expressed disdain for equity and diversity programs. And his defense secretary pick Hegseth has decried a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda that he argues is undermining U.S. military strength. Hegseth, days before he was announced as Trump's Pentagon nominee, called for firing Brown and generals that have promoted diversity policies in a podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan, a former Navy SEAL.",
      "Trump also made time for Republican lawmakers that he'll need to get his agenda through Congress.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was among the lawmakers that chatted up Trump at the game. He brought with him a contingent of other GOP lawmakers, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Pennsylvania Sen.-elect David McCormick, that vied for face time with the incoming president weeks before Republicans take control of the White House and both branches of Congress.",
      "Johnson, who could be seen talking with the president-elect before kickoff, had said he would discuss with Trump plans for a legislative package that could move through Congress next year with a simple majority in the face of expected Democratic opposition.",
      "Vance brought Penny, a fellow Marine veteran, as his guest. Penny was cleared of criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death after a judge had dismissed a more serious manslaughter charge last week because the jury deadlocked on that count.",
      "The case was a flashpoint in the long-standing debates over racial justice and as well as failures by New York City to address homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with.",
      "\u201cDaniel\u2019s a good guy, and New York\u2019s mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m grateful he accepted my invitation and hope he\u2019s able to have fun and appreciate how much his fellow citizens admire his courage.\u201d",

      "Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili has become president of Georgia as the ruling party tightens its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country\u2019s EU aspirations and a victory for Russia",
      "TBILISI, Georgia -- TBILISI, Georgia (AP) \u2014 Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country\u2019s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.",
      "Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party\u2019s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.",
      "Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow\u2019s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to \u201creset\u201d ties with Russia.",
      "Georgia\u2019s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.",
      "In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow\u2019s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.",
      "Critics have accused Georgian Dream \u2014 established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia \u2014 of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.",
      "Georgian Dream's decision last month to suspend talks on their country's bid to join the European Union added to the opposition's outrage and galvanized protests.",
      "Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia's top diplomat in 2004.",
      "Constitutional changes made the president\u2019s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream's support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.",
      "\u201cI remain your president \u2014 there is no legitimate parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,\u201d she has declared on the social network X. \u201cMy mandate continues.\u201d",
      "Zourabichvili rejects government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.",
      "\u201cWe are not demanding a revolution,\" she told The Associated Press. \u201cWe are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.",
      "\u201cGeorgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen.\u201d",
      "Zourabichvili said Saturday\u2019s vote was a \u201cprovocation\u201d and \u201ca parody\" while a leader of one of Georgia\u2019s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.",
      "Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is \u201cthe only legitimate source of power.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said Kavelashvili\u2019s win \u201cwill make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia\u2019s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,\u201d said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.",
      "Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili \u2014 mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia's opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi's Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.",
      "Kavelashvili was a striker in the English Premier League for Manchester City and played for several soccer clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People\u2019s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.",
      "Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cpursuing the interest of a foreign power,\u201d similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.",
      "The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc\u2019s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the \u201cforeign influence\u201d law.",
      "Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.",
      "Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital\u2019s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.",
      "Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, in a video statement in support of the protests, said Georgia\u2019s \"European dream must not be extinguished.\u201d",
      "\u201cEurope does not seek to sow chaos, Europe does not seek to destabilize or subjugate its neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe voice of Georgians must be listened to and respected.\"",
      "\u2033(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,\u201d protester Sandro Samkharadze said outside Tbilisi\u2019s Parliament building. Another protester waved a sign saying \u201cWe are children of Europe.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators vowed the rallies would continue. \u201cIf (the government) wants to go to Russia, they can go to Russia, because we are not going anywhere. We are staying here,\u201d said protester Kato Kalatozishvili.",

      "Donald Trump is hosting Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Cook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.",
      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",
      "Trump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.",
      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt."

      "A federal appeals court has left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States",
      "A federal appeals court on Friday left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States, rejecting a request made by the company to halt enforcement until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge of the statute.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the nation's highest court will take up the case, though some legal experts have said they expect the justices to weigh in due to the types of novel questions it raises about social media, national security and the First Amendment. TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \u201csave\u201d the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.",
      "The court rejected that request on Friday, calling it \u201cunwarranted.\"",
      "\u201cThe petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,\u201d said the court's order, which was unsigned.",
      "The statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing\u2019s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government\u2019s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.",
      "In the request filed this week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a \u201cmodest delay\u201d in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could \u201cdetermine its position\u201d on the matter.",
      "If the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "The Justice Department had opposed TikTok\u2019s request for a pause, saying in a court filing this week that the parties had already proposed a schedule that was \u201cdesigned for the precise purpose\u201d of allowing Supreme Court review of the law before it took effect.",
      "The appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said."

      "It\u2019s unclear if that buzzing sound coming out of New Jersey is drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward",
      "CHATHAM, N.J. -- That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It's unclear if it's drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.",
      "Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.",
      "This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what's behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey's new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.",
      "More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it\u2019s saying. \u201cLet the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" he posted on his social media site.",
      "But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they're looking into what's happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.",
      "Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.",
      "In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.",
      "The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.",
      "One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it\u2019s otherworldly. \u201cStraight up orbs,\u201d the person says. Others weigh in to say it\u2019s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)",
      "Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she's glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.",
      "\u201cI find myself \u2014 instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house \u2014 checking it,\u201d she said.",
      "She doesn't buy what the governor said, that the drones aren't a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \u201ca national security\u202for public safety\u202fthreat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can you say it\u2019s not posing a threat if you don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why so many people are uneasy.\u201d",
      "Then there's the notion that people could misunderstand what they're seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.",
      "Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they're looking at.",
      "Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.",
      "\u201cIt represents the United States of America in 2024,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.\u201d",
      "Federal officials echo Austin's view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.",
      "That's not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.",
      "For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it\u2019s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.",
      "\u201cMy main goal is I don\u2019t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,\u201d he added.",

      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and prevent an artificial intelligence \"dictatorship\" is now heading to a federal judge as Musk seeks to halt the ChatGPT maker's ongoing shift into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",
      "The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk\u2019s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,\u201d says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk\u2019s foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk\u2019s requested order, saying it would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.",
      "Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would \u201cunequivocally have initial control of the company\u201d but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",
      "In the same email, titled \u201cHonest Thoughts,\u201d Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by \u201cpolitical goals.\u201d Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered \u201cOpen Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,\u201d a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the \u201cHonest Thoughts\u201d email that Musk described as the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,\u201d Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.",
      "Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.",
      "Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt \u201ctremendously sad\u201d but also characterized Musk\u2019s legal fight as one about business competition.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Altman said. He also said at the conference that he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence with President-elect Donald Trump. OpenAI said Friday that Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.",

      "TOMS RIVER, N.J. -- Gov. Phil Murphy has asked the Biden administration to put more resources into an investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have been reported in New Jersey and nearby states.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, made the request in a letter Thursday, noting that state and local law enforcement remain \u201chamstrung\u201d by existing laws and policies in their efforts to successfully counteract any nefarious activity of unmanned aircraft. He posted a copy of the letter on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cThis leaves action surrounding the (drones) squarely on the shoulders of the federal government,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMore federal resources are needed to understand what is behind this activity.\u201d",
      "Murphy and other officials have repeatedly stressed that there is no evidence that the aircraft pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus. The Pentagon also has said they are not U.S. military drones.",
      "The drones have drawn intense public concern and curiosity since residents first reported seeing them last month. Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said from four to 180 aircraft have been reported to authorities since Nov. 18, appearing from dusk till 11 p.m.",
      "The flying objects have been spotted  near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster, but the number of reported sightings has grown greatly since then. Drones were also spotted in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic region.",
      "The FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and other state and federal agencies involved in the investigation have not corroborated any of the reported sightings with electronic detection, and reviews of available images appear to show many of the reported drones are actually manned aircraft. They also say there have been no confirmed sightings in restricted air space. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been seen and reported more than once, officials said.",
      "Some federal lawmakers have called on the military to \u201cshoot down\u201d the drones. The drones also appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "In one case, a medevac helicopter was unable to pick up a seriously injured car accident victim in Branchburg Township in Somerset County late last month due to drones hovering near the planned landing zone, according to NJ.com. The FAA said Thursday that it does not have a report on this incident.",
      "Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use but are subject to local and FAA regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",

    "story": [
      "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
      "You never forget your first time seeing a giant salamander, according to Andy Hill.",
      "He was a teenager, standing thigh-high in the Watauga River outside Boone, North Carolina, casting a line on an early fall day when he saw his first eastern hellbender. The salamander stretched 2 feet long and was camouflaged among rocks beneath the clear water.",
      "\u201cYou never lose your sense of wonder and otherworldliness when you see one,\u201d said Hill, who now works as the Watauga Riverkeeper for MountainTrue, a nonprofit protecting natural ecosystems in western North Carolina, home to part of the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
      "The ancient species, which evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs, was submitted for federal protection Friday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. If the proposal is adopted after a period of public comment, the creatures will be protected under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their population in the U.S. has rapidly declined in recent decades; dams, industry and even flooding worsened by climate change have threatened their habitat and ability to reproduce and find food. Today, just 12% of eastern hellbenders are successfully reproducing.",
      "Hellbenders in the Blue Ridge Mountains had been considered the healthiest population of the eastern subspecies but were devastated this fall by Hurricane Helene. Thousands were displaced or found dead amid rubble. Others were found in flooded church basements and returned to the river. But some rivers are so polluted, there\u2019s still a \u201cdo not touch\u201d advisory for people.",
      "Tierra Curry burst into tears when she learned of the proposed protection.",
      "\u201cI just think it's a moral failure that we're pushing them to the brink of extinction,\u201d said Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The slimy, brown creature with a broad, flat head may never win a beauty contest, but it is famous as the largest amphibian in North America.",
      "The hellbender breathes dissolved oxygen in the water through its skin. Water that becomes slow-moving, warm or polluted holds less oxygen.",
      "Over the past five years, two dams were removed on the Watauga River to help improve water quality and reconnect hellbender communities. The most recent one came down this summer \u2014 and two months later, Helene upended life not just for people, but also for animals like the salamander.",
      "For those working to ensure the species' survival, the newly proposed federal protection couldn't come soon enough, said Erin McCombs, Southeast conservation director for American Rivers.",
      "\u201cWe have to be paying more attention to the health of our nation's rivers and streams, and that means paying more attention to the critters that live in them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen species like the hellbender, which are reliant on free-flowing and clean water, are declining, alarms need to be going off, because we'll feel the impacts next.\u201d",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned and won protection for the Ozark subspecies of hellbenders in 2011 and for Missouri hellbenders, another population of eastern hellbender, in 2021. The group sued, seeking protection for all eastern hellbenders. As of this week, all hellbenders in the U.S. are protected or slated for protection under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Hill says he hopes the new federal protection will usher in \u201cbold strategies\u201d to help the species recover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a massive effort,\" he said.",

      "Associated Press writer Lou Kesten has chosen his top 10 video games of 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been a rough year in the world of video games, which reeled from some high-profile flops (sorry, Suicide Squad and Star Wars fans) and a relentless series of developer layoffs. Fortunately, indie designers stepped up to fill in the gaps. And toward the end of the year, a few AAA studios rallied with ambitious, big-budget adventures.",
      "The top 10 games of 2024 recall a brighter age when it seemed like anything was possible in our virtual worlds. Here\u2019s hoping the industry learns from their success.",
      "In a politically exhausting year, Japan\u2019s Studio Zero pulled off the seemingly impossible: rendering the process of reforming a corrupt world with something resembling \u2026 hope? The corruption that has beset the quasi-medieval Euchronia is quite literal, embodied by hideous mutants known (rather unsubtly) as \u201chumans.\u201d The fight to restore sanity blends stirring battles with unusually thoughtful reflections on justice, all with the eye-popping visuals you\u2019d expect from the creators of the Persona series.",
      "The last few years have brought a surge in so-called \u201cmetroidvanias\u201d \u2014 enormous two-dimensional mazes that blend arcade action with tricky puzzles. Solo designer Billy Basso\u2019s Animal Well is the apex, presenting a vast underground network whose inhabitants range from mice to flamingos. Every challenge you solve opens a smorgasbord of new challenges, and it\u2019s easy to get lost for hours in its eerie, hallucinatory world.",
      "In this drama from Sweden\u2019s Simigo, a young woman is invited to explore a hotel that\u2019s been seemingly abandoned by its owner, an avant-garde filmmaker. Every room has a puzzle, and the more you solve the deeper you fall under its spell. It\u2019s like being trapped in a David Lynch movie, where you\u2019re always questioning the boundaries between dreams and reality.",
      "BioWare, the studio behind landmark role-playing games like Mass Effect and the original Baldur\u2019s Gate, finally returns to its strengths with this fantasy epic. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, with a motley crew of fighters, mages and rogues joining forces against a world-threatening evil. The combat is engaging, the stories are unpredictable and the characters are endearingly loopy.",
      "The most endearing character of the year has to be the adorable protagonist of this adventure from Sony\u2019s Team Asobi. The spunky little robot is on a planet-hopping mission to rescue dozens of his fellow droids, with each stop presenting a fresh assortment of running, jumping and punching challenges. It\u2019s the sort of game we used to see more of on the PlayStation, and it\u2019s thoroughly delightful.",
      "Luisa is a burnt-out corporate drone who needs a break. So why not head to the Alps and cut loose by fighting some monsters? Compared to Metaphor and Dragon Age, the dungeons devised by Austria\u2019s Microbird Games are more tightly focused, given that you can only take a few magic spells on each expedition. But the puzzles are clever, and this oddball tourist town has other intriguing mysteries worth investigating.",
      "More dungeons, as Nintendo returns to Hyrule. At long last you get to play as Princess Zelda, who wields a scepter that allows her to duplicate the tools she needs to surmount obstacles \u2014 or summon creatures to fight her foes. Echoes combines the top-down action of 1987\u2019s original-recipe Zelda with the improvisation of last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d and should satisfy fans of both.",
      "Bethesda Softworks delivers a rarity, a AAA action-adventure in which the protagonist spends more time quietly figuring out the enigmas of the Egyptian pyramids and Vatican City than mindlessly shooting enemies. Veteran voice actor Troy Baker does a fine job standing in for Harrison Ford, the dialog sparkles and the graphics are stunningly detailed. It\u2019s one of 2024\u2019s biggest surprises \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, you do get to punch Nazis.",
      "This indie smash from solo developer LocalThunk looks simple: a solitaire version of poker in which you score points by racking up good hands. Throw in some jokers, though \u2014 say, a \u201cGreedy Joker\u201d that makes diamonds more valuable \u2014 and it gets complicated. The higher your score, the more jokers become available. It\u2019s a classic \u201cjust one more hand\u201d hook; don\u2019t download Balatro if you expect to get anything else done today.",
      "A team of indie developers led by Spelunky designer Derek Yu conjured up this tribute to the games of the 1980s. It\u2019s insanely ambitious, with 50 complete games ranging across every imaginable genre, from shoot-'em-ups to strategy to racing to role-playing. There\u2019s even a Pong variant. It\u2019s a feast for anyone who remembers the dawn of video games \u2014 or is too young to have been there."

      "The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance. The new agreement, signed Friday in Beijing after many months of negotiations, has a narrower scope and additional safeguards to minimize the risk to national security.",
      "The State Department said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails to protect the safety and security of researchers and \"advances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.\u201d",
      "It covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said. This includes technologies related to artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which are considered crucial for economic strength and military supremacy.",
      "China's science and technology ministry also announced the signing, but provided no details or assessment in its one-line statement. The Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this year that such cooperation is mutually beneficial.",
      "The first such agreement was signed in January 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and when China severely lagged behind the U.S. and other Western nations in science and technology.",
      "The agreement was last extended in 2018, and given temporary extensions last year and this year to allow for negotiations. Washington had come to view the agreement as failing to reflect the shift in U.S.-China relations and China\u2019s emergence as a heavyweight in the field. The new agreement extends cooperation for five years.",
      "As the tech war between the two countries has escalated, the U.S. has banned exports of advanced chips to China and restricted U.S. investments in certain technologies that could boost China's military capabilities. Cooperation in science and technology chilled in universities and research institutions after a Trump-era program was introduced to curb China's spying. The program was ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and because of concerns that it had prompted racial profiling.",
      "Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University, said the new agreement would lead to fewer government-to-government programs, but, through its limited scope and stronger safeguards, it would allow for the cooperation to be sustained \u201cthrough a more difficult relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Rep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, said the decades-long cooperation had resulted in the U.S. \u201cproviding all sorts of scientific and technical knowledge to Chinese scientists in what would amount to the greatest outpouring of American scientific and technology expertise in history.\u201d",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, argued that the U.S. and the global community also have benefited from research collaborations that have \u201cprevented diseases, reduced pollution, and deepened our understanding of the Earth's history.\u201d",
      "But Meeks said he favored congressional oversight to ensure projects under the agreement would be in line with U.S. values and interests."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world\u2019s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.",
      "The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.",
      "A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.",
      "New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale\u2019s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d van Helden said in a statement.",
      "All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn\u2019t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.",
      "The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.",
      "Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.",
      "\u201cThese little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It\u2019s remarkable to see this and it\u2019s just another thing that we had no idea about,\u201d van Helden said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week I\u2019ll never forget in my life, it\u2019s certainly a highlight and it\u2019s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,\u201d van Helden added.",
      "The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local M\u0101ori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.",
      "Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.",
      "To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.",
      "The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people\u2019s lives and businesses. And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages.",
      "Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement.",
      "The demand on the grid has not let up, however \u2014 even as Iranians stopped using air conditioners as the weather cooled in the fall and before winter months set in, when people fire up their gas heaters.",
      "Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining \u2014 sucking away huge amounts of power \u2014 has played a part in the outages in Iran.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,\" Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August.",
      "Iran\u2019s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours.",
      "Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation.",
      "Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls.",
      "For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must \"honestly tell the public about the energy situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,\u201d he said in mid-November. \u201cI myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.\"",
      "Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran \u2014 raising questions where the power is going.",
      "In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power.",
      "And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool.",
      "Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer.",
      "Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. \u201cThey distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,\" Alavi said.",
      "In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally.",
      "Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms.",
      "The farms have caused \u201can abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,\u201d Rajabi said.",
      "The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province \u2014 one of the country's chief manufacturing sites.",
      "Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner.",
      "The U.S. Treasury and Israel have targeted bitcoin wallets that they\u2019ve alleged are affiliated with operations run by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to finance allied militant groups in Mideast war zones.",
      "That suggests the Guard itself \u2014 one of the most-powerful forces within Iran \u2014 may be involved in the mining.",
      "In contrast, Iranian media nearly every day report on individual mining operations being raided by police.",
      "Iran may see bitcoin as a hedge against increased pressure from the incoming Trump administration and as regional allies are engulfed in turmoil, said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "\"The question for the economists inside Iran is do we trust this enough to fund the government,\" said Nephew, who has long worked on Iran issues and sanction strategies in the U.S. government.",
      "However, he cautioned against thinking of bitcoin as a magic bullet for Iran, particularly as bitcoin wallets can be targeted in sanctions.",

      "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released in Cambodia recently in just a few days, offering new hope for the survival for the species",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species.",
      "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weigh up to 300 kilograms (661 pounds), or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are only found in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 4,900-kilometer (3,044 mile)-long river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province.",
      "The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades due to rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions.",
      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 2 meters (6.5 feet) that weighed 120 kilograms and 131 kilograms (264 pounds and 288 pounds), respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\u201d said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\u201cThis information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\u201d said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region\u2019s cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",
      "\"Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,\u201d Heng Kong, director of Cambodia\u2019s Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement.",
      "Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray.",
      "That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the \u201cbig fish story of the century for the Mekong\u201d, said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center\u2019s Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong.",
      "\u201cHopefully what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong\u2019s mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cTo continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase, wrote in a letter to the county.",
      "It's not the first time turning Starbase into its own city has been floated. Musk proposed the idea in 2021 when he wrote a social media post that simply said, \u201cCreating the city of Starbase, Texas.\u201d",

      "Drones for commercial and recreational use have grown rapidly in popularity, despite restrictions on who can operate them and where they can be flown.",
      "No-fly zones are enforced around airports, military installations, nuclear plants, certain landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and sports stadiums during games.",
      "Not everybody follows the rules. Sightings at airports have shut down flights in a few instances.",
      "Reported sightings of what appear to be drones flying over New Jersey at night in recent weeks have created anxiety among some residents, in part because it is not clear who is operating them or why. Some state and local officials have called for stricter rules to govern drones.",
      "After receiving reports of drone activity last month near Morris County, New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary bans on drone flights over a golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that is owned by President-elect Donald Trump, and over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base. The FAA says the bans are in response to requests from \u201cfederal security partners.\u201d",
      "The FAA is responsible for the regulations governing their use, and Congress has written some requirements into law.",
      "With a 2018 law, the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, Congress gave certain agencies in the Homeland Security and Justice departments authority to counter threats from unmanned aircraft to protect the safety of certain facilities.",
      "New drones must be outfitted with equipment allowing law enforcement to identify the operator, and Congress gave the agencies the power to detect and take down unmanned aircraft that they consider dangerous.",
      "The law spells out where the counter-drone measures can be used, including \u201cnational special security events\u201d such as presidential inaugurations and other large gatherings of people.",
      "To get a \u201cremote pilot certificate,\u201d you must be at least 16 years old, be proficient in English, pass an aeronautics exam, and not suffer from a \u201dmental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system.\u201d",
      "Yes, but the FAA imposes restrictions on nighttime operations. Most drones are not allowed to fly at night unless they are equipped with anti-collision lights that are visible for at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).",
      "Over the past decade, pilots have reported hundreds of close calls between drones and airplanes including airline jets. In some cases, airplane pilots have had to take evasive action to avoid collisions.",
      "Drones buzzing over a runway caused flights to be stopped at London\u2019s Gatwick Airport during the Christmas travel rush in 2018 and again in May 2023. Police dismissed the idea of shooting down the drones, fearing that stray bullets could kill someone.",
      "Advances in drone technology have made it harder for law enforcement to find rogue drone operators \u2014 bigger drones in particular have more range and power.",
      "Some state and local officials in New Jersey are calling for stronger restrictions because of the recent sightings, and that has the drone industry worried.",
      "Scott Shtofman, director of government affairs at the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said putting more limits on drones could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on \u201ca growing economic engine for the United States.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Are you a YouTube TV subscriber? Your monthly bills are about to get more expensive again.",
      "On Thursday, YouTube announced that it's upping the price of its streaming service's base plan by $10 \u2014 citing \u201cthe rising cost of content\" and other investments. The new $82.99 a month price tag will go into effect starting Jan. 13 for existing subscribers, and immediately for new customers who sign up going forward.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t make these decisions lightly, and we realize this impacts our members,\u201d YouTube wrote on X.",
      "Google's video giant also directed customers to an online FAQ for more information. Those who currently pay discounted prices, for example, won't see the change until their trial or promotional has elapsed.",
      "YouTube TV has rolled out a series of price hikes over the years. When launched back in 2017, the going price of its streaming package was $35 a month. By 2019, that fee rose to $50 \u2014 and has climbed higher and higher since. The last time YouTube TV raised its base price, then to $72.99, was in March 2023.",
      "Earlier increases arrived as YouTube TV added more and more channels for subscribers to stream live. But licensing disputes have also added pressures \u2014 and YouTube has instead attributed its more recent hikes, like those announced both Thursday and last year, to rising operational costs.",
      "YouTube TV currently advertises more than 100 channels from broadcast, cable and regional sports networks, a DVR with unlimited storage and up to six accounts per household with three concurrent streams. And the platform says its latest price increase won't change any of that.",
      "While YouTube TV's live offerings are much different than individual online libraries seen from other popular streamers today, it\u2019s no secret that streaming is getting more expensive overall \u2014 particularly as consumers juggle multiple subscriptions to access all the content they want. In recent years, big names like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Disney+ have all either hikes their prices or added things like ad-supported tiers and password limits.",
      "And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV's new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney\u2019s Hulu + Live TV bundle.",

      "Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies, workers who then allegedly funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missi...",
      "ST. LOUIS -- Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies \u2014 workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday.",
      "The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said.",
      "Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.",
      "Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects.",
      "Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this:",
      "North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those \u201cdomestic enablers,\u201d too.",
      "\u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program.",
      "In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government\u2019s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea\u2019s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy.",
      "In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans \u201cto obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.\u201d The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un \u201chas placed increased focus on education and training\u201d in IT-related subjects.",
      "In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation.",
      "Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. \u201cOne of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,\u201d she said.",
      "Officials didn\u2019t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Neanderthals and humans likely mixed and mingled during a narrow time frame 45,000 years ago, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Researchers analyzed ancient genes to pinpoint the time period, which is slightly more recent than previous estimates for the mating.",
      "Modern humans emerged in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago and eventually spread to Europe, Asia and beyond. Somewhere along the way, they met and mated with Neanderthals, leaving a lasting fingerprint on our genetic code.",
      "Scientists don't know exactly when or how the two groups entangled. But ancient bone fragments and genes are helping scientists figure that out.",

      "To pin down the timeline, researchers peeked at some of the oldest human genes from the skull of a woman, called Zlat\u00fd k\u016f\u0148 or Golden horse for a hill in the Czech Republic where it was found. They also examined bone fragments from an early human population in Ranis, Germany, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) away. They found snippets of Neanderthal DNA that placed the mating at around 45,000 years ago.",
      "In a separate study, researchers tracked signs of Neanderthal in our genetic code over 50,000 years. They found Neanderthal genes related to immunity and metabolism that may have helped early humans survive and thrive outside of Africa.",
      "We still carry Neanderthals' legacy in our DNA. Modern-day genetic quirks linked to skin color, hair color and even nose shape can be traced back to our extinct former neighbors. And our genetic code also contains echoes from another group of extinct human cousins called Denisovans.",
      "Future genetic studies can help scientists detangle exactly what \u2014 and who \u2014 we're made of, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins program who was not involved with the new research.",

      "As in past years, YouTube was the single most popular platform teenagers used \u2014 90% said they watched videos on the site, down slightly from 95% in 2022. Nearly three-quarters said they visit YouTube every day.",
      "There was a slight downward trend in several popular apps teens used. For instance, 63% of teens said they used TikTok, down from 67% and Snapchat slipped to 55% from 59%. This small decline could be due to pandemic-era restrictions easing up and kids having more time to see friends in person, but it's not enough to be truly meaningful.",
      "X saw the biggest decline among teenage users. Only 17% of teenagers said they use X, down from 23% in 2022, the year Elon Musk bought the platform. Reddit held steady at 14%. About 6% of teenagers said they use Threads, Meta's answer to X that launched in 2023.",
      "The report comes as countries around the world are grappling with how to handle the effects of social media on young people's well-being. Australia recently passed a law banning kids under 16 from social networks, though it's unclear how it will be able to enforce the age limit \u2014 and whether it will come with unintended consequences such as isolating vulnerable kids from their peers.",
      "Meta's messaging service WhatsApp was a rare exception in that it saw the number of teenage users increase, to 23% from 17% in 2022.",
      "Pew also asked kids how often they use various online platforms. Small but significant numbers said they are on them \u201calmost constantly.\u201d For YouTube, 15% reported constant use, for TikTok, 16% and for Snapchat, 13%.",
      "As in previous surveys, girls were more likely to use TikTok almost constantly while boys gravitated to YouTube. There was no meaningful gender difference in the use of Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Roughly a quarter of Black and Hispanic teens said they visit TikTok almost constantly, compared with just 8% of white teenagers.",
      "The report was based on a survey of 1,391 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 conducted from Sept. 18 to Oct. 10, 2024."

      "NEW YORK -- Amazon is planning to donate $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund, a move that comes as major tech companies seek to improve their relationship with the incoming president.",
      "A company spokesperson confirmed Thursday evening that the e-commerce giant will also stream Trump's inauguration on its Prime Video service, a separate in-kind donation worth another $1 million.",
      "Earlier in the day, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund.",
      "Amazon's plans were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The report came after Trump said Thursday morning that the company's founder, Jeff Bezos, was planning to visit him in person next week.",
      "The two men had feuded in the past. During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump's past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times' DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect's plans to cut regulations.",
      "In October, Bezos did not allow the Post to endorse a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and to protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper that editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media.",
      "Separately, the donation from Meta, which was also first reported by the Journal, came just weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the offering Thursday.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for Trump\u2019s second term, has said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, wants to support Trump\u2019s economic plans. The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company\u2019s perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but he has voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt.",
      "Still, Trump had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly during the campaign. In July, he posted a message on his own Truth Social platform threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \u201cZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Corporations have traditionally made up a large share of donors to presidential inaugurals, with an exception in 2009, when then-President-elect Barack Obama refused to accept corporate donations. He reversed course for his second inaugural in 2013.",
      "Facebook did not donate to either Biden's 2021 inaugural or Trump\u2019s 2017 inaugural.",
      "Google donated $285,000 each to Trump's first inaugural and Biden\u2019s inaugural, according to Federal Election Commission records. Inaugural committees are required to disclose the source of their fundraising, but not how they spend the money. Microsoft gave $1 million to Obama\u2019s second inaugural, but only $500,000 to Trump in 2017 and Biden in 2021.",
      "Amazon had donated roughly $58,000 to Trump's 2017 inaugural, much lower than than $1 million it now plans to donate. The company also streamed Biden's inauguration on Prime Video in 2021."

      "The conversation followed a tip the FBI received from police in San Francisco, where Mangione\u2019s mother had filed a missing persons report about her son on Nov. 18.",

      "Friedman Agnifilo served as the second-in-command in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office from 2014 to 2021 under former District Attorney Cyrus Vance. A biography on her law firm website says she played a lead role in prosecuting \"high-profile violent crime cases,\" including those involving mental health and cold case homicides.",
      "\u201cKaren Friedman Agnifilo has a three-decade background in criminal justice, litigation, and trials. Her practice focuses on criminal defense in state and federal courts, leveraging her extensive experience prosecuting serious violent crimes, including complex homicide cases, from accusation to investigation to arrest and trial,\u201d her biography says.",
      "\u201cWhile serving in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, Ms. Friedman Agnifilo was also integral to creating the office\u2019s Human Trafficking Unit, Hate Crimes Unit, Antiquities Trafficking Unit, Terrorism Unit, its Cybercrimes and Identity Theft Bureau, as well as working on the creation of Manhattan\u2019s first Mental Health Court,\u201d the biography continued.",
      "Friedman Agnifilo is also a frequent television news guest and commentator and is a former legal analyst for CNN.",
      "She is the co-host of a weekly podcast on the Meidas Touch Network where she discusses emerging legal issues and litigation strategy, and serves as a legal adviser for the television show \"Law and Order.\"",
      "Writings seized",
      "Law enforcement sources have told ABC News that writings seized from the suspect indicate he had been developing a fixation and increasing malice toward UnitedHealthcare and allegedly talked about harming its leader for months.",
      "Some of the entries in the notebook seized from Mangione upon his arrest in Pennsylvania had dates on them going back to mid-2024, the sources said.",
      "That fixation would eventually evolve into an alleged plan to shoot the chief executive, the sources said.",
      "Some of the writings were diary-style, documenting how he felt, what he did that day, and also documented a desire to focus on his health and himself, and find his purpose, the sources said.",
      "Then, as time went on -- as Mangione allegedly fell out of contact with friends and family and grew increasingly isolated -- some of his writings indicated a deterioration in his thinking and state of mind, illustrating a gradual build towards the alleged plan to kill UnitedHealthCare's CEO at their \"annual parasitic bean-counter convention,\" sources said.",
      "Mangione's writings, obtained by ABC News, claimed that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world, but ranks about No. 42 in life expectancy. He said UnitedHealthcare \"has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit.\"",
      "\"I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done,\" he allegedly wrote. \"Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\"",
      "Neither Mangione nor his parents received insurance through UnitedHealthcare, according to UnitedHealth Group.",

      "Kennedy, meanwhile, did not respond to written questions about whether he agrees with revoking approval of the polio vaccine, or if, as health and human services secretary, he would intervene in an FDA review of Siri's petitions.",
      "The polio vaccine available in the United States is recommended for children and three doses offer at least 99% protection against severe disease, including paralysis, according to the CDC. Side effects are usually mild and go away on their own, the agency notes, and the vaccine has not been known to cause serious problems.",
      "Since the late 1980s, global polio cases have decreased by more than 99% alongside increased vaccination efforts to eradicate the disease, from an estimated 350,000 cases to just six reported in 2021, according to the World Health Organization. The efforts have allowed an estimated 20 million people to walk today who would have otherwise been paralyzed and saved more than 1.5 million lives, according to the CDC.",
      "The polio vaccine has been a part of routine childhood schedule for decades, and federal health officials utilize multiple systems to monitor for vaccine safety. Polio can cause lifelong paralysis and up to 10% of children who have paralysis from polio die, as the virus affects the muscles that allow them to breathe, the CDC notes.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, said in a statement provided to reporters that any efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures is not only uninformed, but also dangerous.",
      "\"Like millions of families before them, my parents knew the pain and fear of watching their child struggle with the life-altering diagnosis of polio,\" he said. \"From the age of two, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love. But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine.",
      "McConnell added that efforts to undermine confidence in the vaccine are dangerous and suggested Kennedy should make it clear he doesn\u2019t agree with Siri's views if he wants to be confirmed as health secretary.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on RFK Jr. to \"state his position\" on the matter.",
      "\"This would undoubtedly make America sick again. It's outrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives. RFK Jr. must state his position on this,\" Schumer said in an online post.",

      "\"But I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down. I think a better supply chain is going to bring them down. You know, the supply chain is still broken. It's broken,\" Trump said.",
      "Just last week, Trump told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he won the election because of immigration and the economy.",
      "\"I won on the border, and I won on groceries,\" he told NBC's Kristen Welker. \"Very simple word, groceries. Like almost -- you know, who uses the word? I started using the word -- the groceries. When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We're going to bring those prices way down.\"",
      "Exit polls showed deep discontent with the economy was a big factor in driving voters to Trump.",
      "Inflation spiked to more than 9% during the Biden-Harris administration, a 40-year high. Negative views on the economy plagued President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the share of people saying they've gotten worse off under the current administration surpassing even Great Recession levels, according to exit poll analysis.",
      "Inflation has since cooled to 2.7% as of November. The latest CPI report found some food items like rice, flour and bacon fell over the past year. But the cost of eggs skyrocketed because of an avian flu outbreak.",
      "Trump said he will bring down prices through increasing American energy production, though domestic oil production under the Biden administration reached record levels, as well as through tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "\"We want to do it right,\" Rounds said, making major changes unlikely on Day 1.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who introduced legislation last month to eliminate the Department of Education, told ABC News closing the agency could take \"a couple of years.\"",
      "\"We want to do it right,\" Rounds said, making it unlikely the department will see major changes on Day 1 of the next administration. \"This is not just a 'make noise' bill. This is a serious [bill]. It's taken us a year and a half to write this bill.\"",
      "Rounds' \"Returning Education to Our States\" bill builds on one of President-elect Donald Trump's key campaign promises. It has a road map to elimination, sending block grants to states and redistributing major federal funding to other agencies, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate to pass and then be signed into law.",
      "\"We've tried to set this up so that some of it could be done within reconciliation. Some of it we'll have to gain consensus on by executive order, some of which may very well take 60 votes. So we might not get everything we want,\" Rounds acknowledged.",
      "Rounds said he has not met with or discussed the bill with Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary pick. Meanwhile, Rounds insisted that federal programs affecting vulnerable students and those with special needs will not be gutted.",
      "\"We don't want to lose the specific offices that deliver particular congressionally directed funds, such as special education, IDEA and so forth,\" said Rounds, referencing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \"All of that is included in a redirection to other locations, but all those offices still remain with the focus of sending that money back [to the states].\"",
      "Earlier this week, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a member of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told ABC News that reaching a 60-vote threshold to pass legislation that dismantles the agency would be \"very difficult.\"",
      "\"We need to downsize it,\" Tuberville said. \"More money needs to go back to the states, every state, and you know, we can have a group up here that can -- they can supposedly be the Department of Education, but to have [4,000] or 5,000 people up here makes no sense. I mean, we need to take as much money as we can, put it back in the states, put it back in the schools and give these students a chance.\"",
      "Augustus Mays, vice president for partnerships and engagement at the advocacy group The Education Trust, said block grants could disproportionately affect marginalized students.",
      "\"If you were to take away, or block grant, the funding that goes towards IDEA, then you will have a situation where students with disabilities may not be getting the support they need towards a free and appropriate public education, which is required by law,\" Mays told ABC News.",
      "\"That could be $34 billion from the federal government that would be going out to all these states to support those needs, and states would be picking up that bill. \u2026 [Lawmakers] need to understand what that would actually mean if they were to eliminate Department of Ed,\" he warned.",
      "However, if the president-elect and his Cabinet picks start firing federal employees, education experts suggest it would be too tall a task for a diminished department to administer Education Department funds to states and have states distribute them to school districts. Clare McCann at American University said that is something skilled employees at the Department of Education would be equipped to do.",
      "\"There's a reason the Department of Education was created, and it was to have this kind of in-house expertise and policy background on these [education] issues,\" McCann told ABC News. \"The civil servants who work at the Department of Education are true experts in the field.\"",
      "North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican, said he disagreed with McCann's stance.",
      "\"The goal is more education, right?\" he said. \"And do you need a massive government bureaucracy to do that? Probably not.\"",
      "Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie told ABC News he will also be bringing forward legislation to abolish the Department of Education within the \"first few weeks\" of the 119th Congress.",
      "\"There'll be one sentence -- only thing that will change is the date: The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2026,\" Massie told ABC News.",
      "However, experts have told ABC News that Massie's one-sentence bill may not be realistic as all the funding that currently goes to the department will have to be redirected.",
      "\"The Department of Education administers a whole lot of laws,\" said Neal McCluskey, an education analyst at the libertarian think tank The Cato Institute. \"Those laws have to be changed about who runs student aid and who is tasked with making decisions about cancelling student debt and who decides or who administers Title I and lots of these other federal programs.\"",

      "Negotiations between workers and management are deadlocked over the companies\u2019 plan for further automation of ports, which the union said would eliminate jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on Truth Social. \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\u201d",
      "The vow of support for dockworkers aligns with Trump\u2019s campaign promise to safeguard blue-collar workers threatened by global capitalism, depicting automation as an unwelcome change foisted on workers by foreign-owned shipping firms, some experts said.",
      "Trump\u2019s rejection of automation highlights a tension found in his economic policy, however, some experts added.",
      "Like tariffs, the policy aims to protect a narrow set of workers at the possible expense of importers and consumers, who could suffer higher costs as a result of a missed opportunity to improve the supply chain, some experts said.

      "The Trump transition team did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the labor dispute over automation at East and Gulf Coast docks, and what it says about how Trump may approach the economy in his second term.",

      "The deal includes a 62% wage increase over the life of the six-year contract, but the two sides have yet to finalize it due to a disagreement over plans for further automation.",
      "The standoff centers on the potential installation of cranes that would facilitate the retrieval and storage of freight containers, said John McCown, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for Maritime Strategy who closely tracks the shipping industry.",
      "Cranes already help remove containers from a ship and place it in a nearby port terminal, but shipping companies have sought the use of additional automated cranes once goods have reached land, McCown said.",
      "The cranes work like an old-fashioned juke box, he added. \u201cYou hit a number and it goes to pick a record and play a record,\u201d McCown said, noting the cranes would similarly mechanize sorting and transport of containers.",
      "The U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, the organization representing shipping firms in negotiations, said on Thursday that such automation would improve efficiency and increase capacity. Those enhancements would benefit U.S. companies and consumers that depend on goods from abroad, the group added.",
      "\u201cWe need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,\u201d USMX said in a statement.",

      "The plans have drawn rebuke from the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, or ILA, the union representing dockworkers. The union has pointed to massive profits enjoyed by the shipping firms during the pandemic, saying further automation would invest those gains in job-cutting machinery rather than increased compensation. Workers have also disputed the supposed productivity benefits of the technology.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about safety or productivity -- it\u2019s about job elimination,\u201d ILA President Dennis Daggett, said in a statement earlier this month. The union has proven that the automated cranes at issue \u201care not more productive than traditional equipment operated by human workers,\u201d Daggett added.",

      "What could Trump\u2019s approach to the standoff mean for his 2nd term?",
      "In his social media post backing the workers and opposing port automation, Trump criticized foreign-owned shipping firms for what he described as penny pinching.",
      "\u201cFor the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is time to put AMERICA FIRST!\u201d",
      "The framework presents U.S. workers as victims of foreign companies, which he says aim to make use of America\u2019s economic resources at the expense of its citizens. As such, Trump\u2019s intervention in this case favors the ILA in its longstanding fight against automation, Peter Cole, a professor at Western Illinois University who studies the history of dockworkers, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe ILA will really benefit if in fact Trump pushes employers to back off automation,\u201d Cole said, noting that the explanation offered up by Trump reflects a larger political shift in the U.S. against unrestricted global trade.",
      "\u201cPresidents in both main parties have supported more manufacturing domestically,\u201d Cole said.",
      "However, Trump\u2019s opposition to automation risks imposing higher costs on consumers and even some domestic manufacturers, since advances in productivity would help lower supply costs otherwise passed along to buyers at the end of the chain, some experts said.",
      "Trump mistakenly claims that foreign shipping companies would bear the cost of forgone automation, just as he inaccurately says that foreign countries would pay the cost of tariffs, David Autor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in technological change and the labor force, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe assertion that raising tariffs at our ports will force foreigners to cover these costs is beyond naive,\u201d Autor said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply false.",

      "The only path forward in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case in New York is vacating his conviction and dismissing the case prior to Trump taking office, lawyers for the president-elect argued in a court filing unsealed Friday.",
      "Trump's lawyers, responding to a filing by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unsealed Tuesday, rejected each of Bragg's proposals to preserve the president-elect's conviction while respecting the office of the presidency, accusing Bragg of \"thuggish tactics\" by proposing the judge in the case delay Trump's sentencing until 2029.",
      "\"[A] stay would require President Trump to lead the Country while facing the ongoing threat that this Court and DANY are prepared to impose imprisonment, fines, and other punishment as soon as he leaves Office,\" the filing said. \"To be clear, President Trump will never deviate from the public interest in response to these thuggish tactics.\"",
      "Trump's lawyers also described a plan proposed by Bragg to abate Trump's conviction -- a mechanism generally used when a defendant has died while a case is pending -- as \"unhinged\" and \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"As a further illustration of DA Bragg's desperation to avoid legally mandated dismissal, DANY proposes that the Court pretend as if one of the assassination attempts against President Trump had been successful,\" wrote Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has nominated to top jobs in the Department of Justice.",
      "Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election -- but his sentencing in the case has been indefinitely postponed following his reelection. Trump's lawyers have argued that the entire case should be dismissed because a sitting president is immune from prosecution.",
      "In their filing earlier this week, prosecutors proposed three alternative options to preserve Trump's sentencing while respecting the prohibition on prosecuting presidents, including delaying the sentencing until 2029, abating the sentencing -- which would terminate the case but preserve the record of his conviction -- or sentencing Trump to a punishment that does not include incarceration.",
      "Trump's lawyers rejected each option as unconstitutional and called the case politically motivated, taking the unusual step of citing in the filing's introduction a Truth Social post by Sen. John Fetterman in which the Pennsylvania Democrat called the case an example of \"weaponizing the judiciary.\"",
      "\"DA Bragg's interest in maintaining the jury's verdicts as a notch in whatever belt he plans to wear to campaign events in 2025 is not a basis for interfering with the Executive Branch,\" the filing said.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that delaying the sentencing until Trump leaves office in 2029 would unfairly require Trump to serve as president while the threat of potential imprisonment hangs over him.",
      "\"Staying the proceedings during President Trump's second term would impede the Presidency and give New York County intolerable leverage over the Executive Branch, which exists for the protection of the entire Nation,\" the filing said.",
      "The filing argued that prosecutors' proposal to abate the case would violate Trump's right to appeal, and sentencing Trump to something other than prison or jail would still be a \"grave and impermissible\" danger to the functions of the presidency.",
      "\"One would expect more from a first-year law student, and this is yet another indication that DANY's opposition to this motion has not been undertaken in good faith,\" Trump's lawyers said about the abatement idea.",
      "The filing took an overtly political tone, repeatedly referencing Bragg's 2025 campaign for reelection and accusing the district attorney of politicizing the case \"to defend his poor record.\"",
      "\"It is abundantly clear at this point that DANY will say and do anything -- including urging the Court to disregard the Constitution, the New York Court of Appeals, and the Second Circuit -- to try to make this abomination stick,\" the filing said.",

      "Even though she completed a master\u2019s degree in educational leadership in 2017, Fulton felt that her criminal record disqualified her from applying for principal positions she felt she could handle.",
      "\u201cThe conviction has served as a mental barrier for me, limiting my ability to live a full life,\u201d Fulton said.",
      "Nearly a decade after she first applied for a presidential pardon, Fulton this week received a phone call informing her that it had been granted. \u201cIt was astonishing for me, I wasn\u2019t expecting a call,\u201d Fulton said, adding that the pardon will enable her to explore more career opportunities.",
      "A White House news release commended Fulton as \u201csomeone who goes above and beyond for her community.\u201d For years, Fulton has helped lead a nonprofit supporting at-risk New Orleans youth with hot meals, clothing and shelter and mental health referrals.",
      "Doyle applied for a pardon six years ago. It had been so long that she had all but forgotten about it \u2014 until Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI was in shock,\u201d Doyle said of the call she received from a Justice Department pardon attorney. \u201cAnd honored.\u201d",
      "Doyle, who was once addicted to meth, had pleaded guilty to drug possession and check forging charges when she was 24. She served more than two years in state and federal prison.",

      "Doyle applied for a pardon in 2018 and heard nothing until 2020, when the FBI reached out \u2014 and the vetting began.",
      "\u201cThey talked to my boss, my boss\u2019 boss, they talked to my mother\u2019s boss, they called my doctors,\" Doyle said. \u201cJust pretty much anybody that had any type of relationship with me in the past 20 years they contacted.\u201d",
      "After the vetting was over, she would have to wait some more: four years, it turned out.",
      "\u201cI just want people to know that are in the throes of addiction, or families to know that when they have somebody in their family that is addicted, that there is hope,\u201d Doyle said Thursday. \u201cThis has just brought so much joy to me and my family and is just the continuation of my recovery.\u201d",
      "She has five children and three grandchildren, volunteers in her community, fosters animals and competes in roller derby.",
      "Crundwell was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison in 2013 for stealing about $54 million over two decades when she was in charge of finances for Dixon, Illinois.",

      "Dixon Mayor Glen Hughes said he believes most of the town is probably stunned, and maybe even angry, that Biden would provide clemency to Crundwell. Republican state Sen. Andrew Chesney called Biden\u2019s act \u201cnothing short of a slap in the face to the people of Dixon.\u201d",
      "Dixon, best known as the childhood home of President Ronald Reagan, sued auditors and a bank after Crundwell\u2019s theft was revealed and recovered $40 million in settlements.",
      "Crundwell, who was a horse breeder, told a judge in 2020 that more than $15 million was repaid from the sale of her horses and other assets.",
      "\u201cI am going to do everything possible to make up for my mistakes,\" she told the judge in a handwritten letter that described various health problems. \u201cI have taken responsibility for my actions since the first day.\u201d",
      "Conahan was sentenced to 17 years in prison for helping orchestrate one of the worst judicial scandals in U.S. history: a scheme to send children to for-profit jails in exchange for kickbacks.",
      "Biden\u2019s decision to commute his sentence angered many in northeastern Pennsylvania, from the governor to the families whose children were victimized by the disgraced former judge. Conahan had already served the vast majority of his sentence, which was handed down in 2011.",
      "\u201cI do feel strongly that President Biden got it absolutely wrong and created a lot of pain here in northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said Friday.",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to an attorney who recently represented Conahan, the former judge of the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas.",
      "In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, Conahan and Judge Mark Ciavarella shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and accepted $2.8 million in illegal payments from a friend of Conahan\u2019s who built and co-owned two for-profit lockups.",
      "Sandy Fonzo, whose son killed himself at age 23 after Ciavarella locked him up as a teen, called Conahan\u2019s commutation an \u201cinjustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am shocked and I am hurt,\u201d Fonzo said in a statement provided to The Citizens\u2019 Voice of Wilkes-Barre. \u201cConahan\u2018s actions destroyed families, including mine, and my son\u2018s death is a tragic reminder of the consequences of his abuse of power.\"",
      "The Juvenile Law Center, which represented plaintiffs in a $200 million civil judgment against Conahan and Ciavarella, said it \u201csupported President Biden\u2019s actions\u201d but wants to see the \u201csame kind of compassion and mercy\u201d extended to juvenile defendants around the country.",
      "When he pleaded guilty in 2010, Conahan apologized to the youths he had hurt.",

She served four months in a halfway house, four months of home confinement and three years of probation.",
      "She found out she was pregnant after she\u2019d been out of custody for about a year. She said she had her \u201caha moment\u201d when her son was 1 year old.",

And I just remember, like looking at him and realizing that his whole life was, like, really dependent on what I did with mine.\u201d",

She\u2019s still working in the cell and gene therapy space, now as a postdoctoral researcher at the university.",

She said she does it as part of a program called Prison to Professionals. They help guide people on the unique issues they\u2019ll face in higher education and provide them with a support network.",
      "She said she still doesn\u2019t know exactly how being pardoned and having her record cleared will affect her future.",

      "More than 600,000 people annually visit Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park in the small town of Rovaniemi in Finland",
      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",

      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "A: There are many thousands of people running the airline every day. My job, honestly, over this period isn\u2019t so much about managing the chaos, it's managing really all the challenges, and we'll call it the headwinds that come our way. And I would say the vast majority of those are the uncontrollable.",

We set about coming through the pandemic and coming out that we are going to recover better than any carrier out there.",

Now, to your other question about competitors. I\u2019m not inside the other competitors' operations centers and looking at how they do that. Their networks are set up differently than ours. We do ask ourselves, \u2018OK, if something similar were to happen to us, what would we do?\u2019",
      "A: Weather is always a tough thing to predict. That\u2019s really going to be one of the largest things because it has the potential for having the most impact. Controller-wise, we stay in touch with (the Federal Aviation Administration). We have a team out here that is in constant communication with the FAA, looking at what\u2019s happening in the system, and we\u2019re building contingency plans if they think there are going to be some challenges.",
      "A: The only difference between summer and now is we have to deal with winter weather in some locations. So, deicing. But we\u2019re ready for that. The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",
      "A: No. Boeing needs to be successful, they need to be able to deliver quality aircraft, but we haven't built our schedule for the holiday period that is dependent on getting any deliveries. We have enough buffer built in.",
      "A: Our frequent and premium travelers look at (the technology to catch line-jumpers) as a benefit of being loyal to American Airlines. It's a huge plus for our gate agents because they do like order.",
      "A: No. We just want a steady stream (of passengers) going in. The ability to get overhead bin space ... has gotten a lot better with some of the upgrades that we\u2019ve done with larger overhead bins on the vast majority of our aircraft. We're going to finish up the rest of the fleet in the next couple years with the large overhead bins. So that won\u2019t be the issue, but that used to be a bit of that driver there."

Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisors filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022.

The Washington Post also confirmed the petition. The AP has not independently confirmed the petition, which was filed in 2022, according to the Times.",

      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the Food and Drug Administration is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "Chuck Hildebrandt, 63, of Chicago said he visited the public library in Warren while in town for Thanksgiving, carrying a book titled \u201cBaseball's Zaniest Stars.\u201d He had borrowed it in 1974 as a 13-year-old \u201cbaseball nut\u201d but never returned it.",
      "\u201cWhen you're moving with a bunch of books, you're not examining every book. You throw them in a box and go,\u201d said Hildebrandt, who has lived in many cities. \u201cBut five or six years ago, I was going through the bookshelf and there was a Dewey decimal library number on the book. What is this?\u201d",
      "Inside the book was a slip of paper indicating that it was due back at the Warren library on Dec. 4, 1974. Hildebrandt told The Associated Press that he decided to keep the book until 2024 \u2014 the 50th anniversary \u2014 and then try to return it. He figured the library might want to publicize the long overdue exchange.",
      "He said he recently met library director Oksana Urban, who listened to his pitch. Hildebrandt said he hasn't heard anything since then, though Urban told the Detroit Free Press that all is forgiven.",
      "\"Some people never come back to face the music,\u201d she said of patrons with overdue books. \u201cBut there was really no music to face because he and the book were erased from our system.\u201d",

      "ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E",
      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "Trump, Stephanopoulos and ABC executives signed the settlement agreement on Friday.",
      "The document bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don\u2019t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.",
      "The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.",
      "Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting in November.",

      "In a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor.",
      "An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable but added, \u201cI think there has been a slight overreaction.\u201d",

      "Officials say roughly 70,000 gallons of oil from a pipeline spilled into the ground in Wisconsin",
      "OAKLAND, Wis. -- Roughly 70,000 gallons (264,978 litres) of oil from a pipeline spilled into the ground in Wisconsin, officials said.",
      "The problem was discovered Nov. 11 in Jefferson County, 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) west of Milwaukee, by an Enbridge Energy technician, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, citing a federal accident report.",
      "Enbridge said the spill on the company's Line 6 was caused by a faulty connection on a pump transfer pipe at the Enbridge Cambridge Station. It was an estimated 1,650 barrels, which is equivalent to about 70,000 gallons.",
      "\u201cInvestigation and remediation began immediately upon discovery and continues. Removal of impacted soils is continuing,\u201d spokesperson Juli Kellner said Saturday, adding that 60% of the spill has been removed through excavation.",
      "Kellner said the spill was immediately reported to regulators, though the report by a federal pipeline safety agency said the line likely was leaking for an \"extended period of time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as cleanup and restoration proceed,\" Kellner said.",
      "Line 6 is a 465-mile (748.3-kilometer) pipeline carrying crude oil from Superior, Wisconsin, to a terminal near Griffith, Indiana, according to a company map.",
      "Critics noted the spill was discovered during the same week that Wisconsin regulators approved the first permits for Enbridge's plan to move the aging Line 5 pipeline around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reservation. Opponents said it would still threaten the region\u2019s watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels."

      "Mangione, 26, remained jailed without bail Saturday in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with gun and forgery offenses. Altoona is about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City.",
      "Mangione's lawyer there, Thomas Dickey, has cautioned against prejudging the case and said that his client would contest his extradition to New York.",
      "But Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said Friday that there were indications Mangione may now give up on that fight.",
      "\u201cWe going to continue to press forward on parallel paths, and we'll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he is going to contest extradition,\u201d Bragg said at an unrelated press conference in Times Square.",

      "Trump was joined by Vice President-elect JD Vance, embattled Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth, potential backup defense secretary option Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and others to watch Navy beat Army 31-13 in the 125th matchup between the service academies.",
      "Daniel Penny, a military veteran who was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide this past week in the chokehold death of an agitated subway rider in New York, also was a guest in the president's suite. Penny was invited by Vance, who accused prosecutors of trying to \u201cruin\" Penny's life by charging the Marine veteran in the death of Jordan Neely in 2023.",

      "Trump, who attended Army-Navy games as president-elect in 2016 and during his first term, has been making an increasing number of public appearances before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. He was accompanied by his family and Vance on Thursday as he rang the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized as Time magazine's person of the year.",

      "Hegseth along with fellow Army veterans Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump's incoming national security adviser, and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, posted a short video on X shortly before the game to make their allegiances clear.",

      "But Trump has expressed disdain for equity and diversity programs. And his defense secretary pick Hegseth has decried a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda that he argues is undermining U.S. military strength.

      "Serbia's president says the United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia\u2019s main gas supplier that is controlled by Russia, Serbia\u2019s president said Saturday.",
      "President Aleksandar Vucic told state RTS broadcaster that Serbia has been officially informed that the decision on sanctions will come into force on Jan. 1 but that he has so far not received any related documents from the U.S.",
      "There has been no comment from U.S. officials.",
      "Serbia almost entirely depends on Russian gas, which it receives through pipelines in neighboring states. The gas is then distributed by Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft.",
      "Vucic said that after receiving the official documents, \u201cwe will talk to the Americans first, then we go talk to the Russians\u201d to try to reverse the decision. \u201cAt the same time, we will try to preserve our friendly relations with the Russians and not to spoil relations with those who impose sanctions,\u201d he added.",
      "Although formally seeking European Union membership, Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, in part because of the crucial Russian gas deliveries.",
      "Vucic said that despite the embargo threat, \u201d I\u2019m not ready at this moment to discuss potential sanctions against Moscow.\u201d",
      "Asked if the threat of U.S. sanctions against Serbia could change with the arrival of Donald Trump\u2019s administration in January, Vucic said, \u201cWe must first get the (official) documents, and then talk to the current administration, because we are in a hurry.\u201d",
      "The Serbian president is facing one of the biggest threats to more than a decade of his increasingly autocratic rule. Protests have been spreading by university students and others following the collapse last month of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the country\u2019s north that killed 15 people on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and nepotism among state officials led to sloppy work on the building reconstruction, which was part of a wider railroad project with Chinese state companies."

      "U.S. Marines have begun a partial transfer from Okinawa to Guam, 12 years after Japan and the United States agreed on their realignment to reduce the heavy burden of American troop presence on the southern Japanese island",
      "TOKYO -- The partial transfer of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam began on Saturday, 12 years after Japan and the United States agreed on their realignment to reduce the heavy burden of American troop presence on the southern Japanese island, officials said.",
      "The relocation started with 100 members of III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa moving to the Pacific island for the initial logistical work, the U.S. Marine Corps and Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a joint statement.",
      "Under the plan agreed between Tokyo and Washington in April 2012, about 9,000 of the 19,000 Marines currently stationed on Okinawa are to be moved out of Okinawa, including about 4,000 of them to be moved to Guam in phases. Details, including the size and timing of the next transfer, were not immediately released.",
      "The Marine Corps is committed to the defense of Japan and meeting operational requirements to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and it will maintain presence in the region \u201cthrough a combination of stationing and rotating Marines in Japan, Guam and Hawaii,\u201d the joint statement said.",
      "Japan has paid up to $2.8 billion for the building of infrastructure at the U.S. bases on Guam, and the U.S. government will fund the remaining costs. The two governments will continue to cooperate on the development of Camp Blaz, which will serve as the main installation for Marines stationed in Guam.",
      "The Marines and Japan Self Defense Forces will conduct joint training in Guam, the statement said.",
      "Okinawa, which was under U.S. postwar occupation until 1972, is still home to a majority of the more than 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, while 70% of U.S. military facilities are on Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6% of Japanese land.",
      "Many Okinawans have long complained about the heavy U.S. military presence on the island, and say Okinawa faces noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops.",
      "The relocation is likely to be welcomed by local residents, but how much improvement they will feel is uncertain because of the rapid Japanese military buildup on Okinawan islands as a deterrence to threats from China.",
      "The start of the Marines relocation comes at a time of growing anti-U.S. military sentiment following a series of sexual assault cases involving American servicemembers.",
      "On Thursday, a senior Air Force servicemember belonging to the Kadena Air Base was convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenage girl last year, a case that triggered outrage on the island. The Naha District Court sentenced him to five years in prison.",

      "A woman who accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 13 at an awards show after-party has acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story, while her lawyer said he will continue to vet her claims.",
      "The unnamed woman described being driven from Rochester, New York, to New York City for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000 and then Combs\u2019 limo driver offering her a ride to an after-party, NBC News reported on Friday. She claimed she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault.",
      "But a representative of the Maddens confirmed to NBC that they were on tour in the Midwest during the VMAs, while her father said he doesn\u2019t remember the drive home of more than five hours. The woman\u2019s friend who reportedly drove her to the awards has since died, NBC reported.",
      "The woman had first sued Combs, alleging she was raped at an after-party, and then amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, also was at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z said in a statement that the article proves Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame.",
      "\u201cThis incident didn\u2019t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn\u2019t realize it yet, but, soon.\u201d",
      "Buzbee told The Associated in an email that if someone raises a new issue which didn\u2019t previously exist, his legal team's job is to continue collecting facts and evidence.",
      "Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, asked the court to dismiss the case, saying in a statement, \u201cIt is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press.\u201d",
      "The woman admitted to making \u201csome mistakes\u201d when recalling that night, but said she stands by her allegations.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Teny R. Geragos, said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cYesterday, a lawyer admitted that over 50 people falsely claimed to be victims. Today, for the second time this week, a Buzbee plaintiff has been exposed. This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The unnamed woman said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said Combs and Jay-Z then barged into the room, along with another unnamed celebrity, and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",
      "Jay-Z, a 24-time Grammy award winning rapper, producer and music mogul, anonymously sued Buzbee last month, alleging he was attempting to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Jay-Z said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement, which had the \u201copposite effect\u201d on him.",
      "Buzbee previously said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is \u201cstupid and laughable\u201d and his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation.",
      "Buzbee announced at a news conference in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "His firm, which has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers, began filing a wave of lawsuits against the hip-hop mogul a few weeks later.",
      "Combs was denied bail a third time last month. He has pleaded not guilty to charges he coerced and abused women for years and faces trial in May.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out,\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d",
      "While frequently photographed together at events, they also have been business competitors. Diddy launched his Bad Boy Records around the same time Jay-Z launched his Roc-A-Fella record label."

      "Despite two weeks of U.N.-sponsored talks in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh, the participating 197 nations failed to agree on a plan to deal with global droughts, made longer and more severe by a warming climate",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Despite two weeks of U.N.-sponsored talks in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh, the participating 197 nations failed to agree early Saturday on a plan to deal with global droughts, made longer and more severe by a warming climate.",
      "The biennial talks, known as COP 16 and organized by a UN body that deals with combating desertification and droughts, attempted to create strong global mandates to legally bind and require nations to fund early warning systems and build resilient infrastructure in poorer countries, particularly Africa, which is worst affected by the changes.",
      "The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification released a report earlier this week warning that if global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people \u2014 including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa \u2014 will be affected by the drying of Earth\u2019s lands by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world\u2019s population today. The report also said farming was particularly at risk, which can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide.",
      "This is the fourth time UN talks aimed at getting countries to agree to make more headway on tackling biodiversity loss, climate change and plastic pollution have either failed to reach a consensus or delivered disappointing results this year, worrying many nations, particularly the most vulnerable.",
      "Nations participating in the Riyadh discussions decided to push the can down the road to the 2026 talks, hosted by Mongolia.",
      "\u201cParties need more time to agree on what\u2019s the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,\u201d said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks.",
      "Thiaw said the conference was \u201clike no other\u201d in the talks' 30-year history. \u201cWe have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.\u201d",
      "Longer-lasting solutions to drought \u2014 such as the curbing of climate change \u2014 were not a talking point.",
      "Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world\u2019s largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves.",
      "Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions.",
      "But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will have cost $125 billion worldwide.",
      "Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues.",
      "\u201cWe have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cUntil the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,\u201d said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks.",
      "\u201cI fear, the UNCCD COP 16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year. It failed to deliver,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of young people in Florida is suing the state agency that regulates public utilities in the hopes of forcing the state's energy companies to transition toward renewable energy sources",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A group of young people in Florida say they believe the state\u2019s continued reliance on fossil fuels is a violation of their constitutional rights and are suing the state agency that regulates public utilities in the hopes of forcing the energy companies to transition toward renewable energy sources.",
      "The case is one in a string of lawsuits filed by kids and teenagers across the U.S. in recent years as climate activists turn to the courts for action.",
      "Additional plaintiffs joined the lawsuit against the Florida Public Service Commission this week after it was initially filed in October.",
      "The activists, ages 18 to 25, are taking aim at the agency's practice of routinely approving the long-range plans of public utility companies to continue their reliance on fossil fuels, despite provisions in Florida law outlining the state's intention to \u201creduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by promoting an increased use of renewable energy resources and low-carbon-emitting electric power plants.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs say Florida\u2019s continued use of greenhouse gas-emitting energy sources is fueling deadly heat, flooding rains and rising seas. The lawsuit claims that by furthering the state's dependence on fossil fuels, the commission is violating young people's \u201cfundamental and inalienable right to enjoy and defend life,\" as guaranteed by the Florida Constitution, by threatening their ability to live in the state in the future.",
      "\u201cWhy can\u2019t future generations also enjoy the beauty and unique environment that we have here, just because of what our legislators and our governor and our state agencies are doing?\u201d lead plaintiff Delaney Reynolds said.",
      "A representative for the Public Service Commission said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The plaintiffs, all Miami-Dade County residents, are represented by the public interest law firm Our Children's Trust, which has filed cases in all 50 states advocating for climate action on behalf of young people.",
      "Reynolds and Our Children's Trust teamed up in a previous lawsuit against Florida in 2018, arguing that the state's leaders were failing to act on climate and violating young people's constitutional rights. A judge dismissed that case, saying the issue is a matter for state lawmakers to address, not the courts.",
      "Andrea Rodgers, the lead attorney on the Public Service Commission lawsuit, said the new case will be different because it's much more narrow, asking the court to review specific actions the agency is taking that she said run contrary to renewable energy policies approved by state lawmakers.",
      "\"We\u2019re not asking them to recognize any new constitutional rights. This is clearly established Florida law,\" Rodgers said. \u201cWe simply want to ask them to review the commission\u2019s conduct and tell us whether or not it\u2019s constitutional.\u201d",
      "The law firm has had success in other states.",
      "Earlier this year in a case brought by Our Children\u2019s Trust, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a landmark decision requiring regulators to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions before issuing permits for fossil fuel development.",

    "summary": "Builders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.",
    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't.

      "The UK economy shrank for the second month in a row in October as concerns about the Budget continued to weigh on confidence.",
      "Official figures showed a 0.1% drop, despite expectations that the economy would return to growth after a fall in September.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that activity had stalled or declined with pubs, restaurants and retail among sectors reporting \"weak months\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figure was \"disappointing\", but added: \"We have put in place policies to deliver long-term economic growth.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"This fall in growth shows the stark impact of the chancellor's decisions and continually talking down the economy.\"",
      "KPMG's chief economist Yael\u202fSelfin said that activity was \"held back by uncertainty ahead of the Budget on 30 October\" as businesses and consumers held back on spending.",
      "But some industries, such as real estate, law firms and accountancy, brought forward work before Reeves announced the Budget, the ONS said.",
      "Separately, a survey measuring consumer confidence in December found people were a little more positive about their personal finances for the year ahead.",
      "But the findings from market research firm GfK found that \"views on the economy are unchanged from November which suggests people don't know where we are going\".",
      "\"In a nutshell, it's the continuing uncharitable view on the UK's general economic situation that's suppressing consumer confidence,\" said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK.",
      "Shortly after becoming prime minister in July, Sir Keir Starmer warned that the Budget would be \"painful\" following 14 years of Tory government.",
      "He later denied that he was talking down the economy.",
      "The economy has grown just once over the past five months, ONS figures show.",

      "Royal Mail has been fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "The fine is almost double the penalty the company was hit with last year for the same reason.",
      "Ofcom said Royal Mail's poor service was \"now eroding public trust in one of the UK's oldest institutions\".",

      "\"We are making the necessary changes to deliver for our customers,\" IDS said.",

      "\"Royal Mail has provided an improvement plan, and we're seeing some signs of progress, but it must go further and faster to deliver the service that people expect.\"",
      "Citizens Advice, a charity that offers free financial and legal advice, said \"failing to hit a single delivery target for nearly five years is simply unacceptable\".",
      "\"Letter delays leave millions of people missing urgent medical appointment letters, legal documents and benefit decisions,\" said Tom MacInnes, its director of policy.",

      "Royal Mail was privatised more than a decade ago, but under the Universal Service Obligation it is still legally required to deliver letters across the UK at a set price six days a week.",
      "Under Ofcom's rules, the postal operator is meant to deliver at least 93% of first class mail within one working day, and 98.5% of second class post within three working days.",
      "However, in the year to the end of March it missed both targets, reaching figures of just 74.7% and 92.7% respectively.",
      "Ofcom said the company had blamed its poor performance on its challenging financial position, and on delays to a ballot on a pay deal following strike action by members of the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) last year.",
      "However, Ofcom said: \"We do not consider either of these to be justifiable reasons for Royal Mail's failure to provide the levels of service expected of it.",
      "\"Royal Mail took insufficient and ineffective steps to try and prevent this failure, which is likely to have impacted millions of customers who did not get the service they paid for.\"",
      "The CWU said Royal Mail's poor performance was due to a \"deliberate, sustained dismantling of UK postal services by a failed board and senior management team\" rather than union action.",
      "It said the last day of national strike action was in December 2022, so to partially blame missing delivery targets in 2023-24 on the CWU \"shows the lack of credibility and integrity\" by the board.",
      "Last year, Royal Mail was fined \u00a35.6m for failing to meet delivery targets in 2022-23.",
      "Ofcom said that in addition to the fine, it had been pressing the company to see what it was doing to improve its performance.",
      "While there had been some progress, it said the improvement in 2023-24 had only been marginal and \"it needs to do much better\".",
      "The main reason Ofcom nearly doubled the fine was due to the harm to consumers, a spokesman said, plus the regulator felt it had taken inadequate steps to address its previous concerns.",
      "Universal Service",
      "News of the fine comes at a time when Royal Mail's parent, IDS, is facing a probable takeover by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group.",

      "It made an operating loss of \u00a326m, compared to \u00a3243m the year before.",
      "Ofcom has been looking at ways in which the Universal Service could be reformed. In September, it said it would look at whether changes to second class deliveries, while continuing a six-day-a-week service for first class post, would meet customers' needs.",
      "It had previously suggested Royal Mail could save hundreds of millions of pounds a year if it reduced its mail deliveries to five or even three days a week.",
      "In its response to Ofcom's fine, IDS said it was essential that its own efforts to improve services were backed by \"urgent reform\" of the Universal Service, \"restoring it to a level that meets the needs of today's postal users, not the needs of customers 20 years ago\".",
      "It said this would help to create a \"modern, sustainable and reliable\" postal service.",

    "story": [
      "Diary of a CEO host Steven Bartlett is amplifying harmful health misinformation on his number-one ranked podcast, a BBC investigation has found.",
      "Recent claims from guests - including that cancer can be treated by following a keto diet, rather than proven treatments - were allowed by the Dragons' Den star with little or no challenge. Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",
      "In an analysis of 15 health-related podcast episodes, BBC World Service found each contained an average of 14 harmful health claims that went against extensive scientific evidence.",
      "Flight Studio - the podcast production company owned by Mr Bartlett - said guests were offered \"freedom of expression\" and were \"thoroughly researched\".",
      "The podcast launched in 2017 focusing on entrepreneurship and business. It soared in popularity as figures such as influencer Molly Mae and Airbnb founder Brian Chesky shared their tips for success.",
      "But in the past 18 months, Mr Bartlett has concentrated more on health, with guests presented as leading experts in their fields. Their views receive little challenge.",
      "The interviews are also posted to Mr Bartlett's YouTube channel, which has seven million subscribers. Since this content shift last year, its monthly views have increased from nine million to 15 million.",
      "Mr Bartlett told The Times in April he expected his podcast to make \u00a320m this year, mainly from advertising.",
      "We looked at the 23 health-related episodes released between April and November this year, fact checking - with four medical experts - 15 which contained potentially harmful claims.",
      "The experts we spoke to were cancer research professor David Grimes, public confidence in healthcare professor Heidi Larson, NHS diabetes adviser Dr Partha Kar and surgeon Dr Liz O'Riordan.",
      "We recorded harmful claims as advice that, if followed, could lead to negative health outcomes.",
      "In that eight-month window, some guests billed as health experts shared accurate information, but most were spreading misleading claims. These included:",

      "Podcasters may claim they are sharing information, but they are actually sharing harmful misinformation, says Dr David Grimes from Trinity College Dublin.",
      "\"That's a very different and not empowering thing. It actually imperils all our health,\" he says.",
      "Podcasts in the UK are not regulated by the media regulator Ofcom - which sets rules on accuracy and impartiality. So Mr Bartlett is not breaking any broadcasting rules.",
      "In a July episode, Mr Bartlett spoke to Aseem Malhotra, a doctor who became known during the pandemic for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines.",
      "In the episode, Dr Malhotra says the \"Covid vaccine was a net negative for society\". Analysis by the World Health Organization shows that it saved many lives during the pandemic.",
      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",
      "In many of the podcast episodes, the guests claimed to know a simple solution to health issues which they believed mainstream institutions were hiding from the public. They often also advertised their products on the podcast.",
      "Cancer researcher Dr Thomas Seyfried appeared on the podcast in October. He is a proponent of using the ketogenic diet, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat, to treat cancer.",
      "But Dr Grimes told us doctors warned patients against restricting their diet while undergoing cancer treatment.",
      "\"You could potentially and very realistically get very, very, sick and have a much worse health outcome than if you followed recommended advice from your oncologists,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast, Dr Seyfried also suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy only improved patients' lifespan by one-to-two months, comparing modern cancer treatments to \"medieval cures\".",
      "Mr Bartlett did not react to this claim.",
      "Cancer Research UK statistics show that UK cancer survival has doubled in the past 50 years. In the US, the cancer death rate has declined 33% since 1990, thanks to modern treatments.",
      "Dr Thomas Seyfried told us he \"stands by the statements that he made in the interview\".",
      "The solutions these guests are offering are appealing to listeners as they feel tangible and come without the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, says Prof Heidi Larson, an expert in public confidence in healthcare.",
      "\"But they [the guests] are way overstretching. It sends people away from evidence-based medicine. They stop doing things that might have some side effects, even though it could save their life.\"",
      "C\u00e9cile Simmons, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a think tank specialising in disinformation research, believes this type of content can help to grow audiences.",
      "\"Health-related clickbait content with scary titles does really well online with the algorithm amplifying that,\" she said.",

      "In January, on BBC Two's Dragons' Den - where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch business ideas to five multimillionaire investors, including Mr Bartlett - he invested in \"Ear Seeds\", acupuncture beads placed in the ear which falsely claim to cure chronic fatigue condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).",
      "After complaints, the BBC has since added a disclaimer in the episode and on iPlayer, stating the \"Ear Seeds\" are not intended as a cure, and medical guidance should be followed for ME.",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC declined to comment.",

      "\"He has financial stakes in health and wellness companies. And once you have financial interests, you have then the further interest in focusing on health and nutrition,\" says Ms Simmons.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump stood on Wall Street on Thursday, a euphoric crowd of America's business elite assembled before him, and hammered the bell to kick off morning stock market trading.",
      "The mood was celebratory. Not only had the president-elect just been named Time person of the year, but the stock market, already up strongly, has surged to new heights since his election.",
      "For Trump, whose public appearances have been relatively sparing since his election win last month, the visit was a reminder of the high value he places on market opinion.",
      "But whether history will look back on his appearance as the well-timed heralding of another economic boom - or a death knell - remains to be seen.",
      "Trump is entering office with a US economy that is, in the recent words of America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell, the envy of many other countries, with solid growth of 2.8%, unemployment near historic lows of 4.2% and that mysterious ingredient known as \"productivity\" on a tear.",
      "It has combined to push American stocks to record levels: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to end the year up more than 17%.",
      "The S&P 500, a bigger index made up of America's 500 largest companies, has surged 28% since January, while the Nasdaq, where tech firms have a major presence, has rallied more than 40%.",

      "At the stock exchange on Thursday,  a who's who of the business world, including Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and Target chief Brian Cornell, had assembled. The president-elect was greeted with sustained applause and whistles, which later gave way to chants of \"USA! USA!\"",

      "But analysts have warned that current highs may be difficult to sustain in the year ahead.",
      "Job creation is already slowing and price inflation is proving stubborn.",
      "Many of Trump's priorities - including slashing government spending, erecting stiff, broad-based trade barriers and embarking on mass deportations of migrants - if enacted, could pose further challenges to growth.",
      "Though debate is ongoing about how much the president actually will do, the proposals are generating uncertainty and have the potential for significant disruption, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.",
      "\"The totality of the policies, if implemented to the degree that the president has articulated, I think will be problematic for the economy,\" he said.",
      "At the stock exchange on Thursday, Trump kept his comments focused on other parts of his agenda more palatable to markets: his promises to lower taxes from 21% to 15% for businesses manufacturing in America, cut regulation and speed up government approvals.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant - I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think?\" he said, to laughter.",
      "Similar policies, which Zandi said would be good for the corporate bottom line, if not necessarily the economy, boosted share prices significantly during Trump's first term.",
      "He cited those gains repeatedly as a sign of his administration's success, especially at the start.",
      "But the market retreated during trade wars with allies and with China - then nose-dived at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before rapidly recovering.",
      "Ultimately, the S&P 500 gained more than 67% on his watch - a record bested by presidents Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Barack Obama during his first four years.",
      "Under Biden, the index has risen 59% so far. Whether Trump can repeat that performance is something he has declined to predict.",
      "The main US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq dipping by around 0.5%.",
      "Asked at the stock exchange what investors should be buying in anticipation of the future, Trump, somewhat uncharacteristically, demurred.",
      "\"I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something\", he said, then added, \"Long term, this is going to be a country like no other.\""

      "A British hedge fund trader has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in Denmark, after being found guilty of orchestrating a tax fraud that cost the Danish government more than \u00a31bn.",
      "It is the heaviest penalty ever given out in Denmark for a fraud case.",
      "In addition to the prison term, financier Sanjay Shah, who was the founder of London-based hedge fund Solo Capital Partners, received a permanent entry ban to Denmark and will have assets worth $1bn (DKK 7.2bn) seized, as well as a string of properties.",

      "Shah had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, arguing that he had used a legal loophole. His defence attorneys had tried several times to get the case dismissed.",
      "Danish prosecutor Marie Tullin told the BBC that the maximum sentence given to Shah reflected, \"the extraordinarily big amount, the time it had gone on, and his role in it managing it all, over several years committing this fraud against the Danish state.\"",
      "\"It is by far the largest [fraud] in terms of amount,\" she added. \"I think also the sentence speaks for itself, in that it is a crime haven't seen in this magnitude before.\"",
      "Before his arrest, Shah had been living in Dubai, where he was reportedly known for throwing lavish parties and had hosted concerts for his autism charity, with performances by major celebrities.",
      "He was arrested in 2022 and extradited from the United Arab Emirates to Denmark in December last year.",
      "According to Reuters, so-called cum-ex trading schemes have flourished since the 2008 financial crisis, with Germany, Belgium, and Denmark among the European countries most affected.",
      "The schemes typically involve the rapid sale of large volumes of shares from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend, enabling duplicated claims of the withholding tax.",
      "Previously the Danish government has said cum-ex schemes have cost it more than $1.8bn (12.7bn DKK). Shah was one of nine British and US nationals accused of defrauding the state.",
      "Shah also faces a parallel civil tax fraud case in London, filed by the Danish tax authority, that is due to conclude in April.",
      "As he exited the court escorted by police officers, wearing his Santa Claus hat once more, Shah shot a smile towards reporters, and said, \"See you next year.\""

    "story": [
      "Energy firms will be forced to offer customers tariffs with no standing charges, under a proposed shake-up of bills by regulator Ofgem.",
      "All households pay the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, but there have been widespread calls for these fees to be scrapped.",
      "Ofgem is proposing suppliers offer one price-capped tariff that includes the standing charge, and another that loads these costs on energy usage charges instead. Customers could choose which suits them best.",
      "The planned overhaul, for next winter, also raises the possibility of some unpaid bills that built up during a recent high-price crisis to be written off.",
      "Standing charge anger",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",
      "The majority were against standing charges - fixed fees, typically totalling more than \u00a3300 a year, that are paid irrespective of how much energy households use.",
      "Under Ofgem's price cap, standing charges have risen by 43% since 2019.",
      "Those with low energy usage, such as people who live alone, argued that even if they further reduced how much gas and electricity they used, they saw little difference in their bills. They wanted more control over their bills.",
      "However, those with high energy needs could see a big rise in bills were these charges to be included in the price of each unit of energy used. It would mean higher bills for people with disabilities who have to charge up specialist equipment.",
      "\"We hear from people who've turned off their heating, ration their hot water, and avoid charging essential mobility devices, yet still feel like they're fighting a losing battle with their energy bills,\" said Alex Belsham-Harris from Citizens Advice.",
      "Ofgem's proposed solution is to tell energy firms to make a dual pricing offer - one with, and one without, a standing charge. The tariff without a standing charge would have a higher price for each unit of energy. Both would fall under the existing price cap system.",
      "Such tariffs already exist, but only from a handful of suppliers and are not available to everyone.",
      "Customers would need to make a choice, but some campaigners want those with low energy use to automatically move on to a deal free of standing charges.",
      "\"The problem with presenting a choice of price caps is many vulnerable people won't make that choice,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert.",
      "One of those who could benefit would be Joanne Wilkinson.",
      "\"I try not to look [at the standing charges] because it's depressing,\" she said.",
      "She said she had enough to worry about dealing with baby daughter Adeline, but noticed how quickly the meter goes through the money that was loaded on to it.",
      "Lower wages in the north of England made it even harder for parents like her to afford energy bills, she said, especially as she was still on maternity leave.",
      "But Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that such a fundamental proposed change needed careful consideration.",
      "\"It would be a major undertaking to make all customers aware of this change and to ensure they then choose the best option for their circumstances,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Dhara Vyas.",
      "She told the BBC the addition of a zero standing charge price cap option would \"quite significantly change the nature of the price cap\".",
      "\"It would go from being one single regulated price that gives customers protection whether or not they switch, to a situation where I think customers might be expected to make an active choice about which cap they are on.\"",
      "Asked whether standing charges should be scrapped altogether, Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told the BBC the option had been looked at, but added the costs \"need to appear in bills somewhere\".",
      "He said moving costs into unit rates could have \"some quite bad effects on people in some of the most vulnerable situations\".",
      "The regulator's proposals do not deal with the variation of standing charges in different parts of the UK, with billpayers in some areas paying considerably more. Ofgem intends to make that part of a wider, separate inquiry.",
      "Debt repayment plan",
      "The amount of money owed to suppliers by customers has nearly doubled in two years, now totalling about \u00a33.8bn.",
      "The regulator is also setting out a plan for next winter that would deal with some of this debt, built up during a period of high prices, that has little chance of being repaid.",
      "It is planning a \"debt guarantee\" to improve the standard of service offered by suppliers supporting customers in debt, which it said would give households \"consistent, compassionate and tailored support\".",
      "Suppliers could also be required to accept debt repayment offers from reputable third parties such as debt advice agencies or consumer organisations."

      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",

      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",

      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",

      "Shadey says it was \"the last phase of youth clubs\" when he was growing up, describing the centres as little more than a warm space.",
      "\"We felt this was ending, things were closing down, derelict buildings, old PlayStation games, nothing being updated.",
      "\"That's not enough to keep a young person engaged. They want to learn and grow and be a part of something.\"",
      "Lauren agrees that access is a \"huge barrier\".",
      "\"You can dream about being an artist but if you don't actually have a place where you can go and create and learn, then that really is never going to become a reality.\"",
      "The 15 youth hubs which will be receiving the money haven't yet been decided - although according to Matt the funding could be allocated as soon as Christmas.",
      "Youth Music says it will be targeting programmes and centres across the UK it already works with.",
      "\"It's very important these aren't just based in major cities because we know these spaces are important to youth all over the place,\" says Lauren.",
      "For Shadey, he hopes projects like this will help with what he sees as the biggest problem facing young people: feeling \"disconnected\" from the areas where they live.",
      "\"Feeling like they don't belong,\" he says.",
      "Spotify and monetising music",
      "Youth Music's stated mission isn't just to help marginalised young people make music, it's also to help them monetise it.",
      "And Spotify has a reputation - it says an unfair one - for not being very profitable for artists.",
      "The platform pays royalties to copyright holders and while sometimes that's the artist, it often means publishers and labels.",
      "Last year, 1,000 British artists were streamed enough to be paid \u00a3100,000 but on average they would only pocket 16% of what they earn from the app, all while Spotify reports record breaking billion dollar profits.",
      "Spotify says UK recording artists made \u00a3750 million in royalties from streaming last year and it has no say in how the money's split - that's an agreement between the artists and their management.",
      "Copyright holders are also not paid at all if their song is streamed fewer than 1,000 times in a year.",
      "Matt says squaring that with Youth Music's ethos of helping artists monetise their work was something the charity had to \"think about\".",
      "\"The debate about how artists, particularly emerging artists, make a living is very, very live,\" he says.",
      "\"You make a judgement call that in the end, this is going to make a difference for young people and their lives in music at this urgent time.\"",
      "Lauren acknowledges this scheme is more targeted at opening that initial door for artists of the future than sustaining a career in the industry.",
      "\"To basically provide opportunities for them to learn and grow and connect and be nurtured so they can actually even imagine becoming an artist and making a livelihood off it,\" she says.",
      "Spotify isn't the only private company that's announced schemes aimed at filling the gap in youth services this year.",
      "Working with BBC Children in Need and fronted by rapper AJ Tracey, McDonald's launched its Makin' It project, partnering restaurants with youth workers so they can host workshops and drop-in sessions.",
      "And in south London, Stormzy set up a youth club in partnership with Adidas earlier this year, something Lauren says inspired Spotify.",
      "\"It's great these bigger companies are coming in and investing in those communities as part of their corporate social responsibility,\" says Shadey.",
      "\"But the depth is only gonna be seen if they partner with community leaders and grassroots organisations so it's authentic.\"",
      "Stormzy's Merky FC is a state-of-the-art facility with a full-size football pitch, recording studio and gaming centre and the rapper told the BBC he'd be a regular visitor, providing songwriting masterclasses and gaming.",
      "Spotify on the other hand will be taking a more hands-off approach and won't be involved in the Youth Music scheme beyond the funding they've pledged.",
      "But Shadey thinks the power of brand alone will draw people in.",
      "His Mirror Mirror project supported 60 young people - all of whom had to apply - and provided trips to 1Xtra and Abbey Road studios and the Houses of Parliament to give them a taste of the music industry.",
      "\"I think youth clubs today need to create that same model where people know it's a privilege, they know it's an opportunity.\"",
      "While this project has some government support, Matt says the charity would prefer not to rely so much on private investment.",
      "\"Short term funding, it's great at the time but you're always planning for the next days without getting that longer term certainty,\" he says.",

      "Recent claims from guests - including that cancer can be treated by following a keto diet, rather than proven treatments - were allowed by the Dragons' Den star with little or no challenge. Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",

      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 17:42:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Lancaster also says she \"didn't realise\" her husband Sir Rod Stewart had posted online about Wallace.",
    "story": [
      "Model Penny Lancaster has claimed that she was both a \"witness\" and \"victim\" to \"bullying\" behaviour by former MasterChef host, Gregg Wallace.",
      "It is the first time the 53-year-old has spoken out since her husband, Sir Rod Stewart, publicly accused Wallace last month of being an \"ill-mannered bully\" who had \"humiliated\" his wife during her 2021 appearance on the show.",
      "Lancaster told ITV's Loose Women on Thursday: \"I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until it was out\".",
      "Wallace stepped down from MasterChef two weeks ago while an investigation into the allegations of historic misconduct are under way. His lawyers have strongly denied all the allegations.",
      "After the first claims emerged, Sir Rod posted on Instagram: \"Good riddance Wallace... You humiliated my wife when she was on the show, but you had that bit cut out didn't you?",
      "\"You're a tubby, bald-headed, ill-mannered bully. Karma got ya. Sir Rod Stewart\".",
      "Lancaster - who made it to the quarter-finals of Celebrity MasterChef - told Loose Women: \"Without going into details, I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until it was out and of course, you can imagine, the influx of inquiries there were.\"",
      "She said she was on jury duty at the time and didn't realise what had happened until later, saying she was \"in shock\" by Sir Rod's message.",
      "\"When I did turn my phone back on I got a message from a friend saying, 'Oh my God, how amazing was that message your husband put out!' And I was like 'What message? What has he done?'\"",
      "Speaking to the panel, Lancaster said: \"I most definitely was witness and victim to some of the bullying and harassment behaviour of Gregg Wallace, and unfortunately, a lot of those involved in the production team were also witness to that, and I really feel that he used his position of power to, I believe, intimidate and cause distress to a lot of people on set.",
      "\"And it's really unfortunate that someone like him is allowed to get away with that, and while others sort of stand by and let it happen at the same time.\"",
      "Lancaster added: \"I felt a little bit vindicated that something was put out there, going back to sort of that whole Me Too [movement], it's shocking to think how many women do suffer in the hands of... [men] in a powerful position and are too afraid to talk out.",
      "\"They don't feel at the time that they're going to be supported or listened to. So sometimes it can take a few years later for someone to mention something. It gives the other victims and people that have suffered the confidence to come forward.\"",
      "Wallace stepped aside from presenting MasterChef after a BBC News investigation last month discovered 13 people, spanning a range of ages across five different programmes, had made allegations against Wallace of inappropriate sexual comments.",
      "Other women have since come forward with further claims against the 60-year-old.",
      "Wallace's lawyers have said it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Production company Banijay UK announced an \"immediate, external review to fully and impartially investigate\" and has said that Wallace was \"committed to fully cooperating throughout the process\".",
      "Asked about Lancaster's specific allegations, Banijay says it \"takes this matter incredibly seriously but while the external investigation is ongoing, we won't be commenting on individual allegations\".",
      "\"It is important to note, that MasterChef welfare processes are regularly adapted and strengthened and there are clear protocols to support both crew and contributors.",
      "\"These include multiple ways of reporting issues, including anonymously. HR contact details are promoted, and contributors are assigned a point of contact on set available to discuss any issues or concerns.\"",
      "A BBC spokesman has described the allegations into Wallace's conduct as \"concerning\", and said the corporation would be supporting MasterChef producer Banijay UK in its investigation.",
      "It also thanked those \"who had the courage to speak out\", adding it hopes that the independent investigation \"can be concluded rigorously and as swiftly as possible\" and would \"follow due process and ensure fairness to all involved.\"",
      "Lancaster met her rock-star husband, best known for hit songs 'Do You Think I'm Sexy' and 'Maggie May', in 1999 while he was on tour. The couple married in 2007 and have two sons, Alastair, 18 and Aiden, 13.",
      "In 2017, during a discussion about the #MeToo campaign on social media started by survivors of sexual harassment and assault, Lancaster revealed she had been sexually assaulted as a teenager by someone she had worked for.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles got into the festive spirit with an enthusiastically received visit to a Christmas market in Battersea Power Station in south-west London.",
      "A community choir was singing the carol We Three Kings as he arrived - and they had at least one real-life King there in person to listen.",
      "\"You must be frozen. You'll need a stiff drink,\" the King said to the singers, outside in the December drizzle.",
      "The King also met Apple chief Tim Cook at the computer firm's UK headquarters in the huge former power station building, before singer Raye gave them a seasonal serenade of \"Holy Night\".",
      "Much of the power station is now a glitzy mall and Christmas shoppers got more than they bargained for as the King appeared, walking past the window of Starbucks.",
      "There can be something wistful about even the most cheerful carols - and it's been a difficult year for the King, with his health problems.",
      "But he looked cheerful here, talking to some rather gobsmacked stallholders under the Christmas lights. He always seems energised by the crowds, joking and chatting.",
      "When he was being steered on to the next part of the trip, he still dived across for an impromptu meeting with shoppers, shaking hands and facing the wall of mobile phones.",
      "The trip to the power station seemed to recharge him.",
      "He was introduced to 90-year-old Rita Kelly, who had worked here in the 1950s when the turbines were pumping out power for the capital, and who said she was \"honoured\" to talk about her memories with the King.",
      "\"Working here was a very happy time,\" she said. Although she said the King seemed to know about her \"mischievous\" side, when as a youngster she'd misguidedly tried to go upside one of the huge chimneys.",
      "Not even Father Christmas would have risked that one.",
      "The King visited the Curated Makers Market and saw the stalls for small traders and craftspeople. It was founded by Megan Jones, who has been supported by the King's Trust, formerly known as the Prince's Trust.",
      "\"People tend to go to big shops, but here they can talk to people behind the brand,\" said Soophia Foroughi, who chatted to the King about her handmade jewellery, under her label Ava and Azar.",
      "Natasha Kutrovatz, who sells her own jewellery, was delighted by the King's interest in people making a living from handmade crafts. \"As a parent, it's a much more flexible way of working,\" she said.",
      "The 1930s power station once produced a fifth of London's electricity, including supplying landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.",
      "The link to Buckingham Palace had been discreetly labelled as \"Carnaby Street\" in the control room, in case anyone broke in and literally wanted to switch off the Palace lights, said a spokeswoman for the power station.",
      "With the crowds and cameras for the King's visit, it was probably louder inside the halls than when it was generating power.",
      "It's enough to shake Santa's workshop, although in a designer outlet like this, the resident Santa is living in a \"yurt\".",
      "This huge cathedral of the industrial age remains an impressive sight - and the King's mother, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, had come here in 1949 to see the power station operating.",
      "The power station, built with six million bricks, is now filled with shops and places to eat and drink and the King looked up inside this cavernous post-industrial landmark. He waved back to some rather taken-aback shoppers, looking down from the layers of walkways above.",
      "The boiler house is so big that St Paul's Cathedral could fit inside.",
      "The King is known to be interested in architecture and design - and this building, with its four chimneys looking like an upside down coffee table, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, also responsible for the classic red phone box and Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.",
      "There's a strong sense of design for another business based in the power station - the technology firm, Apple, which the King visited after the Christmas market.",
      "Some might see parallels between Apple computers and the monarchy - a bit expensive but with many dedicated fans who think it's worth it.",
      "The King went into the Apple headquarters to meet chief executive Mr Cook and was shown an example of the firm's artificial technology, which can turn a few squiggles into a fully-fledged illustration.",
      "The computer company has worked with the King's Trust to help provide young people with digital skills and the King unveiled a plaque.",
      "Cook praised the King's \"lifelong commitment to philanthropy and the betterment of humanity\".",
      "There's a message about changed times in how it's Apple that now occupies these old buildings. This power station once used a million tonnes of coal a year, dug up in coalfields in Wales and northern England. It is tech-firms like Apple and designer shops that now fill the huge halls.",
      "And given how much the King has been photographed by mobile phones, there can few people in the country who have seen as many iPhones close up.",
      "At the end of the visit, drawings by children at a nearby primary school were projected on to the giant chimneys, climbing up into the evening sky. As the King left there was more music, with a performance by singer-songwriter Raye.",
      "After all the Christmas trees and conversations, maybe it was time for his own stiff drink."

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 06:13:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "Ad\u00e8le Haenel, a French actor who has accused a filmmaker of sexually assaulting her when she was a child, shouted at him to \"shut up\" before storming out in the middle of his trial.",
      "Christophe Ruggia, 59, was speaking in his defence at the time, arguing he had merely tried to \"protect\" Haenel during the early days of her fame.",
      "A French prosecutor has requested two years of house arrest for Ruggia, 59, who Haenel has said assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 15 and he was in his late 30s.",
      "Ruggia has said the accusations of sexual molestation are \"pure lies\".",
      "He also accused Haenel of wanting to take revenge on him for not hiring her for any more roles after she starred in his 2002 film Les Diables (The Devils).",
      "Haenel has said she was controlled and manipulated by Ruggia when she was a child and that nobody protected her when she was \"asked to do things in the name of art\".",
      "She alleges that Ruggia started molesting her during the shoot, when she was 12.",
      "Haenel, who starred in the acclaimed 2019 film Portrait of a Lady on Fire, publicly quit the French film industry last year because of what she said was its \"general complacency\" towards sexual predators.",
      "In 2019, she gave a lengthy and emotional interview to French outlet Mediapart in which she detailed what she called the \"sexual harassment\" she suffered at Ruggia's hands.",
      "She said she had decided to speak out about her alleged abuse after watching the documentary Leaving Neverland, which explored the singer Michael Jackson's relationships with children.",
      "\"It made me see I had clung for too long to the version of Ruggia, that it had all been a story of love,\" she said, adding that it made her understand the mechanisms of \"control and fascination\".",
      "Haenel said that on set Ruggia would touch her constantly, kiss her on the cheek, put his hands on her hips and call her \"my darling\" and \"sweetie\", and that he progressively isolated her from her family, telling her parents not to come to the film set to avoid distracting her.",
      "Other actors and technicians on the set told Mediapart of the unhealthy atmosphere.",
      "A summary of the charges quoted by French media says Ruggia and Haenel continued to see each other every Saturday after the shooting of Les Diables wrapped up, \"under the guise of film lessons\" during which Ruggia would allegedly touch her sexually and put his hands in her underwear.",
      "Investigators said they had found notes on Ruggia's computer in which he wrote about 12-year-old Haenel's \"overflowing sensuality\".",
      "When she eventually cut off links with him, he kept writing her numerous letters, according to the charge sheet. She later plunged into a deep depression which lasted until she was 28, she said.",
      "\"When I was under his thumb I felt dirty and wanted to die,\" Haenel told investigators.",
      "Ruggia has admitted to having made \"errors\" in his conduct towards Haenel.",
      "\"I did not see that my adulation for her, and the hopes I placed in her, might - given her young age - come across at times as irksome. If this is what happened... I ask her pardon,\" he said in a statement in 2019.",
      "At the trial, prosecutor Camille Poch said she had \"no doubt\" the allegations were truthful and said Ruggia's defence was \"unlikely\". \"He made the choice to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a grown man to decide to act otherwise.\"",
      "Haenel was the first prominent French actor to accuse the French film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual assault.",
      "Since then, actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been accused of rape and is due to stand trial next year. Film directors Beno\u00eet Jacquot and Jacques Doillon have also been accused of rape and sexual offences by actress Judith Godr\u00e8che.",
      "Haenel's lawyers have requested \u20ac30,000 (\u00a324,800) in compensation for moral damages and \u20ac31,000 to cover the cost of her psychologists' fees.",

      "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year.",
      "A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child.",
      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",

      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",

      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",

It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",

      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 05:56:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Disproven health claims are accepted with little challenge by host on number one podcast, BBC investigation finds.",
    "story": [
      "Diary of a CEO host Steven Bartlett is amplifying harmful health misinformation on his number-one ranked podcast, a BBC investigation has found.",
      "Recent claims from guests - including that cancer can be treated by following a keto diet, rather than proven treatments - were allowed by the Dragons' Den star with little or no challenge. Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",
      "In an analysis of 15 health-related podcast episodes, BBC World Service found each contained an average of 14 harmful health claims that went against extensive scientific evidence.",
      "Flight Studio - the podcast production company owned by Mr Bartlett - said guests were offered \"freedom of expression\" and were \"thoroughly researched\".",
      "The podcast launched in 2017 focusing on entrepreneurship and business. It soared in popularity as figures such as influencer Molly Mae and Airbnb founder Brian Chesky shared their tips for success.",
      "But in the past 18 months, Mr Bartlett has concentrated more on health, with guests presented as leading experts in their fields. Their views receive little challenge.",
      "The interviews are also posted to Mr Bartlett's YouTube channel, which has seven million subscribers. Since this content shift last year, its monthly views have increased from nine million to 15 million.",
      "Mr Bartlett told The Times in April he expected his podcast to make \u00a320m this year, mainly from advertising.",
      "We looked at the 23 health-related episodes released between April and November this year, fact checking - with four medical experts - 15 which contained potentially harmful claims.",
      "The experts we spoke to were cancer research professor David Grimes, public confidence in healthcare professor Heidi Larson, NHS diabetes adviser Dr Partha Kar and surgeon Dr Liz O'Riordan.",
      "We recorded harmful claims as advice that, if followed, could lead to negative health outcomes.",
      "In that eight-month window, some guests billed as health experts shared accurate information, but most were spreading misleading claims. These included:",
      "Anti-vaccine conspiracies, stating that Covid was an engineered weapon",

      "Evidence-based medication is \"toxic\" for patients, downplaying the success of proven treatments",
      "Evidence-based medication is \"toxic\" for patients, downplaying the success of proven treatments",
      "Podcasters may claim they are sharing information, but they are actually sharing harmful misinformation, says Dr David Grimes from Trinity College Dublin.",
      "\"That's a very different and not empowering thing. It actually imperils all our health,\" he says.",
      "Podcasts in the UK are not regulated by the media regulator Ofcom - which sets rules on accuracy and impartiality. So Mr Bartlett is not breaking any broadcasting rules.",
      "In a July episode, Mr Bartlett spoke to Aseem Malhotra, a doctor who became known during the pandemic for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines.",
      "In the episode, Dr Malhotra says the \"Covid vaccine was a net negative for society\". Analysis by the World Health Organization shows that it saved many lives during the pandemic.",
      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",
      "In many of the podcast episodes, the guests claimed to know a simple solution to health issues which they believed mainstream institutions were hiding from the public. They often also advertised their products on the podcast.",
      "Cancer researcher Dr Thomas Seyfried appeared on the podcast in October. He is a proponent of using the ketogenic diet, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat, to treat cancer.",
      "But Dr Grimes told us doctors warned patients against restricting their diet while undergoing cancer treatment.",
      "\"You could potentially and very realistically get very, very, sick and have a much worse health outcome than if you followed recommended advice from your oncologists,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast, Dr Seyfried also suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy only improved patients' lifespan by one-to-two months, comparing modern cancer treatments to \"medieval cures\".",
      "Mr Bartlett did not react to this claim.",
      "Cancer Research UK statistics show that UK cancer survival has doubled in the past 50 years. In the US, the cancer death rate has declined 33% since 1990, thanks to modern treatments.",
      "Dr Thomas Seyfried told us he \"stands by the statements that he made in the interview\".",

      "\"If I see someone tapping their fingers on a desk, my immediate thought is to chop their fingers off with a knife,\" an anonymous patient confides to a researcher.",
      "Another shares: \"When I see someone making really small repetitive movements, such as my husband bending his toes, I feel physically ill. I hold it back but I want to vomit.\"",
      "Sound familiar? If so, perhaps you too have a condition called misokinesia - a diagnosable hatred of fidgeting.",
      "Scientists are striving to understand more about the phenomenon that has no known cause, as yet.",
      "For the latest research, featured in the journal PLoS One, experts carried out indepth interviews with 21 people belonging to a misokinesia support group.",
      "Common triggers were leg, hand or foot movements - jiggling thighs, twitchy fingers and shuffling shoes.",
      "Pen clicking and hair twiddling were also triggers, though not quite as frequently.",
      "Often people reported some overlap with another more recognised condition called misophonia - an intense dislike of other people's noises, such as heavy breathing or loud eating.",
      "It's impossible to know exactly how many people might be experiencing misokinesia. One recent Canadian study suggested perhaps one in three of us might be adversely affected by other people fidgeting, experiencing intense feelings of rage, torture and disgust.",
      "I spoke with Dr Jane Gregory, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University in the UK, who has been studying and treating both misokinesia and misophonia.",
      "She told BBC News: \"The two go alongside each other very frequently. Often people have both at the same time.\"",
      "Although there is no good data, Dr Gregory says the conditions are probably suprisingly common.",
      "\"Obviously, people have been experiencing it for a long time but just didn't have a name for it.\"",
      "The severity of people's aversion to fidgeting varies, she tells me.",
      "\"Some people might get really annoyed by fidgeting or repetitive movements but it doesn't impact massively on day-to-day life,\" she says.",
      "Others, however, may \"get a really strong emotional reaction - anger, panic or distress - and just can't filter them out\".",
      "Through Dr Gregory's work, she tends to meet people with more extreme symptoms. Many are adults who have endured misokinesia for years, but some are in their early teens and experiencing it for the first time.",
      "'It just explodes inside you'",
      "Andrea, 62 and from the UK, says she developed misophonia and misokinesia at 13 but that it wasn't recognised at the time.",
      "One of her earliest memories of the condition is being distressed by a girl at school who was picking her nails.",
      "\"Most of misokinesia tends to focus around people's hands - what they are doing with their hands and what they are touching,\" she says.",
      "Another trigger for her is when people partially cover their mouth with their hand while speaking - she struggles to watch and feels like her own mouth is becoming sore when she does.",
      "Andrea says the anger she experiences is explosive and instantaneous.",
      "\"There's no thought process in it. There's no rationale. It just explodes inside you, which is why it is so distressing.\"",
      "She tells me she has tried different strategies to manage her condition, but can't block it out.",
      "Now she shields herself from society, living alone and working from home, and says her whole life is designed around avoiding the things that could distress her.",
      "Andrea says she has lots of supportive friends who understand that she sometimes needs to modify how she interacts with them.",
      "\"It's easier to just withdraw. To try and survive it. You can't keep asking other people not to do things.\"",
      "She explains that she doesn't blame people for their fidgeting and understands that most people's actions are unintentional and done out of habit.",
      "Andrea says sharing her experiences with a Facebook support group has been a real help.",

      "\"The other day, I was on the bus and there was a lady walking by and both her arms were swinging. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I was getting really anxious with it, not angry.",
      "\"It's silly things like someone is making me a cup of tea and they get the teabag and bounce it up and down, up and down, up and down. Why?",
      "\"Or if someone is sat there wobbling their leg. I can't take my eyes off it. Or if I do look away, I have to look back to see if they are still doing it.\"",
      "She tells the BBC the unpleasant feeling afterwards can eat away at her for hours.",
      "\"I'm not an angry person. It just makes me feel like there is a ball in my stomach that wants to explode. It's not anger, it's feeling really anxious inside.\"",
      "Julie says she is not afraid to ask people to stop doing something that she is finding distressing, but tends to walk away instead.",
      "Her misokinesia makes her unhappy, she tells me.",

      "Dr Gregory says the condition can be extremely debilitating and prevent people from focusing and doing normal things.",
      "\"Part of their brain is constantly thinking about this movement,\" she explains.",
      "\"Violent images might pop into their head. They want to grab the person and force them to stop... even though they are not angry in their normal lives.\"",
      "In terms of why some people are triggered, Dr Gregory says it might be a heightened basic survival instinct - like a meerkat on the lookout for danger.",
      "She likens the feeling to seeing \"someone scurrying in the distance\" or \"tuning into footsteps behind you\".",
      "\"For some people, you don't tune it out again. Your brain is continually monitoring.\"",
      "In noisy, hectic modern life, it's not very useful, she says.",
      "And if you keep getting triggered, the frustration and anger can build.",
      "For some people, it's strangers' habits that are most irksome, while for others, it's loved ones.",
      "One common way people try to manage the condition is by avoiding looking at fidgeting or by distracting themselves, Dr Gregory says.",
      "Others may try to avoid people entirely, as much as they can.",
      "If there is only one isolated visual trigger - such as hair twirling - the expert says it is sometimes possible to use reframing therapy to help the person view the situation in a more positive way.",
      "\"You might look at it deliberately and create a new backstory for why someone is doing that movement.\"",
      "That can help reduce the anger and anxiety, she says.",
      "\"A lot of people feel really embarrased or ashamed that they get such strong reactions,\" Dr Gregory adds.",
      "\"That, itself, can be a problem because suppressing your emotions can intensify them and make them worse.\""

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "1,200 tilers",
      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",

      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",

      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",
      "\"People were being sentenced, convicted, tried, all within a speedy time,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that's the way we deter crime best - by early detection, early prosecution and early resolution.\"",
      "Sir Brian's report will land on ministers' desks around the same time as a parallel review of sentencing of offenders.",

      "Matthew Pennycook hit back at Conservative claims the government was \"concreting over\" green belt land.",
      "He told MPs new housing targets for local councils were focused on parts of the country where housing was least affordable - and it was \"wrong\" to say rural areas would bear the brunt of the changes.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made increasing housebuilding a key priority, promising 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "\"Our plan for change will put builders not blockers first, overhaul the broken planning system and put roofs over the heads of working families and drive the growth that will put more money in people's pockets,\" said the PM.",
      "However, councils, including some Labour-run authorities, have previously raised concerns higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve.",
      "They point to strains on local infrastructure, land shortages and a lack of capacity in the construction industry as among the constraints on housebuilding.",
      "The government has said councils must meet their housing targets and that, if they refuse to put a local plan in place to do this, ministers will intervene and in extreme cases could take over plans themselves.",
      "Housing campaigners have welcomed the policy, saying it is vital for addressing the shortage of homes.",

      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building on green belt land, which is higher quality, will be allowed if other options have been exhausted - but it must comply with a set of \"golden rules,\" the government said.",
      "Developers will need to prioritise necessary infrastructure, such as nurseries and GP surgeries, as well as guarantee affordable housing and access to green spaces.",
      "It is still not clear what will count as grey belt land.",
      "The government has previously given disused petrol stations and car parks as examples.",
      "It gave some further explanation in the document, such as land that does not preserve the character of historic towns - but councils will have to wait until the new year for full guidance.",
      "Pennycook said the government had listened to feedback from councils who wanted housing to be better targeted at areas where affordability pressures were most acute.",
      "London, the south-east and east of England now have higher housing targets than those proposed by the government in July, while the targets for other regions are lower.",
      "However, Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"This planning framework pushes development to rural areas, concreting over green belt, green fields and over our green and pleasant land, rather than focusing on supporting building in urban areas, where we need to build the most.\"",
      "He added that it was \"vital\" homes were built in the right places with the right infrastructure and the government would \"bulldoze through the concerns of local communities\".",
      "Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said there was a danger the environment could suffer from plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be \"a colossal, historic missed opportunity\" to build new homes \"in a way that destroys nature, rather than at the same time, restores and rebuilds our natural infrastructure\".",
      "Overall, councils are being told they must reach a combined target of 370,000 new homes a year \u2013 although the government has not set a date for when this will be achieved.",
      "There is an expectation that not all the homes planned for by this target will be delivered within five years.",
      "The government has also promised \u00a3100m of extra funds for councils and 300 additional planning officers to speed up decision-making processes.",
      "It said local authorities would have 12 weeks to come up with timetables for new housebuilding plans or risk intervention from ministers.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said tackling local housing challenges would require a \"collaborative approach\" between councils and the government.",
      "Councils and communities who know their local areas well are \"best placed to make judgement decisions on how to manage competing demand for land,\" LGA spokesman Adam Hug said."

      "Could the bill be defeated?",
      "Some of those opposed to the bill say they have hired former government special advisors to try and \"professionalise\" their campaign, believing they were too disorganised at the last vote.",
      "They believe there are enough MPs who supported the bill initially, but could be persuaded to change their minds.",
      "But supporters point out the majority of 55 in favour at the last vote was more than they expected and meant they were confident the bill would pass its remaining stages in Parliament."

    "summary": "A new DNA analysis has shown that the arrival of modern humans from Africa was far from smooth.",
    "story": [
      "Far from triumphantly breezing out of Africa, modern humans went extinct many times before going on to populate the world, new studies have revealed.",
      "The new DNA research has also shed new light on the role our Neanderthal cousins played in our success.",
      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

      "The Allosaurus and Stegosaurus fossils represent two of the most recognisable dinosaurs from the Late Jurassic era, approximately 150 million years ago.",
      "The Allosaurus, often seen as a precursor to the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex), was a paramount predator in its day, notable for its sharp claws and a powerful bite.",
      "Meanwhile, the Stegosaurus is seen an iconic herbivore, whose armoured plates and spiked tail helped it to defend itself against predators and adapt to a challenging environment.",

    "summary": "Read the winning essay from the Young Science Writer of the Year 2024 award",
    "story": [
      "In her award-winning essay, young British science writer Jasmin Notarangelo carried out a very personal investigation into  a pressing global health issue that affects her family directly.",
      "Jasmin\u2019s essay, about managing Type 1 diabetes, won the 2024 Young Science Writer of the Year award. Here is an edited version of that essay.",
      "I am a teenager whose mother and grandmother both have type 1 diabetes.",
      "It is a disease which cannot be cured, only managed - an autoimmune condition, meaning that the body\u2019s defence system attacks cells in the pancreas. These cells are then damaged and cannot produce insulin - the hormone which helps keep blood sugar levels within a safe range.",
      "In people without diabetes, insulin is released when we eat, preventing our blood sugar levels from going too high. That does not  happen to diabetics. Without treatment, their blood sugar can spike - dangerously. Glucose monitors, healthy dietary choices, scheduled exercise, and most importantly insulin injections, are all used to control it.",
      "Insulin injections can be painful. They can cause bruising and a build-up of scar tissue, fat, and protein, which is called lipohypertrophy. As I have seen, these injections can be upsetting and restricting. Diabetics have to have their insulin with them and, for those who have problems with their eyesight, or with their mobility, it can be a struggle to inject.",
      "This is why I believe there is a better, more efficient way to deliver insulin.",
      "Your chocolate bar - my family's struggle",
      "Friendly fungi help forests fight climate change",
      "The insulin pump is a small device - around the size of a deck of cards - which supplies a continuous flow of longer-acting insulin through a cannula underneath the skin. This device comes in two forms, tubed and tubeless. Tubed pumps last for multiple years, with the insulin supply getting replaced every two to three days.",
      "Tubeless pumps are worn once and a new pump is applied every two to three days. They are changed often to stop the insulin supply running out and to prevent infection.",
      "An advantage of the insulin pump is that it allows increased flexibility for people with unpredictable schedules or who require smaller doses of insulin. This means that people with changing work shifts, who don\u2019t necessarily eat and exercise at set times each day can still have set doses of insulin.",
      "A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2011 says that 86% of survey respondents cited that the insulin pump fits in with their lifestyle much better than injections.",
      "It is also more convenient to change an insulin supply or pump every two or three days, than it is to inject, on average, four times a day.",
      "However, there are disadvantages with pumps, as they are not for everyone. It may be difficult for people with eyesight or mobility problems to change their pump, but this issue is also related to insulin injections. Cannulas can also bend, restricting the flow of insulin, and the pump can sometimes become disconnected from the tubing without the user noticing.",
      "The NHS only offers insulin pumps to those who experience frequent episodes of dangerously low or high blood sugar without warning. These are known as \u201chypos\u201d or \u201chypers\u201d. This means that many people choose to self-fund an insulin pump, which typically costs \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000. On top of that, the cost of the equipment needed costs just over \u00a31,000 per year. That is not affordable for many diabetics.",
      "Dr Iain MacLeod., who works as a GP at Prestonpans Group Practice in Scotland told me that insulin pumps had been \u201clife-changing for many patients\u201d.",
      "\u201cI think [they] have been an excellent addition to the range of options available for managing diabetes,\u201d he said.",
      "Dr MacLeod also expressed that pumps  \u201callow more flexibility\u201d, but that they \u201dare a lot more expensive than standard insulin therapy so, in these times of huge financial pressures within the NHS, it is probably not realistic for all diabetic patients to get the more expensive treatment options.",
      "\u201cIf the pump is the best option for a patient, then I would gladly recommend it,\u201d he added.",
      "Insulin pumps are becoming more accessible - and even more fashionable -  with companies selling accessories and pouches to protect pumps. I think this is making it easier to live with and accept the reality of the device, which is often life-changing.",
      "I believe it is important for diabetics to have access to whatever treatment options they need to not just manage their condition, but thrive.",
      "Jasmin is from Musselburgh Grammar School, East Lothian and the judges called her essay an \u201coutstanding piece that presented a compelling message about the accessibility of healthcare\".",
      "Runners up were Anna Joby, for her essay on light pollution and Lissie Marsh for a piece on the unseen environmental consequences of the overuse of tyres.",

      "It's the first time that scientists have witnessed clumps of stars assembling to form a galaxy like our own Milky Way and holds clues as to how the Universe was formed.",
      "Scientists have named the distant galaxy Firefly Sparkle, because it also looks like a swarm of multi-coloured fireflies.",
      "From its orbit in space unhindered by Earth's atmosphere, the most powerful telescope ever built has already shown us more distant and therefore older galaxies, but not one like our own in the early stages of forming and not in such detail.",
      "\u201cThe data of what happened at this stage of the Universe is very sparse,\u201d according to Dr Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts, who co-led the research.",
      "\u201cBut here, we are actually watching a galaxy as it is being formed brick by brick. The galaxies we normally see around us are already formed so this is the first time we have seen this process,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "Prof Heymans, Scotland\u2019s Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team, described the discovery as \u201cgorgeous, scientifically important and extremely festive\u201d.",
      "\u201cI find it amazing that humans have built a telescope that allows us to peer so far back in time and that we can see these very nascent phases of the galaxy in such a beautifully festive way.\u201d",
      "The star clusters are of different colours because they are at different stages in their formation, according to Dr Mowla.",
      "\u201cIt is so beautiful because the early life of a galaxy is extremely active,\" she said.",
      "\"There is so much happening, there are new stars being born, there are massive stars dying, there is a lot of gas and dust around it and there is nitrogen and oxygen and because of the state they are in, you have these lovely colours.",
      "\u201cWe are able to tell something about the ages of each cluster, the composition of their elements and the temperatures at which they formed.\u201d",
      "When Dr Mowla came across the galaxy, she had never seen clumps of stars in such vivid and varying colours. It led her to believe that there was something different about this system, so she checked how far away it was.",
      "To her surprise it turned out to be more than 13 billion light years away.",
      "The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence.",
      "There was a cluster of galaxies exactly between Firefly Sparkle and the JWST, which distorted spacetime to stretch the light from the faraway galaxy and effectively act as a gigantic magnifying glass.",
      "Astronomers call this process gravitational lensing, which in this instance enabled the research co-lead Dr Kartheik Iyer of Columbia University in New York, and other members of the team, to see for the first time, incredible details of how the first galaxies like our own Milky Way formed.",
      "\u201cIt takes the light coming from the firefly and bends it and amplifies it so we can see it in glorious detail,\u201d he told BBC News.",
      "\"Our reconstruction shows that clumps of actively forming stars are surrounded by diffuse light from other stars. This galaxy is literally in the process of assembling.\"",
      "\"When it does all this and we are able to see this incredible faraway galaxy, it is a very humbling, magical feeling.\u201d",

      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",

      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",

      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:14:31 GMT",
    "summary": "In the years before the mass rape trial that has shocked France, Gis\u00e8le almost caught Dominique Pelicot.",
    "story": [
      "It was November 2011, and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was sleeping too much.",
      "She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.",
      "Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed.",
      "Despite this, Gis\u00e8le, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lanc\u00f4me, their French bulldog, on long walks.",
      "She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gis\u00e8le would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s \u2013 but they had made it through.",
      "Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\"",
      "By that point, Gis\u00e8le and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box.",
      "He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as \u2013 in his own daughter's words \u2013 \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\".",
      "But in 2011, when Gis\u00e8le felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out.",
      "She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material \u2013 often extreme or illegal \u2013 was freely available.",
      "In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\"",
      "Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gis\u00e8le.",
      "At first he hesitated \u2013 but not for long.",
      "Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles.",
      "He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake.",
      "Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation.",
      "He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later.",
      "On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife.",
      "He would film them too.",
      "He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat.",
      "As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death.",
      "Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them.",
      "\"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gis\u00e8le was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\"",
      "Police station visit changed everything",
      "Sometimes, Gis\u00e8le came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\"",
      "Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts.",
      "Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gis\u00e8le was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission \u2013 drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied.",
      "Gis\u00e8le only felt better when she was away from Mazan \u2013 an oddity she barely noticed.",
      "It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.",
      "She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\".",
      "She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help.",
      "He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said.",
      "But Dominique must have known the end was near.",
      "Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others.",
      "\"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Bosse Plati\u00e8re, the director of the investigation, told the court.",
      "\"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague St\u00e9phane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\"",
      "His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology.",
      "They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless.",
      "Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Plati\u00e8re said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\"",
      "On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" \u2013  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes.",
      "\"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.",
      "At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.",
      "When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\".",
      "She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened.",
      "Recalling that moment, Gis\u00e8le said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her.",
      "'You cannot imagine the unimaginable'",
      "David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gis\u00e8le's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\".",
      "He and Gis\u00e8le wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024.",
      "By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gis\u00e8le's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "\"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\"",
      "Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" \u2013 pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gis\u00e8le as they didn't realise she was unconscious.",
      "\"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gis\u00e8le turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\"",
      "Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gis\u00e8le was clearly traumatised but calm and distant \u2013 a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks.",
      "Gis\u00e8le herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.",
      "Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gis\u00e8le \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\"",
      "Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised.",
      "Gis\u00e8le has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique.",
      "She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired.",
      "In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand.",
      "A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gis\u00e8le was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening?",
      "Pierre shook his head.",

      "South Korean lawmakers have voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed attempt to impose martial law, which sparked massive protests across the country.",
      "He was suspended after some members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP) voted with the opposition - though the decision still needs be ratified by the constitutional court.",
      "Thousands of anti-Yoon protesters celebrated outside the National Assembly on Saturday evening after the impeachment motion passed, with the crowd singing as fireworks broke out overhead.",

      "The South Korean president's martial law gamble backfired: What was he thinking?",
      "'Are we about to repeat history?': Martial law's traumatic legacy in South Korea",
      "\"I will take your criticism, praise, and support to the heart and do my best for the country until the end,\" Yoon added.",
      "His defiant words are a marked change from his apologetic tone earlier this month over his short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "Yoon attempted to impose military rule after months of political deadlock, saying it was necessary to block supposed North Korean efforts to undermine his government - but the declaration was overturned after a matter of hours by MPs.",
      "There has been strong public support for Yoon's impeachment, with recent polls finding three-quarters of South Koreans wanted to see him go.",
      "Following days of public pressure the PPP had decided to let its lawmakers vote on the motion, after an effort to impeach Yoon last week failed when its lawmakers boycotted the hearing.",
      "On Saturday, the impeachment motion reached the two thirds threshold needed to pass after 12 members of Yoon's party voted in favour.",

      "The success of the vote had depended on the support from the PPP, as the opposition lawmakers who tabled the motion needed just eight more to join them. Last Saturday, when the opposition first tried to impeach Yoon, they fell short by just a few votes as the PPP staged a walkout.",
      "On Saturday, the party held a marathon meeting that began at 10am and lasted till just minutes before the voting session began, as PPP lawmakers struggled to reach a consensus on the party's stance.",

      "Hours later he reversed the order after 190 MPs voted it down, with many of them climbing fences and breaking barricades to get into the voting chamber.",
      "Yoon later apologised but on Thursday he defended his actions, saying he had sought to protect the country's democracy and vowed to \"fight on until the end\".",

      "Before Assad took office in 2000, his late father Hafez was president for three decades.",
      "Now, with rebels led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir-al Sham (HTS) forming a transitional government, the future of the deposed president, his wife and their three children is uncertain.",
      "They are now in Russia, where they have been offered asylum, but what lies ahead for them?",
      "Why did Assad flee to Russia?",
      "Russia was a staunch ally of Assad during Syria's civil war and has two key military bases in the Middle Eastern country.",
      "In 2015, Russia launched an air campaign in support of Assad that turned the tide of the war in the government's favour.",

      "Hours after rebel forces seized control of Damascus, it was reported by Russian state media that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow and that they would be granted asylum on \"humanitarian grounds\".",
      "But when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about Assad's whereabouts and asylum claim by reporters on Monday, he said: \"I have nothing to tell you... right now. Of course, such a decision [on granting asylum] cannot be made without the head of state. It is his decision.\"",
      "The Assads' ties to Russia, specifically Moscow, are well-documented.",

      "Assad and his wife have three children: Hafez, the PhD student, Zein and Karim.",
      "A 2022 US State Department report to Congress said the extended Assad family's net worth was between $1bn (\u00a3790m) and $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) - though it noted that it was difficult to estimate because their assets are \"believed to be spread out and concealed in numerous accounts, real estate portfolios, corporations, and offshore tax havens\".",
      "According to the report, Bashar and Asma maintained \"close patronage relationships with Syria's largest economic players, using their companies to launder money from illicit activities and funnel funds to the regime\".",
      "It also said that Asma had \"influence over the economic committee that manages Syria's ongoing economic crisis\" - and had made key decisions on Syria's \"food and fuel subsidies, trade and currency issues\".",
      "She also exerted influence over the Syria Trust for Development, through which most foreign aid for reconstruction in regime-held areas was channelled.",

      "Could Assad face prosecution?",
      "Following the fall of the Assad dynasty, Amnesty International's secretary general Agn\u00e8s Callamard said Syrians had been subjected to what she called \"a horrifying catalogue of human rights violations that caused untold human suffering on a vast scale\".",
      "This includes \"attacks with chemical weapons, barrel bombs, and other war crimes, as well as murder, torture, enforced disappearance and extermination that amount to crimes against humanity\".",
      "She called on the international community to ensure that people suspected of breaking international law and other serious human rights violations must be investigated and prosecuted for their crimes.",

      "He is the fifth medic to kill themselves in Kenya in the last two months because of \"work-stress hardships and lack of responsive insurance cover\", according to Dr Davji Atellah, the secretary of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) - adding it was not something the union had ever recorded before.",

      "\"The thought that you could have done something to save a patient's life but you couldn't, can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and helplessness, contributing to mental health issues,\" Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda, a psychiatrist, told Kenya's Standard newspaper.",
      "Trainee doctors told the BBC that most medical schools do not adequately address the topic of suicide, leaving new and fatigued physicians poorly equipped to deal with traumatic ordeals - and this is compounded by poor pay.",
      "\"A healthy doctor builds a healthy nation. When I am stressed or depressed as a doctor, I might even forget how to perform resuscitation on a patient, which could lead to loss of life,\" said one intern doctor.",

      "About 1,400 Kenyans die by suicide each year, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. But some analysts believe that the actual numbers might be higher.",
      "Suicide remains criminalised in Kenya, where those found guilty of attempted suicide can face up to two years imprisonment, a fine, or both.",

      "The other two members of the alliance have stayed on the border, in Shan State.",

      "It marked the peak to date of his career,  his greatest moment in a long string of achievements.",
      "Gukesh became a grandmaster aged 12 years and seven months and even then, he was upfront about the fact that he dreamt of being the world champion.",
      "In fact, he said he had harboured such ambitions since he was seven when he was a spectator at a World Title match between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen in 2013.",

      "Gukesh is obviously an extraordinary talent but this is not the romantic story of a lone ranger surprising the world. The Chennai GM is at the apex of a robust chess ecosystem, which is one of the best, perhaps the best, in the world.",
      "Gukesh has also been strongly supported by his parents, by the chess establishment in India, and by his school.",

      "Indian teams have succeeded recently, winning both the Open Gold (with Gukesh on top board) and the Women's gold at the last Olympiad in Budapest.",
      "Those grandmasters are at the tip of a pyramid with over 30,000 rated players, because a huge number of Indians play officially sanctioned tournaments.",

But then I got interested in the game and I happened to enrol in a chess summer camp in my school\u2026 there one of the coaches spotted I had good talent for that,\" Gukesh told the BBC.",
      "Chess becomes an expensive game when a child has to travel abroad for several months of every year, so his parents not only put their own earnings into supporting their son, they also asked friends to help crowd-fund Gukesh's career until it took off.",

      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "Dola Posh has multiple identities: Photographer; woman; Nigerian; mother; Briton.",
      "Yet after giving birth, she no longer felt sure who she was.",
      "Six days after her daughter was born, she was lying in a bed in an English hospital, in the midst of a covid lockdown.",
      "She worried about how her life had changed and if she would ever again do what she loved - taking pictures.",
      "Unable to visit, relatives kept on calling to check up on her and the baby. After a difficult pregnancy, Dola felt under pressure.",
      "Her mother was thousands of miles away in the place she had left two years earlier \u2013 Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city.",
      "All this put her \u201cbrain in a very dark place\u2026 I thought: \u2018I\u2019m me; the baby\u2019s out, I\u2019m still me.\u2019 But no, I wasn\u2019t me any more.\u201d",
      "The loss of identity can be one of the causes of postnatal depression, which disproportionately affects black women. Though she did not recognise it at the time, this was what Dola was suffering from.",
      "Once out of hospital, she was almost immediately being bombarded with unsolicited advice.",
      "There was \u201ctoo much talk, too much control around how I should raise the child. In a way that also affected my mind. It made me feel like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I wasn\u2019t given the chance to be a mother.\u201d",
      "There is a matter-of-factness to the way the 33-year-old speaks about the events of 2020. She resists the tears this time, but she has cried \u2013 a lot.",
      "One night, worn down from feeling like a zombie, because of a lack of sleep, and the isolation and mundanity of her new existence, a voice in her head told her to take her own life.",
      "Emotionally unmoored, she clung on to her blanket as if it was a life jacket. Her baby girl \u2013 Monioluwa, meaning \u201cI have God\u201d in Yoruba \u2013 was by her side. She sang songs from home.",
      "She then made a middle-of-the-night call to her health visitor who, fortunately, picked up and agreed to come round.",
      "\u201cI buried my head in shame, I just felt so much shame because it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even a good mother. I don\u2019t have the strength to be a mother.\u201d",
      "Dola was persuaded to see a therapist, who encouraged her to use her camera as a way of dealing with her feelings.",
      "Learning the craft in Nigeria, while studying for a marine biology degree, she stood out from the crowd with her dyed-gold hair and pink boots.",
      "Dola began to build a reputation in Lagos\u2019s male-dominated worlds of fashion and celebrity photography. But she gravitated towards portraiture as it allowed her to document people\u2019s lives and encouraged subjects to share something more profound.",
      "For the therapy she turned the lens on herself \u2013 and, using an app on her phone to remotely control the camera, began to produce a portfolio of shots of her with Monioluwa.",
      "The mother-and-baby portrait, drawing on representations of the Madonna and child, is one of the fundamental motifs of the Western art tradition.",
      "Dola\u2019s photographs fit into this mode but the connection was unconscious at first and it took a mentor to point it out.",
      "She was raised in a religious household - her father was a bishop in a Nigerian church. Paintings of Mary and Jesus were on the walls of her home, and the image of the mother and child was in the Bibles and hymn books.",
      "\u201cThe colours: the green, red and gold; the gold frames and the light glow \u2013 growing up in that environment, it was all there in my subconscious.\u201d",
      "This all then came out in the way that she composed and lit her portraits.",
      "\u201cSometimes you do things, you don\u2019t even know why you do them and then when you sit down and reflect it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh!\u2019\u201d",
      "The veil, or head covering, that had been part of her church-going uniform, also became an essential element of her work.",
      "\u201cWhen I put on the veil, it didn\u2019t feel like that empty person any more. It felt more me\u2026 I was reconnecting with my family, it felt like I had their essence with me.\u201d",
      "The project was beginning to help Dola better understand her emotions.",
      "She says that when she started sharing her story \u201cthat motherhood was not all joys and I suffered from postnatal depression, that opened a door for me not to have shame any more.",
      "\u201cNow I am starting to work on the stories of what actually happened and the darkness, how I crawled out of it, and try to depict that through images.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Dola won an award from camera manufacturer Leica to allow her to continue her series and encourage more women \u2013 particularly black women - to break the stigma around postnatal depression.",
      "\u201cI want a world where black mothers don\u2019t have to carry so much burden and feel like they have to go through that journey alone and I want them to look in the media and see a reflection of themselves trying to make things work.\u201d",
      "In the UK, black women are more likely to experience postnatal depression than others, the Mental Health Foundation charity says. The reasons are complex, but Dola believes that being more open is vital in addressing the issue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s new for a woman to stand there and say: \u2018I almost ended my life, I\u2019m not ashamed of it \u2013 I am still an artist, I am still a woman and I have something to say.\u2019\u201d",

      "Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was \"deeply sorry\" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.",
      "But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to \"never purchase anything or voice support again\".",
      "'Performative and spineless'",
      "Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.",
      "Djerf Avenue's website promotes a world \"filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,\" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.",
      "Sumi told the BBC: \"It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.\"",
      "Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (\u00a327.5m) in revenue last year.",
      "It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened.",
      "'Betrayal of values'",
      "Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.",

      "It was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said Talia Jane, a journalist who was there.",
      "But it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 December, fuelled by latent anger directed at America's private health insurers.",
      "\"There was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,\" Ms Jane said.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 11:55:18 GMT",
    "summary": "It is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor, writes Hugh Schofield.",
    "story": [
      "President Macron has turned to a fellow centrist, and one of France's most experienced politicians, to extricate the country from its crisis of government.",
      "But if Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou commands plenty of respect across the political spectrum, it is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor Michel Barnier.",
      "Appointed by the president as the constitution dictates, the prime minister can nonetheless only function with the support of parliament.",
      "And as the National Assembly is crippled by the same three-bloc impasse as it has been since July - with no possible change before July 2025 - it would be a rash punter who predicted for Bayrou any degree of success.",
      "Since the fall of Barnier a week ago - after a vote of no confidence supported by left and populist right - Macron has consulted with a range of leaders in the hope of forming a new informal coalition to run the country.",
      "Barnier having been a man of the traditional right, Macron's first instinct was to turn to the traditional left - and efforts initially focused on prising the Socialist Party (PS) from its alliance with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).",
      "However as the PS's condition was the adoption of leftwing policies that Macron was unwilling to sanction,  he was forced to limit his search to his own inner circle.",
      "Bayrou has been a close ally of the president since before Macron's first stunning election win in 2017. Indeed Bayrou's decision to stand aside as a candidate that year - and rally behind the younger man - created a vital dynamic behind Macron's campaign.",
      "A well-known figure on the political stage for more than 40 years,  Bayrou - who is 73 - has run the Modem party, which now has 36 deputies, since its formation in 2007. Before that he was the leader of other centrist incarnations.",
      "His beginnings were in the Chistian Democrat tradition of post-war politics, which in general supported but kept a distance from the larger Gaullist component of the French right, led from the late 1970s by Jacques Chirac.",
      "Bayrou, who was a teacher of classical languages in his 20s, served as education minister from 1993 to 1997. But that was his last meaningful experience of government.",
      "Very briefly in 2017 he was Macron's justice minister, but stepped down after being accused in a party funding scandal.",
      "He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but many of his colleagues were convicted. And prosecutors have appealed against his acquittal, meaning he could yet be brought back to court.",
      "An observant Catholic with six children, Bayrou's political base is in the Pyrenean city of Pau where he has been mayor since 2014. He speaks the local Bearnese language and is a strong believer in decentralisation.",
      "Bayrou has run for the presidency three times, as standard-bearer of the centre. He was closest to victory in 2007, when he came third with nearly 19% of the vote. He then angered the future winner Nicolas Sarkozy by coming out in support of the Socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal.",
      "When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides.",
      "His backing for Royal and then Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012 has established a certain trust among the Socialists. But his views on debt - and the need to bring it down - help him on the right.",
      "Interestingly his relationship with Marine Le Pen of the populist right is also respectful. In the past he has helped her collect the sponsorships needed to run for the presidency, arguing that it would be an affront to democracy if the leader of the most popular party could not stand.",
      "Similar sentiments led to support for Le Pen, when the prosecutor in her own party funding trial (a similar case to his own) recently demanded she be declared ineligible for public office.",
      "This may mean that Bayrou can avoid an automatic censure from the populist right.",
      "But Le Pen's National Rally has also warned that if the new prime minister is \"Barnier with another face\" it will not hesitate to bring him down.",
      "According to France's veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel, Bayrou is an independent-minded and highly experienced figure who - though allied to Macron - will not hesitate to exert his power at Hotel Matignon, his official residence.",
      "\"He will not be easily disciplined,\" said Duhamel. \"And he will tilt policy more towards the left.\"",
      "France's crisis of government - the most serious in the Fifth Republic - has led to a major shift in power, away from the Elys\u00e9e and towards the prime minister and parliament.",
      "\"The last time we had a situation like this was the (post-war) Fourth Republic when presidents had very little power,\" said constitutional expert Christophe Boutin.",
      "\"Today again, power rests with the groups in parliament who may or may not come together on certain shared policies.\"",
      "Bayrou's first task will be to name a new government, which could take many days. The composition will be an indication of whether he has managed to build bridges to the Socialists on one side, and Barnier's conservatives on the other.",
      "But very quickly he will have to draw up a new 2025 budget to replace the one abandoned by the Barnier government; and immediately he will be faced with possible rebellions from the left and far-right.",
      "The idea of some parliamentarians of a kind of non-aggression pact - in which government promises not to push through laws without a vote and MPs promise not to vote a motion of censure - has been backed by Macron, who also said he did not want to dissolve the Assembly again before the end of his term in 2027.",
      "But critics say such a deal would be a licence for inertia, with no possible agreement likely on such important issues as bringing down the country's spiralling debt.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 06:07:31 GMT",
    "summary": "India's top court is hearing petitions against a1991 law that protects the character of religious places.",
    "story": [
      "India's top court is hearing a number of petitions challenging a decades-old law that preserves the character and identity of religious places as they existed at the time of the country's independence in 1947.",
      "The law, introduced in 1991, prohibits converting or altering the character of any place of worship and prevents courts from entertaining disputes over its status, with the exception of the Babri Masjid case, which was explicitly exempted.",
      "The Babri Masjid, a 16th-Century mosque, was at the heart of a long-standing dispute, culminating in its demolition by a Hindu mob in 1992. A court verdict in 2019 awarded the site to Hindus for the construction of a temple, reigniting debates over India's religious and secular fault lines.",
      "The current petitions, including one from a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), argue that the 1991 law infringes on religious freedom and constitutional secularism.",
      "The hearing comes against the backdrop of Hindu groups filing cases to challenge the status of many mosques, claiming they were built over demolished Hindu temples.",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "Many, including opposition leaders and Muslim groups, have defended the law, saying it is crucial to safeguard the places of worship of religious minorities in a Hindu-majority India. They also question the nature of historical evidence presented by the petitioners in support of their claims.",
      "They say that if the law is struck down or diluted, it could open the floodgates for a slew of similar challenges and inflame religious tensions, especially between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court barred courts from registering fresh cases challenging the ownership of places of worship or ordering surveys to establish their character and identity until further notice. It is next set to hear the issue in February.",
      "Why was the law introduced?",
      "The law says that the religious character of any place of worship - temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras - must be maintained as it was on 15 August 1947, when Indian became independent.",
      "The Place of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 was brought in by the then-Congress party government while a movement - led by members of the Hindu nationalist BJP - to build a temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in the northern town of Ayodhya was getting stronger. The aggressive campaign triggered riots in several parts of the country and, according to some estimates, left hundreds dead.",
      "The violence was a painful reminder of the religious strife India had witnessed during partition in 1947.",
      "While introducing the bill in parliament, then home minister SB Chavan expressed anxiety about \"an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests\".",
      "These groups, he said, were resorting to \"forcible conversion\" of places of worship in an attempt to create new disputes.",
      "The BJP, then in the opposition, strongly opposed the bill, with some lawmakers walking out of parliament. An MP from the party said he believed the bill was brought in to appease the minorities and would only increase the rift between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "Apart from archaeological sites - whether religious or not - the only exception to the law was the Babri Masjid, as a legal challenge against the structure existed even before independence.",
      "Hindu mobs, however, demolished the mosque within months of the enactment of the law. In 2019, while awarding the disputed land to Hindu groups, India's Supreme Court said that the demolition of the mosque was an illegal act.",
      "Why does it keep making news?",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling on the law will be crucial to the fate of dozens of religious structures, especially those of Muslims, that are contested by Hindu groups. These include Gyanvapi and Shahi Eidgah, two disputed mosques in the holy cities of Varanasi and Mathura.",
      "Critics also point out that the historical nature of the sites will make it hard to conclusively establish divergent claims, leaving scope for bitter inter-religious battles and violence.",
      "While the hearing is being closely watched, the law also makes news whenever there is a fresh development in cases challenging mosques.",
      "Two weeks ago, a court in Rajasthan issued notices to the government after admitting a petition claiming that the revered Ajmer Sharif dargah - a 13th-Century Sufi shrine that attracts thousands of visitors every day - stood over a Hindu temple.",
      "And last month, four people were killed in Sambhal town in Uttar Pradesh state when violence broke out during a court-ordered survey of a 16th-Century mosque. Muslim groups have contested the survey in the Supreme Court.",
      "There have been tensions over other court-ordered surveys earlier, including in the case of the Gyanvapi mosque. Hindu groups said the 17th-Century mosque was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the partial ruins of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Muslim groups opposed the survey ordered by a local court, saying it violated the 1991 law.",
      "But in 2022, a Supreme Court bench headed by then chief justice DY Chandrachud did not stop the survey from going ahead. He also observed that the 1991 law did not prevent investigations into the status of a place of worship as of 15 August 1947, as long as it did not seek to alter it.",
      "Many have criticised this since then, with former civil servant Harsh Mander saying that it \"opened the floodgates for this series of orders by courts that run contrary to the 1991 law\".",
      "\"If you allow the survey of a mosque to determine if a temple lay below it, but then prohibit actions to restore a temple at that site, this is a surefire recipe for fostering resentment, hate and fear that could detonate for years in bitter feuds between people of diverse faiths,\" Mr Mander wrote.",
      "Thursday's Supreme Court order means that these surveys and ongoing court cases remain on hold for now.",

      "In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.",

    "title": "More jobs and no 'nuisance taxes' - Ghanaians' great expectations",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:19:46 GMT",
    "summary": "John Mahama was elected on his pledges to solve the economic crisis but won't find it easy, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana's former President John Mahama will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters following his landslide victory in Saturday's election.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",
      "\"Our best days are not behind us; our best days are ahead of us. Forward ever - backwards never.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist. Now that has come to an end.",
      "Bashar al-Assad became president after the death in 2000 of his father Hafez, who had ruled for almost three decades.",
      "In 2011, he brutally crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than half a million people have been killed and 12 million others have been forced to flee their homes.",
      "Thirteen days ago, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a major offensive in north-western Syria.",
      "The rebels quickly captured the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, then swept southwards down the highway to the capital, Damascus, as the military collapsed.",
      "Russia announced that Assad had stepped down and left Syria on Sunday, hours after the rebels entered Damascus and crowds gathered on the streets to celebrate. It later emerged that Assad had flown to Moscow and been granted asylum.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",
      "After three days, they took control of most of Aleppo - Syria's second-largest city. They said they faced little resistance on the ground after the government rapidly withdrew its troops and security forces.",

      "End of Assad rule will reshape region's balance of power",
      "The Turkish-backed rebel factions meanwhile capitalised on the government's retreat by launching a separate offensive on territory north of Aleppo controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance supported by the United States, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).",
      "Assad vowed to \"crush\" the rebels with the help of his allies. Russian warplanes intensified strikes on rebel-held areas and Iran-backed militias sent reinforcements to help the military near Hama - the next city south on the way to Damascus.",
      "But Hama fell to the rebels on Thursday, after several days of fierce battles that eventually prompted the military to withdraw.",
      "The rebels declared their next goal was to take Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and achieved that on Saturday night after only a day of fighting. At the same time, other rebel factions reached the suburbs of Damascus.",
      "Early on Sunday, HTS-led rebels announced they had entered Damascus and released detainees at the country's most notorious military prison, Saydnaya.",
      "Less than two hours later, they declared: \"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled.\"",
      "The rebels also promised to build a \"homeland for all, including all sects and social classes\".",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 910 people had been killed, including 138 civilians, since the start of the rebel offensive.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "The Islamist militant group that led the offensive against Assad was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front.",
      "Al-Nusra Front, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year, was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly groups fighting President Assad.",
      "But it was feared for its jihadist ideology, and was seen as being at odds with the largely secular main rebel coalition - the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later.",
      "However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front. The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",
      "But it came at a time when the government had been weakened by years of war, sanctions and corruption - with allies Russia and Iran preoccupied by other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed group Hezbollah had recently suffered from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes had eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria, and Russia was distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad's forces were left exposed.",
      "What happens next?",
      "Outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalili said on Monday that most members of his former cabinet were working with the rebels \"so that the transitional period is quick and smooth\".",
      "The rebels said in a brief statement that their forces were close to establishing complete control of Damascus and preserving public property. They also said Syria's new government would begin its work as soon as it was formed.",
      "The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which represents now-former opposition groups, said on Sunday that it was committed to \"completing the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with full executive powers, paving the way for a free, democratic and pluralistic Syria\".",
      "The statement made no mention of HTS, but its vice-president, Dima Moussa, told the BBC that the \"transition requires coming together of all Syrian people, including those who are carrying arms\".",
      "Meanwhile, the war continued in other parts of Syria.",
      "HTS and its allies said their forces were advancing in the western countryside of Deir al-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army were also advancing north-west of Aleppo into territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Israel confirmed it was attacking suspected government chemical weapon and missile sites in Syria, saying this was to stop them falling into the hands of extremists. It also said it would keep a \"limited\" troop presence in what had been a demilitarised buffer zone in part of the Golan Heights because Syrian troops had abandoned their posts there.",
      "Former Assad loyalists also appeared to be still in control of the Mediterranean coast and mountains in the west of the country. The region is a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect and also the location of two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.",
      "How have world and regional powers reacted?",
      "Russian media said Bashar al-Assad and his family had been granted asylum. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had been as \"surprised\" as everyone else by what had happened and that Syria was \"going through a very difficult period now, due to instability\".",
      "Iran expressed a hope for \"the swift end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist actions, and the commencement of national dialogue\" with all parts of Syrian society.",
      "Turkey said Syria was now at a stage \"where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country\". Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the new government \"must be established in an orderly manner\" and warned that \"the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised\".",
      "US President Joe Biden said the collapse of the Assad government was a \"fundamental act of justice\" after decades of repression, but cautioned that the takeover by Islamist rebels created a moment of \"risk and uncertainty\".",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the collapse of the Assad government was the \"direct result\" of his country's action against Hezbollah and Iran.",
      "Iraq, where powerful Iran-backed militias sent fighters to support the Syrian military in the civil war, said it supported efforts to open a dialogue in Syria \"leading to the adoption of a pluralistic constitution that preserves the human and civil rights of Syrians\".",

    "summary": "The HTS chief has evolved from jihadist leader to rebel statesman while fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

      "According to a law enforcement bulletin seen by US media, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.",
      "He had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.",
      "He was arrested on Monday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.",
      "Mr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.",
      "Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder.",

    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

      "Investigators say the black pistol allegedly recovered from Luigi Mangione, the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a healthcare executive, appeared to be a ghost gun - a firearm that can be assembled at home.",

      "Here's what to know about these firearms.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "Ghost guns are so-called because they are potentially untraceable. They can be assembled at home, either from scratch or through weapon parts kits, and they are not marked with serial numbers.",
      "The weapon allegedly carried by Mr Mangione in his backpack seems to have been typical. The arrest warrant described it as a \"semi-automatic pistol with what appears to be a 3D-printed loaded receiver with a metal slide and silencer\".",
      "Police said it was capable of firing 9mm rounds, and was consistent with the type of weapon used in the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson in New York the week before.",
      "The Biden administration, arguing in favour of regulating the firearms, has previously described ghost guns as being \"ridiculously easy\" to put together.",

      "According to figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported as being found by law enforcement in criminal investigations in 2022 - a tenfold increase from 2016.",

      "A former government official doubted whether people's minds would be changed by Mr Thompson's killing. \"Ghost guns are a new factor in a very complicated and violent country,\" Juliette Kayyem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "America was finding it \"very hard\" to restrict the firearm, said Ms Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "More than 48,000 people were killed by firearms generally in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Are ghost guns regulated?",
      "The killing has renewed scrutiny of ghost guns - which the Biden government has tried to regulate by saying they should be treated in the same way as commercially available firearms.",
      "Manufacturers of ghost gun kits are now required to include serial numbers on their products, and perform background checks on the purchasers.",
      "In October, the US Supreme Court signalled its willingness to uphold the law, which has been challenged by gun rights groups saying that authorities had overstepped the bounds of pre-existing legislation.",
      "A ruling that upholds the ATF's new regulation would mark a change for this Supreme Court, which has a conservative super-majority that has been largely sceptical of gun regulations.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:16:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Cuba's hotels, already hit by power cuts, are now worried about Donald Trump's re-election.",
    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 17:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Tech leaders and companies are shelling out big bucks to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, as they prepare for the next four years of a Trump White House.",
      "Amazon, run by billionaire Jeff Bezos, intends to donate $1 million to the president-elect's inaugural fund and will stream the ceremony on Prime, amounting to another $1 million in-kind donation, according to a source familiar with the donations. The Wall Street Journal first reported Amazon's plans.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also plans to send $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump's inaugural fund, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. Fox News Digital first reported Altman's intended donation.",
      "\"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX, has become a regular presence by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago, and spent $277 million to help get Trump elected.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Reddit, as well as major corporations who have donated to inaugural funds in the past, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, for information about their plans.",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

    "story": [
      "A House-passed bill that would expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans just got a lifeline in the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Chuck Schumer said Thursday he would start the process for a final vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, which would eliminate two federal policies that keep a portion of Americans from getting their full Social Security benefits, including cops, fire fighters and teachers.",
      "One living-and-breathing example is Terry Hoover, a firefighter in Louisville, Kentucky, for more than 20 years. Now retired, he says these two provisions cost his family more than $1,000 a month.",
      "\"My Social Security is reduced due to my pension,\" Hoover, told fellow first responders at a rally earlier in the week, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by a local CBS affiliate. \"And then my wife, she was a nurse for 41 years and paid into the Social Security system, you know, and I cannot draw one penny off of her because of my pension.\"",
      "Schumer, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the legislation,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the bill would \"ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.\" As majority leader, he can invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "That's important, as the clock is ticking as to its fate, with only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Decades in the making, the bill would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said of the proposal, which the league supports. \"We're guardedly optimistic,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch earlier in the month.",
      "The bill had 62 cosponsors when the Senate version was introduced last year, and would now need at least 60 votes to pass Congress and then head to President Biden.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy took to the Senate floor to call for a vote in the chamber. \"If Schumer brings it up, it'll pass,\" said Cassidy, among its Republican sponsors.",
      "Will the Senate pass the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill next week. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Opposition includes the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact. In a statement responding to Schumer's announcement, the group's president, Maya MacGuineas, said it was \"truly astonishing\" that lawmakers would consider speeding up the trust fund's demise.",
      "The measure would increase the burden on Social Security's trust funds, which are already estimated to not be able to pay the full amount of scheduled benefits starting in 2035. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "\"The Senate should reject WEP and GPO repeal. Instead, they should come together to try to fix the issues with WEP and GPO as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen Social Security, prevent insolvency and make the program's finances sustainable over the long term,\" MacGuineas urged.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a vote of 327-75 last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 13:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the law firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research in New York City, has a sobering perspective.",
      "\"People who are in their 40s and 50s will do worse than their parents and their grandparents,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Ghilarducci explains that those two previous generations could at least bank on government-sponsored retirement programs.",
      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",
      "With plenty of time to get back on her feet, Childs says that she has finally stopped worrying.",
      "\"Maybe working longer could be on the table,\" Childs said. She is also entertaining the possibility of working part time later in life.",

    "summary": "Fast-food worker who provided crucial police tip is eligible for up to $60,000, but getting it will take time.",
    "story": [
      "More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",

The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said.

      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",

This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",
      "\"We need to be ready to fight. This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\" he said to reporters, referencing Trump's inauguration date, \"and we don't know to what extent this fight is going to go.\"",
      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "In 2023, Ontario also directly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and is a major exporter of power to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Canada retaliated with its own duties on U.S products such as whiskey and yogurt coming from a plant in Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",

      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

    "summary": "The judge criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for Sandy Hook families.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights.",
      "After being named the winning bidder last month, The Onion CEO Bell Collins briefly described its plans for Infowars in a statement to social media.",
      "\"We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website. We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off. I can't wait to show you what we have cooked up,\" he wrote.",
      "The Onion said its \"exclusive launch advertiser\" would be the gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "In a satirical\u00a0article\u00a0posted to The Onion, the supposed CEO of Global Tetrahedron, the parent company of The Onion, said \"the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.\"",
      "\"Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic 'panic' and growing steadily ever since, InfoWars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses,\" fake Global Tetrahedron CEO Bryce P.

      "Trump was also expected to select Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta as ambassador to Italy, CBS News learned.",
      "Ferguson, who is already one of the FTC's five commissioners, will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior.",
      "\"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History.\"",
      "Fertitta, meanwhile, the billionaire CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc., is Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Italy, people familiar with the decision told CBS News Tuesday. Trump transition officials declined to comment.",
      "Fertitta is a friend of Trump's and longtime GOP donor who leads Landry's Inc., a Texas-based corporation with hotels, restaurants and casinos. He starred in a reality TV show on CNBC called \"Billion Dollar Buyer\" and owns more than 600 properties in 36 states and in over 15 countries, according the company's website, including the iconic Golden Nugget Casino, Morton's The Steakhouse, the Palm Restaurant and Joe's Crab Shack.",
      "Fertitta joined Trump and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u00a0for a Starship rocket launch\u00a0in Texas in November.",
      "Tom Barrack was chosen as the nominee for ambassador to Turkey. Barrack, a wealthy financier, met Trump in the 1980s while helping negotiate Trump's purchase of the renowned Plaza Hotel. He was charged with using his personal access to the former president to secretly promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates, but was acquitted of all counts at a federal trial in 2022.",
      "Trump called him a \"well-respected and experienced voice of reason.\"",
      "Johnson \u2014 not the Republican senator \u2014 served as ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration. His nomination comes as the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign and became engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her \"a close friend and ally\" and praised her \"sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.\" Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.",
      "\"I am so proud of Kimberly. She loves America and she always has wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador. She will be an amazing leader for America First,\" Don Jr. posted.",
      "The ambassador positions must be approved by the U.S. Senate.",
      "Guilfoyle said in a social media post that she was \"honored to accept President Trump's nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "Trump also announced Tuesday that he had selected Jacob Helberg as the next undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, and Dan Bishop as deputy director for budget at the Office of Budget and Management.",
      "The replacement of Khan at the FTC likely means that the commission will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection divisions.",
      "\"These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,\" wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland & Knight, in a recent analysis.",
      "Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command.",
      "For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.",
      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",

      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper that his client and his client's son were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James Murdoch said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that they welcome the ruling and hope that their family can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \"The effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch's favor after Rupert Murdoch's passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",
      "He added: \"The court, after considering the facts of this case in the light of the law, sees the cards for what they are and concludes this raw deal will not, over the signature of this probate commissioner, prevail.\"",

      "Navy defeated Army 31-13 on Saturday to take home the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy, CBS Sports reported.",
      "During the game, Trump sat in the box of Sen.-elect Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and former deputy national security adviser Dina Powell McCormick. He was joined by Vice President-elect JD Vance, embattled Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth\u00a0and others for the 125th matchup between service academies. Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump picked to be his director of national intelligence, was spotted in the box.",
      "Elon Musk,\u00a0the billionaire tapped to co-head the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency, was also seen with Trump.",
      "Also in attendance was\u00a0Daniel Penny, a military veteran who was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide this week in the chokehold death of an agitated subway rider in New York. Penny was invited by Vance, who accused prosecutors of trying to \"ruin\" Penny's life by charging the Marine veteran in the death of Jordan Neely in 2023.",
      "Gen. Charles \"CQ\" Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also shown sitting with Trump. The Joint Chiefs chairman is the nation's highest-ranking military officer, and serves as the primary military adviser to the president, defense secretary and National Security Council.",
      "Brown was nominated to the post by President Biden in May 2023.",
      "Trump, who attended Army-Navy games as president-elect in 2016 and during his first terms, has been making an increasing number of public appearances before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. He was accompanied by his family and Vance on Thursday as he rang the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized as Time magazine's person of the year.",
      "Trump spent the weeks after the Nov. 5 election holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida assembling a team to help lead his next administration. He and his aides have become bullish about Hegseth's chances of winning Senate confirmation. The Army combat veteran and former Fox News host's chances of becoming defense secretary had appeared in peril amid allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault and his views on women in combat.",
      "Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said Friday in a Newsmax interview that Hegseth has \"made it through the gauntlet.\" Miller predicted Hegseth will be confirmed.",
      "\"This is someone who's literally been shot at on the battlefield,\" Miller added. \"That's the type of person who I want leading the (Department of Defense) because as we make these decisions about whether or not to put American troops into harm's way, I want someone who knows at a personal level what that's like before you go and send some young man or young woman into battle.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., attended the game and brought with him a contingent of other GOP lawmakers vying for face time with the incoming president weeks before Republicans take control of the three branches of the federal government.",
      "Johnson said he intends to discuss with Trump plans for a legislative package that could move through Congress next year with a simple majority in the face of expected Democratic opposition.",
      "Vance said Friday that Penny, a fellow Marine veteran, had accepted his invitation to be in Trump's suite on the Army side. Penny was cleared of criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death after a judge had dismissed a more serious manslaughter charge last week because the jury deadlocked on that count.",
      "The case was a flashpoint in the long-standing debates over racial justice and as well as failures by New York City to address homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with.",
      "\"Daniel's a good guy, and New York's mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone,\" Vance said in a post on X. \"I'm grateful he accepted my invitation and hope he's able to have fun and appreciate how much his fellow citizens admire his courage.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mysterious drone sightings\u00a0in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and other East Coast states have prompted an outcry from officials seeking answers about the flying objects, some of which have been spotted near military installations.",
      "A federal official said Thursday that the FBI is the lead agency investigating the sightings. An FBI official told CBS News the agency has received several thousand tips. Local law enforcement are also investigating.",
      "Multiple sightings have been reported in parts of New Jersey, New York City, New York's suburban Rockland County, several counties in eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The NYPD said Thursday that multiple drones were seen flying over a neighborhood in the Bronx, but soon after officers responded to calls about the sightings, the drones disappeared.",
      "And on Friday night, drone activity\u00a0briefly shut down runways at Stewart International Airport in Orange County, New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed Saturday.",
      "What have authorities said about the drone sightings?",
      "In a letter to President Biden, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called for more resources to be directed toward understanding what's behind the increased activity involving drones, also known as unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS.",
      "\"The continued reporting of UAS activity has raised more questions than answers and prompted an outcropping of conspiracy theories across social media and other platforms,\" Murphy said in a Thursday letter that he posted to social media Friday. \"I respectfully urge you to continue to direct the federal agencies involved to work together until they uncover answers as to what is behind the UAS sightings.\"",
      "During a call-in program on Wednesday night, Murphy said he would be bringing up the issue with the White House on Thursday but assured constituents that the drones as of now don't appear to pose a safety threat.",
      "\"Based on everything we know,\" Murphy said, \"there is no public safety risk we're aware of. On the other hand, is it frustrating to not have more answers on this? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes.\"",
      "Hochul announced Saturday that the runways at Stewart Airfield, which is a part of Stewart International Airport, were shut down for about one hour due to drone activity. The airport, located about 60 miles north of New York City, services commercial and military flights.",
      "She called on Congress to \"pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act. This bill would reform legal authorities to counter-UAS and strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones, and would extend counter-UAS activities to select state and local law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "Hochul\u00a0said earlier Friday there was no evidence the drones posed a threat and that authorities were coordinating with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. The New York State Police said it's received numerous reports of drone sightings and posted on social media an email address where people can submit additional reports.",
      "White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that \"we have not been able to corroborate any of the reported visual sightings\" and that many of the drones are manned aircraft being operated lawfully.",
      "An FBI official earlier this week told Congress that the FBI has received over 3,000 tips from the public about these incursions, which are mostly occurring at night.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New Jersey Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim sent a letter to DHS, the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a briefing \"as soon as possible on how your agencies are working with federal and local law enforcement to identify and address the source of these incursions.\"",
      "Gillibrand told CBS News on Thursday, \"We need the FAA and the FBI and Homeland Security to get on this. If they need authorities to take these drones down, they should ask for them, but I think they can take them down now because they don't know who is manning them.\"",
      "Gillibrand said the drones can be taken down with traps or nets or disabled in other ways.",
      "\"There's ways you can do this without endangering a population,\" she said. \"At a minimum, you should be following these drones to see who's flying them and where they land, and then get them when they land.\"",
      "Kim posted a video of what he saw over a New Jersey park Thursday night.",
      "Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.\n\nWe oriented ourselves with a flight tracker app to help us distinguish from airplanes. We often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app. Some hovered while others moved across the horizon. We saw a few that looked like they were moving in small clusters of 2-4. We clearly saw several that would move horizontally and then immediately switch back in the opposite direction in maneuvers that plane can\u2019t do. \n\nThe police officer said they see them out every night. They only seem to start when it gets dark and they disappear before dawn. They get reports that they sometimes fly low over homes, especially up in the hills. The officer said they\u2019ve tried to get closer with use of a helicopter but that the drones would turn off the lights and go dark if approached.\n\nThe parking lot at the reservoir had a number of cars of people coming to take a look for themselves. Several shared with me their own stories of having seen some up close. One described them being the size of the hood of a car. I went to multiple locations across Hunterdon county to get different vantage points. This is a more rural part of NJ. It\u2019s uncertain why it\u2019s one of the more active area for reported activity. We are seeing reports through other parts of the state. Any images or video footage people get, the police urge them to submit to the FBI, but I haven\u2019t gotten any follow up yet from the FBI on their investigation and what they\u2019ve compiled. Homeland Security Secretary briefed last week on new technology they were deploying but we need details on what those efforts have yielded and if more resources are needed. If they haven\u2019t fully identified the devices yet we still should know what is being done.\n\nThis has gone on for weeks. It\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.\n\nI\u2019ll continue to track these developments and share as much as possible to the people of NJ that deserve more answers than they are getting.",
      "\"I'm just not getting the kind of communication and engagement when it comes to the investigation that's happening by the FBI, Homeland Security, so we need a lot more communication to the people of New Jersey to be able to understand what's happening,\" Kim told CBS News New York.",
      "And in a lengthy social media thread on Saturday, Kim claimed that \"with the help of civilian pilots and others able to do deeper analysis\" he \"concluded that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.\"",
      "Kim said this conclusion was based, in part, on flight tracking data.",
      "\"I share this because this is the kind of analysis we need but are not getting from the federal government to explain this situation,\" Kim wrote Saturday. \"FAA experts have much more experience/resources to identify aircraft. Instead I'm left to draw on civilian support and public apps.\"",
      "The FAA said Thursday that at the request of federal partners, it had published two temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.",
      "Where have the drones been spotted?",
      "The drones were first spotted near Morris County, in northern New Jersey, in mid-November. Since then, there have been reports of low-flying drones throughout the Garden State, and they have been reported over Staten Island, other areas of New York City, northwest of the city in Rockland County, and several counties in Pennsylvania as well.",
      "Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he \"personally witnessed (and videoed) what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence in Davidsonville, Maryland (25 miles from our nation's capital). I observed the activity for approximately 45 minutes,\" beginning at about 9:45 p.m. Thursday night.",

I observed the activity for approximately 45 minutes. Like\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Ipx8ctLmhs",
      "Hogan expressed frustration at the response from the federal government, calling it \"entirely unacceptable.\" He also said that, \"like many who have observed these drones,\" he didn't know if they posed a threat to public safety or national security.",
      "\"But the public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government,\" Hogan said. \"The government has the ability to track these from their point of origin but has mounted a negligent response. People are rightfully clamoring for answers, but aren't getting any.\"",

      "\"The resident could not hear the drones, but stated they were very bright, and she observed these for over an hour,\" Harwich Police Chief Kevin Considine said in a news release.",
      "Where are the drones coming from?",
      "\"Our initial assessment is that this is not the work of a foreign adversary or a foreign entity,\" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Wednesday.",
      "After assessing that the drones are not a threat to military installations, the Pentagon is leaving it up to local law enforcement and the FBI to investigate the origins and type of drones.",
      "Singh said the drones were not U.S. military drones, and she refuted an idea presented by Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey that there was an Iranian \"mothership\" off the East Coast of the United States launching the drones.",
      "Why not shoot them down?",
      "Some lawmakers have called for shooting down the drones to analyze them, but others have voiced concern over falling debris endangering highly populated areas.",
      "Singh, the Pentagon deputy press secretary, said base commanders have the authority to shoot them down if they pose a threat to military installations, but so far, there hasn't been a threat.",
      "U.S. Northern Command, which oversees protecting the territory of the United States, said in a statement that it has not received requests from local law enforcement to assist.",
      "\"We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle, and we refer you to those installations for information on any efforts they are may be conducting to ensure the safety and security of their personnel and operations,\" the statement said.",
      "Is this a one-of-a-kind incident?",
      "This drone mystery comes on the heels of others in the past year or so.",
      "One of the most notable cases was in December 2023, Langley Air Force Base in Virginia reported multiple drone incursions throughout that December. In a statement at the time, the base said that the number of drones fluctuated and they ranged in size and configuration.",
      "The head of U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, Gen. Gregory Guillot told Congress earlier this year during testimony that, \"Drones are certainly an increasing threat.

      "\"While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,\" spokesperson Ian Krager said in a statement. \"Speaker Emerita Pelosi is currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the matter say Pelosi injured her left leg in a fall. Krager declined to specify the nature or severity of the injury but said Pelosi continues to work from the hospital and \"looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.\" The news outlet RTL Luxembourg earlier reported that she had been taken to Kirchberg Hospital in the northeast of Luxembourg City.",
      "Pelosi, 84, served as Democratic leader in the House for 20 years, including two stints as speaker, before stepping aside two years ago.

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 21:32:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Aaron Siri, an attorney to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., petitioned the FDA to \"withdraw or suspend\" its approval of a polio vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, denounced efforts \"to undermine public confidence in proven cures\" like the polio vaccine.",
      "\"The polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease. Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they're dangerous,\" McConnell said.",
      "McConnell credited the \"miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love\" with saving him from paralysis when he contracted the disease at two years of age, and he praised\u00a0 the \"miracle\" of \"the saving power of the polio vaccine\" for the millions of children who came after him.",
      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",
      "The CDC says IPOL is \"mainly used as a travel vaccine for adults.\" The agency says that the \"body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports\" the safety of polio vaccines.",
      "Siri has hinted at plans for more petitions to the FDA, after Kennedy is in charge at HHS.",
      "\"It will help if there are outsiders, from the outside attacking in. For example, the FDA acts on petitions. If you want to license a product, you have to petition them. If you want a product to be withdrawn or reevaluated, you typically often have to petition them,\" Siri told Del Bigtree, ICAN's founder and a former campaign spokesperson for Kennedy, on his podcast last month.",
      "\"Somebody on the outside needs to be petitioning them,\" Siri added.",

      "Amazon, run by billionaire Jeff Bezos, intends to donate $1 million to the president-elect's inaugural fund and will stream the ceremony on Prime, amounting to another $1 million in-kind donation, according to a source familiar with the donations. The Wall Street Journal first reported Amazon's plans.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also plans to send $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump's inaugural fund, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. Fox News Digital first reported Altman's intended donation.",
      "\"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX, has become a regular presence by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago, and spent $277 million to help get Trump elected.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Reddit, as well as major corporations who have donated to inaugural funds in the past, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, for information about their plans.",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",

    "summary": "Women have served in combat roles for the U.S. for more than 30 years, and some veterans and enlisted women worry Pete Hegseth might change that if he's confirmed as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Many veterans, service members and officials in the Defense Department worry that decades of progress could be unraveled in a matter of months if Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, is confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Army veterans who spoke to CBS News are concerned Hegseth would seek to reinstate a ban that would bar women from serving in ground-based combat units. Hegseth contends he wants tougher standards that both men and women would have to achieve and maintain, but he has written about and spoken extensively against the inclusion of women in ground-based direct combat roles.",
      "\"I would love for him [Hegseth] to look into the eyes of the loved ones of the women who were killed in action in Afghanistan and Iraq and tell them that they were not in combat or that their loved ones were not worthy of putting it all on the line or putting themselves in the line of fire to serve our country,\" said Allison Jaslow, a former Army captain and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the post-9/11 nonprofit veterans organization.",
      "After the Gulf War in the early 1990s, Republicans and Democrats in Congress recognized the role women played in the conflict by repealing an exclusionary statute from 1948 that barred women from positions where they potentially could be exposed to combat, and lawmakers did so over the objections of most senior military leaders and Pentagon officials at the time. The rescinded ban in 1993 opened the door for women to serve in air and naval combat units.",
      "Eleven years ago, the direct combat exclusion rule was lifted and by 2015, women began reporting to ground combat units, including infantry and special operations.",
      "Allowing women in combat roles has been widely embraced in the U.S. The majority of voters from both major political parties and independents supported the change and said it would not harm military effectiveness, the Pew Research Center found in 2013.",
      "Hegseth \u2014 an Army veteran-turned-Fox News host \u2014 and his defenders contend the criticism and concern expressed by Jaslow and others is baseless. Over the past few weeks, Hegseth and his lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, also a Navy veteran, have sought to clarify his position.",
      "\"Everybody is taking the initial click-bait headline of 'I'm straight-up saying no women in combat,' and they're just stopping there. [They] don't listen to the rest. What does he mean by that? It doesn't matter, we're offended by the broad sweeping statement, and you don't see there really is more nuance to it,\" Parlatore told CBS News by phone.",
      "Following Trump's announcement that Hegseth was his pick for defense secretary, a video clip of Hegseth on former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan's podcast lit a firestorm about the issue of women serving in combat roles.",
      "\"I'm straight-up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,\" said Hegseth on the podcast in early November. \"It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"",
      "He added, \"I'm not even talking about pilots\u2026I'm talking about the physical, labor intensive-type jobs \u2026 [Navy] SEALs, [Army] Rangers, [Army] Green Berets, you know, MARSOC [Marine Forces Special Operations Command], infantry battalions, armor, artillery \u2026 I'm talking something where strength is the differentiator.\"",
      "In his book, \"The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,\" published in June, Hegseth details myriad reasons he believes women should not serve in ground-based, direct combat roles in a chapter titled \"The (Deadly) Obsession with Women Warriors.\" Hegseth elaborated on his views of women in combat and suggested what his approach to the issue would be if he's confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"Dads push us to take risks,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units.\"",
      "Hegseth, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, contends that the integration of women into ground-based combat units that have historically been male-dominated, combined with \"our loss of a Christian ethos for God's creation,\" have incorrectly reduced men and women to a state of parity, despite the difference between the sexes in physical strength. Hegseth believes this integration is \"dangerous\" when it comes to direct combat roles.",
      "Moreover, Hegseth argues that training women to kill in war runs counter to a woman's \"core instincts\" of motherhood. Here's what he wrote about this idea:",
      "Women are life givers, regardless of what the abortion industry might want us to think. This role was embedded in human beings and was one of the clear reasons why the only, even mythologically articulated, successful women in combat narratives involve separatist societies of nonchildbearing women who live apart from men. To create a society of warrior women you must separate them first from men, and then from the natural purposes of their core instincts.",
      "He says allowing women to serve in combat roles subverts the norms of a civilized society where men are \"trained to treat women differently than we treat men.\"",
      "\"Women in combat forces men to ignore those civilized instincts. If you train a group of men to treat women equally on the battlefield then you will be hard pressed to ask them to treat women differently at home,\" Hegseth said in his book.",
      "Hegseth does not seem to object to women serving in the military in general or in supportive combat roles, such as those in the medical or aviation fields. At one point, he celebrated Army soldier Leigh Ann Hester, who received the Silver Star for her actions in Iraq, making her the first woman in the military to receive the third-highest award for combat valor since World War II. However, he also said another woman was awarded the Silver Star because of \"an agenda.\" Hegseth stressed that soldiers like Hester are outliers when it comes to ground combat.",
      "He proposes a single standard for a given job in the military that both men and women alike must achieve, with additional standards to maintain membership in specialty roles.",
      "In his book, Hegseth complained that the military has quietly made it easier for women to meet its standards, to the detriment of some branches. For instance, he mentioned the Army Airborne School's daily five-mile run, which had been a staple for its troops (though not a requirement) and once served to weed out weaker candidates. \"Too many women were washing out, so the run went away,\" he wrote.",
      "The Army dropped the five mile run from airborne school in 2018, according to Task & Purpose, a news website which covers the U.S. military and veteran community. An Army colonel told the news outlet, \"Analysis found the physical training requirements did not correlate with meeting any course learning objectives related to static line parachute operations such as safely donning a parachute, exiting a high-performance aircraft, controlling descent, or performing a parachute landing fall.\"",
      "Retired Army Command Sgt. Maj. Jeffrey Mellinger, who was interviewed for the article, said some service members believe making training less difficult equates to lowering standards. He noted that many soldiers had also protested years ago when the Army allowed soldiers to run in shoes, rather than boots. That change was made to stem running injuries.",
      "The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment before this report published, but in a speech at West Point in early December, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed the idea that women should not be in combat roles.",
      "\"So look, if I get a little fired up about this, it's just because this isn't 1950. It isn't 1948. It is 2024,\" Austin said, according to the Associated Press. \"And any military that turns away tough, talented patriots \u2014 women or men \u2014 is just making itself weaker and smaller. So enough already.\"",
      "An Army officer who spoke with CBS News said she didn't object to unisex standards, but she is concerned that Hegseth would work to eliminate equality of opportunity for women in the military who want to be in ground-based combat units.",
      "The Army officer, who's an artillery operator, spoke under the condition of anonymity because she's not authorized to speak publicly, due to Defense Department media regulations.",
      "\"I've thought more about getting out of the Army in the last three months than I ever have in my life, but honestly, they would have to force me out,\" the officer told CBS News. \"I'm an artilleryman or I'm not in the Army. \u2026 I wish we could just be in the Army and have a good time and do our job, but I keep having to defend my existence to people who don't care if I live or die. \u2026 But they're going to have to drag me out of the artillery field.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney maintains these fears are unfounded.",
      "\"None of Pete Hegseth's policies would prevent a Second Lieutenant Joni Ernst from being a combat veteran,\" Parlatore told CBS News, pointing to GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa as an example. He added, \"It's going to make it a bit more difficult for Second Lieutenant Joni Ernst to become a Green Beret because she's going to have to meet the unisex standard.\"",
      "Ernst served in Iraq and Kuwait and retired from the Iowa Army National Guard at the rank of lieutenant colonel after 23 years of service. On Tuesday, Ernst seemed to suggest she was more comfortable with Hegseth as a defense secretary nominee and said she looked forward to a fair hearing, and one that she said would not rely on anonymous sources.",
      "Ernst, who is the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate, also said in a statement: \"Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women \u2014 based on quality and standards, not quotas.\"",
      "Army Maj. Gen. Tammy Smith, who retired in 2021, told CBS News that Hegseth seems to be overly concerned with tactical issues over a strategic vision for the Defense Department.",
      "\"I find that [views on women in combat roles] to be a tactical viewpoint in a position that is supposed to have the greatest influence on our long term strategy,\" said Smith. \"I think his approach to some of these tactical issues doesn't convey a background in experience that is required to lead the largest organization in our government, and so it's my armchair quarterback assessment that he doesn't have the background, managerial or character skills in order to lead the institution that he's being nominated to lead.\"",
      "She added, \"It really disappoints me in the lack of seriousness that the president-elect is conveying by this particular selection to be our secretary of defense\u2026I know that there are people out there who meet all the conservative requirements that an administration gets to choose from when they win an election.\"",
      "For now, Hegseth continues to enjoy strong support from Trump and others, as he continues to meet with the GOP Senate lawmakers on Capitol Hill who will be critical to his confirmation prospects. Reports that Trump was considering potentially replacing Hegseth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis amid allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement of two veterans' groups seem to have subsided.",
      "More than 30 military veterans who are House Republicans signed a letter expressing their \"strong support\" for Hegseth, Fox News reported Wednesday.",

      "A Georgia judge has rejected former Trump campaign lawyer Kenneth Chesebro's push to invalidate his guilty plea in the Fulton County election interference case.",
      "Chesebro was one of 19 defendants charged in the August 2023 indictment accusing former President Trump and others of trying to illegally overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia.",
      "Chesebro pleaded guilty in October 2023 to a conspiracy to file false documents charge. He was sentenced under Georgia's First Offender Act, which allows the charge to drop off his record if he successfully completes probation with no violations.",
      "Earlier this month, Chesebro's attorney asked Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to throw out the plea after he dismissed the charge Chesebro pleaded guilty to. His attorneys argued the plea should be thrown out because it violates his rights to due process.",
      "But McAfee dismissed the motion calling it, \"procedurally defective in more ways than one.\" He noted that Chesebro \"has already submitted a plea in response to this indictment \u2014 one of guilt.\"",
      "He also said that Chesebro's motion was not a \"valid motion in arrest of judgment\" \u2014 Chesebro was calling on McAfee to stop the judgment because of a defect. McAfee pointed out that under the First Offender Act, Chesebro had pleaded guilty before \"an adjudication of guilt\" and \"without entering a judgment of guilt.\" So, McAfee reasoned in the ruling, \"No final judgment occurs \u2026.Therefore, there can be no arrest of judgment here.\"",
      "The indictment accused Chesbro of proposing, in a memo to Trump allies, \"a bold, controversial strategy\" to overturn the election: appoint alternate electors loyal to Trump in several states.",
      "This proposal and at least one other memo he penned were included in the Georgia indictment as overt acts \"in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The seven original counts against him stemmed from the plan to submit a slate of fake electors from Georgia.",

The appeals court is reviewing a trial judge's ruling that allowed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting the case if special prosecutor Nathan Wade resigned.

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 15:40:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court said it will wade into a case over whether California can set its own vehicle emissions standards under a scheme laid out in the Clean Air Act.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will wade into a case over whether California can set its own vehicle emissions standards under a scheme laid out in the Clean Air Act.",
      "The case involves a section of the law that preempts states from setting their own emissions standards for new vehicles. But the act exempts any state that had rules in place before March 1966, just after the law was amended to regulate automobile emissions, that are \"at least as protective of public health and welfare\" as the federal requirements.",
      "California was the only state that regulated vehicle emissions before 1966, and therefore is the only state eligible for a waiver. In order to obtain a waiver, California must show that it needs its own emission standards \"to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" The Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt California's vehicle emissions standards.",
      "Since the Clean Air Act was enacted, the EPA has granted California more than 75 waivers for its vehicle emissions program. In 1993, the agency granted a waiver for the state's zero emission vehicle standards. It did so again in 2019 for California's first set of greenhouse-gas emissions standards.",
      "In 2012, California put in place the Advanced Clean Car standards, which aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and other pollutants by increasing requirements for zero- and low-emission vehicle sales in the state for model years 2015 through 2025. The standards govern all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles.",
      "The EPA issued a waiver to California for those regulations in 2013, and car manufacturers started working to comply with the new emissions standards. But the agency revoked the waiver as to the zero-emissions and greenhouse gas requirements during the Trump administration in 2019. In 2022, under President Biden, it was reinstated again.",
      "The EPA said at the time that California is \"particularly impacted\" by climate change, citing\u00a0 wildfires, heat waves, floods and droughts. These climate change impacts are \"compelling and extraordinary conditions,\" the standard for a waiver under the Clean Air Act, the agency said.",
      "Several big automakers, including Volvo, Stellantis, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda, have all agreed to comply with California's more stringent vehicle standards.",
      "A group of 17 states, led by Ohio, and fuel companies asked the federal appeals court in Washington to review the EPA's reinstatement of the 2013 waiver. The states argued the waiver provision in the Clean Air Act violates the Constitution by treating California differently from the other states, while the fuel producers said they are harmed by California's requirements because they depress the demand for their product by requiring vehicle manufacturers to sell automobiles that use less or no liquid gas.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the EPA in April. As to the states, the court found that Congress has been granted the authority to regulate interstate commerce, including vehicle emissions, and it was the legislative body that laid out the Clean Air Act's preemption and waiver scheme. The three-judge panel also said the fuel producers did not have the legal right to sue.",
      "\"The nature and extent of equality between the states has been a central debate throughout our country's history, from the founding to the admission of new states and beyond,\" D.C. Circuit said in an unsigned opinion. \"But state petitioners point us to no meaningful support for their novel request to apply the equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\"",
      "Both the companies and the states appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the D.C. Circuit's decision is incompatible with the Constitution because Congress doesn't have the power to elevate a single state above the other 49.",
      "The Supreme Court said Friday it would review only whether fuel producers can point to the waiver's effect on automakers to show they have standing to sue. The justices declined to review whether the EPA's waiver for California is unlawful.",
      "California and the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to turn down the case and uphold the Clean Air Act's waiver provision.",
      "The dispute is one of several to land before the Supreme Court in recent years involving the Clean Air Act and efforts to tackle air pollution.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court blocked the agency's so-called \"good neighbor\" plan, which aims to curb air pollution and address harmful smog. Two years earlier, in the summer of 2022, the high court found Congress didn't grant the EPA the authority under the Clean Air Act to set emissions caps based on the generation-shifting approach taken through the Clean Power Plan rule.",
      "But in cases that have arrived before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, the justices have declined to intervene. In a trio of disputes, the high court temporarily allowed the EPA to continue enforcing more stringent standards on emissions from coal-fired power plants and new and existing oil and gas facilities.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 13:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the law firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

And a vast majority of them should not be in jail. A vast majority should not be in jail, and they've suffered gravely. And I say, why is it that in Portland and in many other places, Minneapolis, why is it that nothing happened with them and they actually caused death and destruction at levels not seen before? So you know, if you take a look at what happened in Seattle, you had people die, you had a lot of death, and nothing happened, and these people have been treated really, really badly.

In other words, if she would have gone out and just did interviews where they're comparable to Steve [Cheung, Trump's communications director], if there is anybody comparable, would say, could you do an interview here? An interview there? You know, she didn't do anything. And people said, Is there something wrong with her? Why would they? I mean, I'm doing this interview with you. I did interviews with, if I had the time, anybody that would ask, I'd do interviews. I think the Joe Rogan interview, you know, that went on for almost three and a half hours.",

They wouldn't do the basic. And people, including me, would start to say, is there something wrong with her? What's wrong? Why wouldn't you do some basic interviews?

I specifically didn't want to read it because it wasn't under my auspices, and I wanted to be able to say that, you know, the only way I can say I have nothing to do with it is if you don't read it. I don't want \u2014 I didn't want to read it. I read enough about it. They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don't like. I won't go into individual items, but I had nothing to do with Project 2025. Now, if we had a few people that were involved, they had hundreds of them. This is a big document, from what I understand.",

      "Time: Really?",
      "Trump: I let them know, yeah, I didn't think it was appropriate, because it's not me. Why would they do that? They complicated my election by doing it because people tried to tie me and I didn't agree with everything in there, and some things I vehemently disagreed with, and I thought it was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that prior to my election.",
      "Time: Did you express those frustrations with them?",
      "Trump: Oh I did. It wasn't a frustration, it was a fact. It's totally inappropriate. They come up with an 800-page document, and the enemy, which is, you know, the other party, is allowed to go through and pick out two items, 12 items out of, you know, 800. No, I thought it was an open \u2014 I thought it was a very foolish thing for them to do.",

President Trump is for you,\" the ad said.",
      "But in his interview with Time, Trump downplayed fights over transgender rights, particularly which bathroom transgender people are allowed to use, saying the issue has \"ripped apart our country\":",
      "Time: Can I shift to the transgender issue? Obviously, sort of a major issue during the campaign. In 2016, you said that transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose. Do you still feel that way?",
      "Trump: When was that?",
      "Time: In 2016.",
      "Trump: I don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees. I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with, but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.",
      "Time: But on that note, there's a big fight on this in Congress now. The incoming trans member from Delaware, Sarah McBride, says we should all be focused on more important issues. Do you agree?",

      "Trump on using military for deportations: \"I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows\"",
      "Turning to immigration, the Time journalists noted that federal law prohibits using the military as law enforcement on U.S. soil. They asked Trump how that squares with his promise to use the military to facilitate his mass deportation plans:",
      "Time: You recently said on Truth Social that you plan to use the military to deport migrants. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. What will you do if the military does not or refuses to carry out your orders?",
      "Trump: Well, it doesn't, it doesn't stop the military if it's an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country. We have criminals coming into our countries that we've never seen, we've never seen before. We have people coming in at levels and at record numbers that we've never seen before. And I'll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help. We'll also get National Guard. We'll get National Guard, and we'll go as far as I'm allowed to go, according to the laws of our country.",

      "Time: Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, yes, absolutely. But on Musk specifically, giving him the power to oversee the agencies that regulate his companies. Isn't that a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I don't think so. Look, we have a country that is bloated with rules, regulations and with, frankly, people that are unnecessary to do. We are going to need a lot of people in a lot of other jobs. We're looking to get people into private sector jobs where they can do better and be more productive. We're going to see what happens. We have some interesting months coming up, at the beginning. We're going to see what happens. But this country is bloated.",
      "Time: I think everybody agrees that there's waste in the federal government\u2014",
      "Trump: Waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Time: But Elon Musk is talking about cuts that would directly affect NASA, which would then directly affect SpaceX, his company. Isn't that the textbook definition of a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I think that Elon puts the country long before his company. I mean, he's in a lot of companies, but he really is, and I've seen it. He considers this to be his most important project, and he wanted to do it. And, you know, I think, I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company.",

      "Time: Right. Well, no, tell me.",
      "Trump: Well, I just said it. You can't reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion. And I disagree with the whole thing, because it should have never happened. Putin would have never invaded Ukraine if I were president for numerous reasons. Number one, they drove up the oil price. When they drove up the oil price, they made it a profit-making situation for him, the oil price should have been driven down. If it was driven down, you wouldn't have had it wouldn't have started just for pure economic reasons. But when it hits $80, $85, and $90 a barrel. I mean, he made, he made a lot of money. I'm not saying it's a good thing, because he's also suffered, but they are moving forward. You know, this is a war that's been \u2014 this is a tragedy.

I want, I don't want people killed, you know? I don't want people from either side killed, and that includes whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or whether it's the Palestinians and the Israelis and all of the, you know, the different entities that we have in the Middle East. There's so many different entities. But I don't want people killed.",
      "Time: When you say productive things are happening, can you be more specific?",
      "Trump: No, I can't. I mean, I'd love to be, I would so love to be, but I can't. I will be. We're going to sit down in a period of time, hopefully soon, and I'll tell you all the things that are happening. But there are some very productive things happening. I do think\u2014okay, because I'm looking at two, two primary fronts, right? You have the Russia-Ukraine, and you have this, and there are other problems also. But look, when North Korea gets involved, that's another element that's a very complicating factor. And I know Kim Jong Un, I get along very well with Kim Jong Un. I'm probably the only one he's ever really dealt with. When you think about it, I am the only one he's ever dealt with. But you have a lot of very bad complicating factors there, but we'll sit down and we'll at the end of each of these, or both, maybe simultaneously, we'll sit down and I'll show you what a good job I did.",
      "Time: You mentioned the Palestinian people. In your first term, your administration put forward the most comprehensive plan for a two-state solution in a long time. Do you still support that plan?",
      "Trump: I support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms. When I did the Abraham Accords, that should have been loaded up with people, you know. I made a statement. I think they didn't add one country. Think of it. They didn't add one country to the Abraham Accords. We had the four countries, very important countries, but that should have been loaded up with Middle Eastern countries.",
      "Time: Do you still support a two-state solution?",
      "Trump: I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.",

      "Possible origins of the number",
      "Republicans began making claims that more than 300,000 unaccompanied children had been \"lost\" after the Department of Homeland Security released a report in August which showed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, did not serve notices to appear in court to 291,000 children between fiscal year 2019 and\u00a0 May 2024.",
      "Additionally, 32,000 unaccompanied children failed to show up for immigration court dates from fiscal year 2019 to 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Two top Senate Democrats are calling for President-elect Donald Trump's potential appointees to be required to disclose any communications they had with Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser, after allegations recently surfaced that Epshteyn was soliciting financial payments in connection to their efforts to secure government appointments.",
      "\"All nominees appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee should immediately act to retain all communications with Mr. Epshteyn, provide those materials to the Committee well in advance of their hearing date, and be prepared to testify regarding any discussions with Mr. Epshteyn about receiving a potential appointment in the incoming administration,\" Democratic Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island wrote in a letter shared with CBS News and the conservative publication Just the News.",
      "The letter was addressed to Republican Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and also copied to Trump's transition team leader Susie Wiles. It asks that the senior Republicans require any Trump appointees who come before the Judiciary Committee for confirmation to \"preserve and produce to the Committee any communications with Mr. Epshteyn.\"",
      "The senators wrote that \"questions remain regarding whether any nominees made promises or other assurances to Mr. Epshteyn as a condition of his support.\"",
      "A transition source called the letter a \"pathetic Lawfare tactic.\"",
      "Epshteyn previously told CBS News he was honored to be working for President-elect Trump and that the allegations against him were patently false.",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "Graham's office said it would defer comment to Grassley, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Grassley said in a statement, \"Committee members will have the opportunity to ask nominees questions on these issues when they come before the Senate for a hearing.\"",
      "Late last month, the New York Times reported that attorney David Warrington, who will be Trump's incoming White House counsel, conducted a review into the allegations against Epshteyn and concluded that Epshteyn had solicited payment from at least two people. The Times reported that Warrington recommended that Trump keep his distance from Epshteyn.",
      "Last month, CBS News reported that Trump's transition team was grappling with internal strife over Epshteyn's conduct related to possible candidates for positions in the Trump administration. At least one Republican politician, former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, alleged in a sworn declaration to the transition team that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with the internal investigation being conducted by Warrington, who also served as general counsel to the Trump campaign.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue, as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung at the time. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 16:48:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The rule closes a loophole that exempted overdraft fees from lending laws, but is expected to face challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

    "story": [
      "A new report by the Justice Department inspector general found that the FBI failed to commission the dozens of FBI field offices across the country to gather information from its own confidential human sources ahead of the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, despite telling Congress that it had done so.",
      "Had the FBI's field office canvassed those sources, it \"could have helped the FBI and its law enforcement partners with their preparations in advance of January 6,\" the report said.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told investigators that not canvassing the nation for further information was the \"basic step that was missed.\"",
      "The inspector general determined the FBI's inaccurate reporting to Congress about the lack of field office coordination was not intentional.",
      "\"Our review of documented CHS reporting in FBI field offices as of January 6 did not identify any potentially critical intelligence related to a possible attack on the Capitol on January 6 that had not been provided to law enforcement stakeholders prior to January 6,\" the inspector general said.",
      "More than two dozen individuals utilized by the FBI as confidential human sources were in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, ahead of the Capitol breach, but none were authorized by their handlers to illegally enter the Capitol building or join the riot that day, the inspector general's report said.",
      "No undercover FBI agents or employees were found to have attended the Jan. 6 protests or taken part in the attack, the report said.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, revealed that federal investigators tasked just three of the 26 FBI sources in the city that day to gather information for domestic terrorism cases, and the remaining individuals were not directed to be there. In all, four confidential human sources entered the Capitol building during the riot and 11 were on restricted Capitol grounds.",
      "According to the Justice Department, confidential human sources are those \"believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI and whose identity, information, or relationship with the FBI warrants confidential handling.\" Federal investigators conventionally utilize these individuals to report on members of criminal organizations and provide information that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The use of confidential human sources around the time of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach has been a point of contention on Capitol Hill, and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray has faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the practice.",
      "In the days after the riot, questions surfaced about the intelligence gathered ahead of the attack and whether it was properly acted upon by federal investigators. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the FBI correctly identified a potential for violence as Congress was set to certify the results of Joe Biden's 2020 victory over Donald Trump and took appropriate steps in preparation. The U.S. Capitol Police \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 led law enforcement efforts to protect the Electoral College certification that day, while other agencies provided support.",
      "On the eve of the riot, the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued a raw intelligence report warning of an anonymous social media thread threatening violence at the Capitol, CBS News previously reported. But, according to Capitol Police officials, that information was never shared with their agency. The FBI has defended its handling of the intelligence.",
      "\"Many of these 26 confidential human sources had provided information relevant to the January 6 Electoral Certification before the event and\u2026a few CHSs also provided information about the riot as it occurred,\" Horowitz wrote. The report revealed some sources were in contact or traveling with members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, organizations whose leadership has since been convicted at trial of seditious conspiracy as a result of the attack.",
      "In response to the report, the FBI said it disagreed with \"certain factual assertions\u2026regarding the manner of specific steps, and the scope of the canvass undertaken by the FBI in advance of January 6, 2021.\"",
      "After the Capitol breach, the FBI launched one of the largest federal probes in American history, and prosecutors have since charged more than 1,500 defendants with crimes ranging from illegal entry into the Capitol building to assaulting police and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Nearly 1,000 of those charged have entered into plea deals with the Justice Department and admitted guilt. Another 200 have been convicted at trial before a judge or jury.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's report revealed that none of the FBI's confidential human sources who entered the Capitol or restricted grounds that day were among the hundreds criminally charged for doing so.",
      "In response to the report's findings, the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., which has spearheaded the Capitol breach investigation, said, \"The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office generally has not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals; and we have treated the CHSs consistent with this approach.\"",
      "Despite President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to issue pardons for some of the defendants, federal prosecutors have continued to charge individuals for alleged crimes tied to the Capitol attack in the weeks after the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Some defendants and their legal teams have pushed for early release from prison or a pause in their proceedings ahead of Trump's inauguration. Federal judges overseeing the cases have mostly denied those requests. Advocates on behalf of the defendants have urged Trump to issue pardons.",
      "\"I'm going to be acting very quickly,\" Trump said earlier this week in an interview with NBC News.

    "title": "Learning from the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:32:51 -0500",
    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",

      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

      "Vance said Friday that Penny, a fellow Marine veteran, had accepted his invitation to be in Trump's suite on the Army side. Penny was cleared of criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death after a judge had dismissed a more serious manslaughter charge last week because the jury deadlocked on that count.",
      "The case was a flashpoint in the long-standing debates over racial justice and as well as failures by New York City to address homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 07:07:48 -0500",
    "summary": "White Elephant gift exchanges are common during the holidays. Here's what to know about the rules of the exchange and how to play.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, many parties and gatherings might include a gift exchange. Along with Secret Santas and cookie swaps, guests might be invited to participate in a White Elephant gift exchange.",
      "White Elephants are a little different from other gift exchanges. Participants can steal gifts from other players, and more customized versions of the game can include cards and dice to really mix things up.",
      "Here's what to know about the rules of White Elephant and how to best play the game.",
      "What are the basic White Elephant rules?",
      "To start, anyone who wants to participate in a White Elephant has to bring a gift. Often, those gifts will be silly or impractical. Players will select from the gift pool in an assigned order: Guests can draw straws to see who will go when, or the host can set an order prior to the event. Anything works, as long as people know when they'll be up.",
      "When it's time for the game to begin, the first player will select a gift. For most variations of the game, it's important to make sure everyone knows what the player picked \u2014 this will be important later!",
      "When the second player goes, they'll have two options: They can open a new gift, or steal the previous player's gift. If a player gets a gift stolen from them, they then get to pick again before the game progresses to the next participant. The game will continue like that until every participant has a gift. After the last player has picked a gift, the first player will get the chance to steal, if they want.",
      "To keep the game moving, there are some limits on stealing. Usually, a present can only be stolen once per turn, so if the second participant steals a gift from the first, the first player can't take the gift back immediately. But if the first player gets their gift stolen a second time, they can then reclaim their gift from the second player. It's also common to automatically end the turn after three swaps, so the game doesn't grind to a halt.",
      "How can you customize White Elephant rules?",
      "White Elephant rules can be customized in a variety of ways. To start, you can remove limits on steals or swaps per turn, but be warned that this will likely slow down the game.",
      "Players can also take those limits even more seriously. In some versions of the game, if a gift is swapped three times, it's considered out of the game and cannot be stolen again, which means the person who is holding it after the third steal gets to keep it. In other versions, a player can be considered out of the game if they are stolen from three times. That means they can no longer be stolen from, and get to keep whatever gift they are holding at the time.",
      "White Elephant organizers could also set a theme for gifts, or keep them wrapped until after the game has ended to add an element of mystery.",
      "There are also ways to make White Elephants more complicated. White Elephant organizers could play the \"dice game\" variation, which incorporates a pair of die and a rules sheet created by the gift organizer. In this variation, players can select their playing order based on dice rolls. When the time for picking gifts starts, the first player will roll the dice, and then do whatever the corresponding item on the rules sheet is. Some versions don't allow players to unwrap their gifts until told to do so by the rules sheet. In those cases, the game can continue until all players have unwrapped their gifts.",
      "There's also a card game version with similar rules to the dice game. In this variation, players use cards to determine the order in which they'll play and which actions they'll take.",
      "Do you wrap a White Elephant gift?",
      "White Elephant gifts should be wrapped, especially if you are playing a version with a rules sheet or playing cards that dictate certain actions. Players will usually unwrap the gifts when the gift is first selected, unless the gift exchange is using a variation where gifts aren't unwrapped until the end.",
      "What is the usual budget for a White Elephant gift exchange?",
      "The budget for a White Elephant is usually on the lower side. WhiteElephantRules.com\u00a0recommends a $20 budget cap for most gatherings.",
      "Another variation of White Elephant could have a zero dollar budget \u2014 asking players to re-gift items or bring homemade presents.",
      "The best White Elephant gifts for Christmas, no matter your budget",
      "The best White Elephant gifts for Christmas, no matter your budget",
      "Why is it called White Elephant?",
      "A \"white elephant\" is generally something that's expensive to maintain and hard to sell or get rid of \u2014 more trouble than it's worth, in other words. The phrase is widely regarded coming from a legend about the King of Siam. In the myth, which the New York Times called \"almost certainly apocryphal,\" the King of Siam, who ruled an area now known as Thailand, would give someone who had made him unhappy a white elephant as a gift, which the person would then have to take care of despite not having a use for it. So while the gifts at a Christmas White Elephant exchange aren't usually expensive, they're often silly or impractical.",

Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",

      "\"The polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease. Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they're dangerous,\" McConnell said.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible.

      "Washington \u2014 Tech leaders and companies are shelling out big bucks to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, as they prepare for the next four years of a Trump White House.",
      "Amazon, run by billionaire Jeff Bezos, intends to donate $1 million to the president-elect's inaugural fund and will stream the ceremony on Prime, amounting to another $1 million in-kind donation, according to a source familiar with the donations. The Wall Street Journal first reported Amazon's plans.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also plans to send $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump's inaugural fund, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. Fox News Digital first reported Altman's intended donation.",
      "\"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman said in a statement.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX, has become a regular presence by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago, and spent $277 million to help get Trump elected.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Reddit, as well as major corporations who have donated to inaugural funds in the past, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, for information about their plans.",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump on Friday slammed a suggestion by Manhattan prosecutors that a judge should consider an option for Trump's \"hush money\" case that is typically used when a defendant dies before sentencing.",
      "In a filing earlier this week, prosecutors had suggested that Justice Juan Merchan could terminate Trump's criminal case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed.\" They acknowledged it's an option that's surfaced when defendants die before case proceedings conclude, but called it a \"novel\" solution to the dilemma of a case being interrupted, after conviction, by a defendant's election to the presidency.",
      "In a reply Friday, Trump attorney's Todd Blanche and Emil Bove called that idea \"unhinged.\" They said it's \"an extremely troubling and irresponsible analogy between President Trump \u2014 who has survived multiple assassination attempts, and will soon be 'the only person who alone composes a branch of government' \u2014 and a hypothetical dead defendant.\"",
      "The filing comes as Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have sought to influence Merchan's forthcoming decision on how to proceed with the case. Trump was convicted in May, but his sentencing was repeatedly postponed, and in the interim he was elected president.",
      "Trump is due to return to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "Bragg's office says Trump's election should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies.

      "Three members of Oklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously against clemency for Kevin Ray Underwood, who is scheduled to receive a lethal injection\u00a0on Thursday, his 45th birthday. An Indiana man, Joseph Corcoran, is set to die Wednesday for killing four men in 1997 in what would be the Hoosier State's first execution in 15 years.",
      "Underwood was convicted of killing 10-year-old Jamie Rose Bolin in 2006. The girl was a neighbor at his Purcell apartment complex who Underwood admitted to luring into his apartment and beating her over the head with a cutting board before suffocating her to death.",

      "\"I would like to apologize to the victim's family, to my own family and to everyone in that room today that had to hear the horrible details of what I did,\" Underwood said to the board via a video feed from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. \"I can't believe I did those things. The person I was in the weeks leading up to that event is not who I am now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will wade into a case over whether California can set its own vehicle emissions standards under a scheme laid out in the Clean Air Act.",
      "The case involves a section of the law that preempts states from setting their own emissions standards for new vehicles. But the act exempts any state that had rules in place before March 1966, just after the law was amended to regulate automobile emissions, that are \"at least as protective of public health and welfare\" as the federal requirements.",
      "California was the only state that regulated vehicle emissions before 1966, and therefore is the only state eligible for a waiver. In order to obtain a waiver, California must show that it needs its own emission standards \"to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" The Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt California's vehicle emissions standards.",
      "Since the Clean Air Act was enacted, the EPA has granted California more than 75 waivers for its vehicle emissions program. In 1993, the agency granted a waiver for the state's zero emission vehicle standards. It did so again in 2019 for California's first set of greenhouse-gas emissions standards.",
      "In 2012, California put in place the Advanced Clean Car standards, which aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and other pollutants by increasing requirements for zero- and low-emission vehicle sales in the state for model years 2015 through 2025. The standards govern all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles.",
      "The EPA issued a waiver to California for those regulations in 2013, and car manufacturers started working to comply with the new emissions standards. But the agency revoked the waiver as to the zero-emissions and greenhouse gas requirements during the Trump administration in 2019. In 2022, under President Biden, it was reinstated again.",
      "The EPA said at the time that California is \"particularly impacted\" by climate change, citing\u00a0 wildfires, heat waves, floods and droughts. These climate change impacts are \"compelling and extraordinary conditions,\" the standard for a waiver under the Clean Air Act, the agency said.",
      "Several big automakers, including Volvo, Stellantis, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda, have all agreed to comply with California's more stringent vehicle standards.",
      "A group of 17 states, led by Ohio, and fuel companies asked the federal appeals court in Washington to review the EPA's reinstatement of the 2013 waiver. The states argued the waiver provision in the Clean Air Act violates the Constitution by treating California differently from the other states, while the fuel producers said they are harmed by California's requirements because they depress the demand for their product by requiring vehicle manufacturers to sell automobiles that use less or no liquid gas.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the EPA in April. As to the states, the court found that Congress has been granted the authority to regulate interstate commerce, including vehicle emissions, and it was the legislative body that laid out the Clean Air Act's preemption and waiver scheme. The three-judge panel also said the fuel producers did not have the legal right to sue.",
      "\"The nature and extent of equality between the states has been a central debate throughout our country's history, from the founding to the admission of new states and beyond,\" D.C. Circuit said in an unsigned opinion. \"But state petitioners point us to no meaningful support for their novel request to apply the equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\"",
      "Both the companies and the states appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the D.C. Circuit's decision is incompatible with the Constitution because Congress doesn't have the power to elevate a single state above the other 49.",
      "The Supreme Court said Friday it would review only whether fuel producers can point to the waiver's effect on automakers to show they have standing to sue. The justices declined to review whether the EPA's waiver for California is unlawful.",
      "California and the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to turn down the case and uphold the Clean Air Act's waiver provision.",
      "The dispute is one of several to land before the Supreme Court in recent years involving the Clean Air Act and efforts to tackle air pollution.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court blocked the agency's so-called \"good neighbor\" plan, which aims to curb air pollution and address harmful smog. Two years earlier, in the summer of 2022, the high court found Congress didn't grant the EPA the authority under the Clean Air Act to set emissions caps based on the generation-shifting approach taken through the Clean Power Plan rule.",
      "But in cases that have arrived before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, the justices have declined to intervene. In a trio of disputes, the high court temporarily allowed the EPA to continue enforcing more stringent standards on emissions from coal-fired power plants and new and existing oil and gas facilities.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 10:28:55 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea's parliament has impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his martial law decree, ending days of political paralysis.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon's fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country's resilient democracy.",
      "The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon's presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.",
      "It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon's impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted the first floor vote last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon's impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon's impeachment was an outcome driven by \"the people's ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.\"",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful\u00a0K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, \"We have preserved the constitutional order!\"",
      "\"The impeachment has been done in line with the people's demand and I hope a decision to dismiss Yoon Suk Yeol will come as soon as possible,\" said Kim Su-bong, a protester. \"I'm very happy and moved. I view it as a victory of the people.\"",
      "In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.",
      "The acting leader bolsters the country's security posture",
      "Yoon issued a statement saying he would \"never give up\" and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a \"temporary\" pause of his presidency.",
      "\"I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,\" Yoon said.",
      "Yoon's Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.",
      "Han, the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea's major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han's office.",
      "\"I earnestly ask public servants this. At this moment, we have the critical task of ensuring normal and stable operations of state affairs ... I ask you to carry out your duties without any neglect to ensure that the government is operated without being shaken,\" Han said in a televised statement.",
      "South Korea's executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade minister and finance minister. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Philip S. Goldberg wrote on X that the U.S. supports South Korea's \"democratic and constitutional process here and stands with its people.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Saturday that Tokyo was closely watching the developments in South Korea but said that \"the importance of Japan-South Korea relations is not affected.\"",
      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon's decree. No major violence occurred.",
      "Opposition parties accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament's operations even under martial law.",
      "The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon \"committed rebellion that hurt peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.\" It said Yoon's mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.",
      "Yoon remains defiant",
      "In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon rejected the rebellion charges, calling his martial law introduction an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach many top officials and undermine the government's budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.",
      "Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon's speech a \"mad declaration of war\" against his own people.",
      "Observers say Yoon's speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon's approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.",
      "Some of Yoon's claims don't align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that Yoon had asked for his troops to \"quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\" Kwak said he didn't carry out Yoon's order.",
      "Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country's first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.",
      "In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea. Yoon's defense minister and police chief and two other high-level figures have been arrested over the martial law enforcement.",
      "He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. But observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.",

      "The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification released\u00a0a report\u00a0earlier this week warning that if global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people \u2014 including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa \u2014 will be affected by the drying of Earth's lands by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world's population today. The report also said farming was particularly at risk, which can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide.",
      "This is the fourth time UN talks aimed at getting countries to agree to make more headway on tackling biodiversity loss, climate change and plastic pollution have either failed to reach a consensus or delivered disappointing results this year, worrying many nations, particularly the most vulnerable.",
      "Nations participating in the Riyadh discussions decided to push the can down the road to the 2026 talks, hosted by Mongolia.",
      "\"Parties need more time to agree on what's the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,\" said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks.",
      "Thiaw said the conference was \"like no other\" in the talks' 30-year history. \"We have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.\"",
      "Longer-lasting solutions to drought \u2014 such as the curbing of climate change \u2014 were not a talking point.",
      "Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world's largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves.",
      "Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions.",
      "But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will cost $125 billion worldwide.",
      "Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues.",
      "\"We have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,\" Gomez said. \"Until the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,\" said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks.",
      "\"I fear, the UNCCD COP 16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year. It failed to deliver,\" he said.",

      "Eastern Syria \u2014 CBS News was among the first news outlets to speak on Thursday with Travis Timmerman, an American who was feared dead by family and friends, days after he was freed from a notorious prison in Syria. He said he had spent seven months jailed by the regime of now-ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad before rebels broke down his cell door.",

Five years ago, as U.S.-backed forces wrested control of land held for years by ISIS, CBS News visited a prison where the members of the terrorist group were being held. This week, CBS News returned to the prison in eastern Syria. Guards said it was still holding thousands of ISIS militants, but they wouldn't say exactly how many.",

    "summary": "A Chinese businessman who won \"a significant degree\" of trust from disgraced British royal Prince Andrew has been barred from the U.K.",
    "story": [
      "London - A Chinese businessman with ties to disgraced British royal Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has lost an appeal against a 2023 decision to bar him from the United Kingdom over national security concerns.",
      "The man, who is not named in published judicial documents, had links to the Chinese government and was close enough to Andrew to be invited to his birthday party in 2020, according to a U.K. Special Immigration Appeals Commission judgement.",
      "\"I also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,\" a letter sent to the man by Andrew's top aid, Dominic Hampshire, said, according to the court's judgement, which was published online. \"You should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.\"",
      "The letter from the duke's aid also said: \"We have wisely navigated our way around former Private Secretaries and we have found a way to carefully remove those people who we don't completely trust. Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\"",
      "Hampshire wrote in another letter to the man that he had been empowered to act on behalf of Andrew concerning potential partners and investors in China for an international financial initiative.",
      "\"It was assessed that this demonstrated that the Applicant was in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent UK figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,\" the U.K. judgement said Thursday, adding that the man had not given a full accounting of his relationship with Andrew to authorities, which it said had a \"covert and clandestine\" element to it.",
      "The judgement also said the unnamed businessman had concealed ties to bodies connected with the Chinese Communist Party's United Front system, which seeks to gain influence and information to benefit the Chinese government.",
      "The man had texts and other documents on his phone showing connections to the United Front system, including one text in which he identified himself as an overseas representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body central to the system.",
      "The judgement found the man had \"won a significant degree, one could say an unusual, degree of trust from a senior member of the Royal Family who was prepared to enter into business activities with him.\"",
      "The judgement said Andrew had been under a lot of pressure at the time of his close relationship with the man, and it was \"obvious that the pressures on the Duke could make him vulnerable to the misuse of that sort of influence.\"",
      "Prince Andrew was stripped of all his military affiliations and royal patronages in 2022 after a lawsuit alleged that he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre when she was 17.",
      "The judgement comes amid growing concerns over China's influence abroad. In remarks in 2021, the head of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency, which is akin to the CIA in the United States, called China the \"single greatest priority\" for U.K. intelligence services.",

    "summary": "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 660 pounds, or as heavy as a grand piano.",
    "story": [
      "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species.",
      "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 660 pounds, or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are only found in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 3,044 mile-long river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province.",
      "The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades due to rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions.\u00a0 According to the World Wildlife Fund, some experts believe there may only be a few hundred Mekong giant catfish surviving.",
      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 6.5 feet that weighed 264 pounds and 288 pounds, respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It's a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\" said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\"This information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\" said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region's cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",
      "\"Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,\" Heng Kong, director of Cambodia's Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement.",
      "Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray.",
      "That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the \"big fish story of the century for the Mekong\", said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong.",
      "\"Hopefully what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong's mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,\" he said.",
      "Threats to endangered aquatic species",
      "Besides overfishing and plastic pollution, the Mekong River Basin has been degraded by upstream dams and climate change, which have had a major impact on water levels in the critically endangered catfish's aquatic home.",
      "According to WWF, threats to the Mekong giant catfish include\u00a0infrastructure development\u00a0such as dams that block migration routes.",
      "\"Without the ability to move up and down rivers, the fish have fewer opportunities to breed,\" WWF says.",
      "Cambodia has placed tough restrictions on fishing in the vast river to try and reduce the number of endangered aquatic species killed in nets.",
      "Numbers of Irrawaddy dolphins -- which once swam through much of the mighty Mekong -- have dwindled despite efforts to preserve them.",
      "In 2022, Cambodian fishermen got a shock when they inadvertently hooked an endangered giant freshwater stingray four metres (13 feet) long and weighing 180 kilos.",
      "Over the past 25 years, the CFA and researchers tagged and released around 100 giant catfish as part of a conservation program that encourages fishermen to report catches of rare species.",
      "Conservationists said the recent giant catfish catches mark \"a new era of conservation\" and \"new hope for the survival of a species that has become increasingly rare in much of its native habitat\".",

      "Bolivia's former anti-narcotics chief was extradited to the United States on Thursday to face federal drug trafficking charges in a New York court.",
      "Authorities said that Maximiliano D\u00e1vila, who served as anti-narcotics chief in the final months of Evo Morales ' 2006-2019 administration, helped facilitate planeload shipments of cocaine to the United States. According to the U.S. Justice Department, D\u00e1vila exploited his position \"to secure access to Bolivian airfields for cocaine transport and to arrange for members of Bolivian law enforcement under his command\u2014including individuals armed with machineguns\u2014to provide protection for those drug loads.\"",
      "D\u00e1vila\u00a0 -- who authorities say is also known as \"Macho\" -- boarded a private jet sent from the U.S. specifically for his extradition.",
      "On Feb. 2, 2022, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to D\u00e1vila's conviction. He is charged with conspiring to provide top level protection for cocaine shipments to the U.S. as well as related weapons charges involving the possession of machine guns. According to the State Department, D\u00e1vila \"allegedly used his position to safeguard aircraft used to transport cocaine to third countries, for subsequent distribution in the United States.\"",
      "In late November, Bolivia's Supreme Court approved D\u00e1vila's immediate extradition to the U.S. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Morales expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from Bolivia in 2008, accusing it of plotting to overthrow his government at a time rising commodity prices and a wave of leftist politics throughout South America were challenging longstanding U.S. influence in the region. Meanwhile, the two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors in more than 15 years.",
      "The drug investigation that led to the charges against D\u00e1vila was started by the DEA's Special Operations Division in 2017, according to court records.",
      "As part of the probe, criminal informants working under the DEA's direction recorded conversations in which a co-defendant of D\u00e1vila bragged of having access to an MD-11 military cargo plane to transport 60 tons of cocaine into the U.S.",
      "The co-defendant, Percy Vasquez-Drew, said that \"he and other traffickers had been able to operate with impunity in Bolivia because the DEA and the CIA had been kicked out\" and remaining anti-drug officials in the country were easily bribed, prosecutors said in court filings.",
      "Vasquez-Drew was later arrested in Panama on a U.S. warrant. He pleaded guilty in 2020 to a single count of conspiring to smuggle more than 450 kilograms of narcotics into the U.S. Earlier this year, his sentence was reduced to 100 months in federal prison.",
      "Bolivia is the world's third-largest producer of cocaine.",
      "It's unclear how close D\u00e1vila is to Morales, a former coca grower. But the two appeared together in an October 2019 photograph celebrating Morales' birthday standing next to several cakes decorated with coca leaves. Also in the picture was the former head of Bolivia's national police.",
      "While the DEA has arrested numerous Bolivian drug traffickers over the years, including one of D\u00e1vila's predecessors, Morales himself has never been accused of drug trafficking. He has vociferously denounced the U.S.-led drug war in Latin America and defended traditional uses of coca - the raw ingredient of cocaine.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:12:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada could halt oil and gas imports to the U.S. if Donald Trump imposes steep new tariffs, Ontario Premier Doug Ford warns.",
    "story": [
      "The premier of Canada's most populous province on Wednesday threatened to cut off energy supplies to the U.S. if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposed tariffs on Canadian goods. This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",
      "\"We need to be ready to fight. This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\" he said to reporters, referencing Trump's inauguration date, \"and we don't know to what extent this fight is going to go.\"",
      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "In 2023, Ontario also directly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and is a major exporter of power to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Canada retaliated with its own duties on U.S products such as whiskey and yogurt coming from a plant in Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "An emergency ban on hormones used to suppress puberty in transgender young people in the U.K. has been extended indefinitely, the government said.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom indefinitely extended a ban on puberty blockers for people younger than 18, barring medication prescriptions used to treat gender dysphoria, the government announced this week. There will be exemptions for people who choose to participate in a clinical trial aiming to study the safety and effectiveness of puberty suppression, which is set to begin next year. Young people already prescribed puberty blockers are allowed to continue taking them, the government said.",
      "Britain's health secretary, Wes Streeting, announced the decision Wednesday. He cited guidance from an independent panel that suggested prescribing puberty blockers to young people carries an \"unacceptable risk\" and recommended indefinite restrictions \"while work is done to ensure the safety\" of those treatments.",
      "\"Children's healthcare must always be evidence-led,\" Streeting said in a statement. \"The independent expert Commission on Human Medicines found that the current prescribing and care pathway for gender dysphoria and incongruence presents an unacceptable safety risk for children and young people.\"",
      "The latest decision extends emergency measures put in place in the U.K. earlier this year to restrict the sale and supply of hormone medications that can suppress puberty, which may be prescribed as a form of gender-affirming care. In March, Britain's National Health Service stopped routine prescriptions of puberty blocking drugs to children and teenagers under 18 at clinics, in response to a landmark review of the country's approach to gender identity in health care.",
      "That review, conducted by a leading U.K. pediatrician, Dr. Hilary Cass, found insufficient evidence confirming puberty blockers were safe for young people. Cass reiterated that they \"should only be prescribed following a multi-disciplinary assessment and within a research protocol.\" She described the medications as \"powerful drugs with unproven benefits and significant risks\" in a statement responding to the health secretary's announcement.",
      "\"I support the governments's decision to continue restrictions on the dispensing of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria outside the NHS where these essential safeguards are not being provided,\" Cass said.",
      "The government's emergency ban took effect in May.",
      "The decision was criticized by advocates including TransActual's Keyne Walker, who said the ban smacked of \"discrimination plain and simple,\" BBC News reported.",
      "\"Evidence of the harm of the temporary ban continues to emerge, and will grow now that it has been made permanent,\" Walker said.",

      "But the party in power traditionally suffers setbacks in the following midterm elections. And Trump, who was a magnate for voter turnout, won't be on the ballot in 2026.",
      "Whatley said that even though he won't be a candidate, \"President Trump is going to be a very significant part of this because at the end of the day, what we need to do is hold on to the House, hold on to the Senate so that we can finish his term and his agenda.\"",

      "\"We're pretty excited about where we are in terms of the fundraising that we did throughout the course of this cycle and what we're going to do going forward,\" he said.",
      "Whatley said that his message to donors will be \"we were successful in putting Donald Trump into the White House, and we need to carry forward with his agenda by keeping these House majorities and Senate majorities.\"",
      "He also pushed back on the persistent questioning of the RNC and Trump campaign's ground game efforts during the general election.",
      "\"We focused very hard on low propensity voters. This was an entirely new system that we put in place over the course of this election cycle. It worked very, very well,\" he touted.",

That's why we were able to see such seismic shifts towards Donald Trump versus where those blocks had been in 2016 and 2020. We also saw seismic shifts among young voters and women voters because we were talking to every single American voter. Our ground game was very significant.\"",
      "Whatley was interviewed a week after Trump asked him to continue as RNC chair moving forward.",
      "In March, as he clinched the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, Trump named Whatley to succeed Ronna McDaniel as RNC chair.

      "But asked if the RNC will hold to its traditional role of staying neutral in an open and contested presidential primary, Whatley said \"we will.\"",
      "And he added that \"I'm very excited about the bench that we have in the Republican Party right now. You think about all the Republican governors, you think about all the Republican senators, the members of the House that we have, the leaders across the country that have been engaged in this campaign are going to be part of the president's cabinet.\"",
      "Whatley argued that the president-elect's \"America First movement is bigger than Donald Trump. He is the tip of the spear. He is the vanguard of this movement. But. It is a very big movement right now.\"",
      "The chairman also emphasized that \"Donald Trump has completely remade the Republican Party. We're now the working-class party. We're now a party that is communicating and working with every single voter, speaking to every single voter about the issues that they care about. So, as we go into 2028, we are in a great position to be able to continue the momentum of this agenda and this movement.\"",

      "\"We're very comfortable with the calendar as it is. But as we move towards 2028, we'll have those conversations,\" he added."

      "These remarks have added to a growing collective sense of panic \u2014 but a panic that many in the law enforcement community say is both unfounded and unnecessary.",
      "White House national security communications adviser John Kirby sought to assuage these fears, stressing during a press briefing Thursday that there is \"no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.\"",

      "The first, he said, is that drones are a fast-evolving technology that has seen a boom in both recreational and commercial use in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Federal data on drone registration reflects this sharp uptick in use, most if not all of which is legal. As of October of this year, there were more than 790,000 drones registered with the Federal Aviation Association (FAA), and nearly 400,000 registered commercial drones.",
      "That's \"just to give you an idea\" of the magnitude of the number of legal drones in the U.S., said Ryan, whose extensive police career included serving for a decade as the emergency\u00a0service special operations commander at New York's John F.

      "Data breaches are becoming alarmingly common, and it\u2019s no longer just massive corporations or government agencies in the crosshairs. Hackers are setting their sights on personal devices like your smartphone. Think about it, your phone holds a staggering amount of your personal information.",
      "From emails and text messages to banking apps, social media and even your photos, it's a treasure trove for cybercriminals.",
      "The numbers back up the growing threat. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 56,000 reports of personal data breaches last year. California, the most populous state, topped the charts for the most complaints, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). These stats are more than just numbers \u2014 they\u2019re a wake-up call.",

      "So, what happens if you find your phone has been hacked?",
      "It\u2019s a nightmare scenario. Your phone feels off \u2014 battery drains faster than usual, strange pop-ups appear, apps you didn\u2019t download show up, or you\u2019re suddenly locked out. Maybe it\u2019s sluggish, overheating or making unexpected calls or texts. Your mind races: \"What did they see? What can they do with my information? Can I even fix this?\"",
      "Take a deep breath. Yes, it\u2019s unsettling, but you\u2019re not powerless. Knowing what steps to take \u2014 and in what order \u2014 can make a huge difference in regaining control and stopping the damage. Let\u2019s walk through exactly what to do if your phone gets hacked, so you can protect yourself and bounce back stronger.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Key elements of winter testing",
      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

      "The \"CyberGuy\" addresses potential blockchain scams.",
      "Blockchain scams are increasingly prevalent, and it\u2019s essential to understand what they are and how to recognize them before they take a toll on your finances.",
      "For instance, John from Sunset Beach, North Carolina, recently reached out with a pressing question about some suspicious messages he\u2019s been receiving in his inbox.",
      "\"I have been receiving messages from this site for a while. Can you tell me if this is a scam or real? I don't want to pay good money to get scammed.\"",

      "John's experience is not unique; many individuals find themselves in similar situations when confronted with potential blockchain scams. These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",
      "A man holding cryptocurrency coins (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public.

It\u2019s important to note that Microsoft will never proactively reach out to you to provide unsolicited PC or technical support.\u00a0These criminals have evolved their tactics to easily convince you that your computer has a critical problem needing immediate attention.",

      "2) Disconnect from the internet: This can prevent potential remote access by scammers.",
      "3) Do not provide remote access: Never give control of your device to unsolicited callers.",
      "4) Run a security scan using strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "7) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential tech support scam. These services locate and remove your personal information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "9) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",

      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",

      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",

      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "On Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading \"kill Israiel\" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.",
      "Following the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, \"Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,\" explaining that they came \"to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.\"",

Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that \"the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,\" citing the \"fear and anxiety\" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.",
      "Though the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for \"swiftly condemning\" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to \"what is now a national antisemitism crisis.\" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.",

      "As it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was \"elated,\" explaining, \"it\u2019s a day of pride, it\u2019s a day of victory.\"",
      "The ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed \"Kill Jews\" and \"Jew lives here\" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote \"Jew-free zone\" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.",

      "Seven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals\u2019 private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s recent \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview has triggered concerns among allies and critics about his level of awareness of the details of the sprawling investigation into the Capitol attack that has produced hundreds of convictions in the nearly four years since Jan. 6.",
      "Trump is weeks away from being sworn in, a day he has said that he\u2019ll \u201cmost likely\u201d begin immediately pardoning Jan. 6 defendants. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\u201d Trump told Time magazine. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at each individual case, and we\u2019re going to do it very quickly, and it\u2019s going to start in the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail.\u201d",
      "Interviews with Trump allies, supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, online sleuths who have aided the FBI investigation, and law enforcement officials reveal an unusual level of agreement: Trump\u2019s recent comments made clear to them that Trump hasn\u2019t kept up to speed on the Jan. 6 docket. More than 1,500 defendants have been charged and 1,100 convicted in the sprawling Capitol breach probe, with more than 600 being sentenced to prison. Defendants were arrested, convicted and sentenced all throughout 2024, but the cases received diminishing coverage.",
      "Trump told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker that he\u2019ll be \u201cacting very quickly\u201d on Jan. 6 pardons, saying there might be \u201cexceptions\u201d if Jan. 6 defendants were \u201cradical\u201d or \u201ccrazy.\u201d He also appeared to mistakenly believe that most or all Jan. 6 defendants were being held in the jail in Washington, when in fact only a handful of defendants are still being held pretrial and those who have been convicted are now housed in federal prisons across the country. One law enforcement official said the interview made \u201cabsolutely\u201d clear that Trump wasn\u2019t read in on the details of Jan. 6 cases.",
      "A Trump ally who is familiar with the discussions within the Trump team said that the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview showed the president-elect\u2019s blind spots on the sprawling probe.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a more specific, updated argument made to the public to defend pardons for Jan. 6 defendants,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cThe D.C. jail is only one facet of the imprisonment of a few hundred J6ers who are in jail who have been sentenced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven people familiar with the day-to-day J6 prosecution, it\u2019s difficult to keep up with what is happening. But it\u2019s very important for the president to have a very succinct and compelling argument for these pardons,\u201d the Trump ally said.",
      "Another person with direct knowledge of the Trump transition team\u2019s planning said that instead of sweeping pardons for most of the participants, their understanding is that a few defendants were being selected who would be \u201cvery worthy of a pardon,\u201d but that the process would then continue for a few weeks and months to vet the remainder. Another source familiar with the discussion said that they expect Trump to go big and broad with pardons, but that there were no indications he\u2019d gotten into the details at all yet. The Trump transition team had no comment.",
      "Ed Martin, a conservative activist whom Trump recently named as chief of staff at the Office of Management and Budget, has broadly been involved in discussions about Jan. 6 pardons, one Trump ally said. Martin was on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, an organization that supports Jan. 6 defendants and their families, and which has hosted fundraisers at Trump\u2019s properties. Martin was also at the Capitol on Jan. 6, although there\u2019s no evidence he entered an area that had been restricted, and he\u2019s spread conspiracy theories \u2014 including one about a man he\u2019s referred to as \u201cMr. Coffee\u201d in the aftermath of the attack. Martin, who stood behind Trump during a fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants last year, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Bill Shipley, an attorney who has represented numerous Jan. 6 clients, said Trump was going to have to \u201cgo wide\u201d on pardons \u201cto live up to campaign and post-election statements,\u201d and said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the pardon process, even though he\u2019d seen no indication a formal process had been set up yet.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the scope of the pardons or commutations that will be forthcoming after Jan. 20 is going to be quite wide,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no information yet suggesting the mechanism by which those pardons will be processed has been decided upon.\u201d",
      "Among the Jan. 6 defendants at issue are rioters who have been identified on tape brandishing or using\u00a0firearms,\u00a0stun guns,\u00a0flagpoles,\u00a0fire extinguishers,\u00a0bike racks,\u00a0batons, a\u00a0metal whip,\u00a0office furniture,\u00a0pepper spray,\u00a0bear spray,\u00a0a tomahawk ax,\u00a0a hatchet,\u00a0a hockey stick,\u00a0knuckle gloves,\u00a0a baseball bat,\u00a0a massive \u201cTrump\u201d billboard,\u00a0\u201cTrump\u201d flags, a\u00a0pitchfork,\u00a0pieces of lumber,\u00a0crutches\u00a0and\u00a0even an explosive device\u00a0during the brutal attack, which injured more than 140 police officers.",
      "Steve Baker, a Jan. 6 defendant who now works as a writer for Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze and has his sentencing scheduled for after Trump takes office, told NBC News that it was clear to him that Trump was busy building his administration.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not being critical at all. What I\u2019m saying is considering all the other things he has on his plate right now \u2026 the one thing that he\u2019s not up to speed on is the actual details of these Jan. 6 cases,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like everyone is sitting in the D.C. gulag right now. \u2026 It was abundantly clear that he was not aware of the individual cases. He knows bits and pieces of stories, just like most people do.\u201d",
      "\u2018Where is he? What happened to him?\u2019",
      "Another line that prompted worries even among some of Trump\u2019s fiercest allies was when he pointed to outdated conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, invoking the name of Ray Epps, a Trump supporter who was falsely accused of being a federal informant after one of Trump\u2019s former White House speechwriters spread that conspiracy theory online.",
      "Epps was the 16th person whose photo was added to the FBI\u2019s Capitol violence website in the early days of the chaotic investigation and was quickly identified and then removed from the site. That sparked conspiracy theories that Epps was a federal informant, based on the premise that Epps was accidentally added to the list and then removed. (Many of the conspiracy theories emerged from the crowd on Jan. 6 itself, with members of the mob accusing their fellow Trump supporters of being either undercover federal agents or members of the left-wing group antifa that has engaged in violent protests.)",
      "\u201cWhat ever happened to Ray Epps? Now, I don\u2019t know anything about Ray Epps, but it was sort of strange the way he was talking,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cWhere is he? What happened to him?\u201d",
      "The answer: Epps is on federal probation. Epps was charged by the Justice Department in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of disorderly or disruptive conduct on restricted grounds. Federal prosecutors sought a six-month prison sentence for Epps, which they said was justified because of his efforts to \u201cinspire and gather a crowd\u201d to storm the Capitol. A federal judge gave Epps probation, saying Epps had been \u201cvilified in a matter unique to January 6 defendants\u201d and was the only Jan. 6 defendant who \u201csuffered for what you didn\u2019t do,\u201d and that \u201cprison was not warranted\u201d given the collateral consequences of the conspiracy theory on Epps\u2019 life.",
      "Epps, during his sentencing hearing in January, said that he now realized that the 2020 election \u201cwas not stolen\u201d and that the violence was \u201cgenerated by people like me, who supported President Trump and listened to his lies and the lies of others that the election was stolen.\u201d Having his fellow conspiracy theorists target him was a wake-up call, Epps said.",
      "\u201cWhen Fox News and the Trump cult turned on me and my wife for a convenient shift of blame, it was life-changing, it was a life-changing reality check,\u201d Epps said during his sentencing hearing. \u201cMy wife and I were forced to look elsewhere for the truth.\u201d",
      "A Trump ally told NBC News that while \u201cthe Ray Epps thing is titillating to the public,\u201d it was not a coherent argument about why Trump was going to pardon Jan. 6 defendants. \u201cOverall, that is not a compelling piece of this very necessary political and public argument that needs to be made,\u201d the source said.",
      "That wasn\u2019t the only conspiracy theory Trump repeated during the interview.",
      "Trump also said there \u201cmight be some people from antifa\u201d in the Jan. 6 crowd \u201cbecause those people seem to be in good shape.\u201d Numerous Jan. 6 participants who had been falsely identified as being anti-fascist protesters have, after their arrest, been revealed to have been Trump supporters, although one \u201canti-establishment\u201d activist is currently serving a six-year prison sentence after prosecutors argued he came to \u201cfoment anarchy.\u201d",
      "Trump also said video evidence was being hidden from the public. \u201cYou have a lot of cameras. They don\u2019t want to release the tapes. They don\u2019t want to release the tapes,\u201d Trump said. In fact, the Justice Department has regularly released evidentiary videos from Jan. 6 cases following requests made by a media coalition, and a Republican-led committee has published thousands of hours of CCTV footage from Jan. 6 on the conservative video-sharing website Rumble.",
      "\u2018Ride this train\u2019",
      "Online sleuths who have aided the FBI in hundreds of arrests told NBC News that there are currently 90 people on the FBI\u2019s Capitol violence website who have been identified and turned in to the FBI but have not yet been arrested. Among them are 59 people whom the FBI has labeled as \u201cAFO,\u201d meaning they are wanted for assaulting federal law enforcement, and nine listed as \u201cAOM,\u201d or wanted for assaulting the media. A law enforcement source told NBC News last month that investigators would focus on the \u201cmost egregious\u201d Jan. 6 cases until Trump took office, and seven \u201cAFOs\u201d have been arrested since then, along with 10 defendants whose photos were not featured on the FBI website.",
      "One online sleuth said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201ca rehash of the oldest internet conspiracies,\u201d but joked that they did agree with Trump that House Republicans should publish more Jan. 6 footage, since some of the most critical video has never been uploaded.",
      "Another sleuth said there didn\u2019t seem to be much internal consistency in Trump\u2019s arguments.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incensed that people who didn\u2019t enter the Capitol got arrested. But he also wants to know whatever happened to Epps. And he\u2019s promised to pardon everyone who was arrested. Like Epps, who was charged and sentenced and didn\u2019t enter the Capitol. But whatever happened to Epps?\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like arrrgh.\u201d",
      "Inside the Justice Department, there\u2019s a sense of frustration about the pending pardons, but pride about the work that the Capitol Siege Section has done. Even if Trump pardons hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, there\u2019s a record of the reality of the attack that cannot be erased.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t unring the bell of the conviction,\u201d one federal prosecutor involved in Jan. 6 cases told NBC News. \u201cNo one can take that away.\u201d",
      "The source said that prosecutors were determined to do their work until the end, whether that\u2019s when a Trump-appointed Justice Department official orders the investigation shut down, or when the five-year statute of limitations expires in 2026.",
      "\u201cThe mood has shifted, but we\u2019re far from demoralized,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ride this train \u2019til the end of the line, whether that\u2019s Jan. 20, 2025, or Jan. 6, 2026.\u201d"

      "Other posts suggest the account holder underwent spinal fusion surgery sometime around that date. \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d told another user two weeks before the procedure, \u201cI keep wondering why I was so afraid of it.\u201d",
      "The next month, it appeared \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d experienced positive results from the operation. He wrote that after a week, he \u201cwas on literally zero pain meds\u201d and was able to sit, walk and stand.",
      "\u201cWhen my spondy went bad on me last year (23M) it was completely devastating as a young athletic person,\u201d \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote in a separate post in August 2023, referring to himself as a 23-year-old male with spondylolisthesis.",
      "These descriptions are consistent with information Mangione shared with Martin, his friend in Hawaii. The two last texted about nine months ago, when Martin reached out to ask Mangione whether he had undergone spinal surgery. Mangione replied with images showing screws in his back, Martin said.",
      "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019s in pain until afterwards he might say, \u2018Oh, sorry. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for a couple days.\u2019 And that\u2019s kind of the beginning and end of it,\u201d Martin said.",
      "In early April, \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d posted a packing list and suggestions he said worked well during two months he spent traveling in Asia. The post was made on a Reddit group devoted to minimalist travel and packing only one bag.",
      "\u201cMister_Cactus\u201d also posted comments in May, offering advice in the spondylolisthesis Reddit group about his spinal condition.",
      "The account\u2019s final post appeared to have been made on May 25, when he shared in the \u201ctedkaczysnki\u201d subreddit a video called \u201cStreaming overdose 2024 , China\u201d showing a series of video clips of numerous people in various spaces streaming on their cellphones.",
      "On an account that appears to be Mangione\u2019s on the book review site Goodreads, he reviewed Kaczynski\u2019s \u201cIndustrial Society and Its Future,\u201d also known as \u201cThe Unabomber Manifesto,\u201d in January.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it\u2019s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out,\u201d the poster wrote.",
      "Mangione had mentioned Kaczynski to Gurwinder Bhogal, a British freelance writer and Substack author who exchanged some 20 messages with Mangione from April through June, Bhogal said.",
      "Mangione was a \u201cfounding member\u201d of his newsletter and expressed a mix of left-wing and right-wing political views. He also vented about the high cost of health care in the U.S., Bhogal said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the impression I got of him, besides his curiosity and kindness, was a deep concern for the future of humanity, and a determination to improve himself and the world,\u201d Bhogal wrote in an email to NBC News.",
      "Bhogal said he and Mangione had \u201cbriefly touched on the differences between the UK and US healthcare systems. Luigi complained about how expensive healthcare in the US was, and expressed envy at the UK\u2019s nationalized health system.\u201d",
      "During their exchanges, Bhogal said Mangione discussed spending time in Japan and worried people there \u201cdon\u2019t really live their lives \u2014 most of the young men are addicted to video games, pornography, and other shallow entertainments.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne thing he said was the people around him were on a different wavelength, and he was eager to be a part of a community of like-minded people,\u201d Bhogal added. \u201cHe suggested I schedule group video calls as he really wanted to meet my other founding members and start a community based on ideas like rationalism, Stoicism, and effective altruism.\u201d",
      "In September, Mangione\u2019s phone number disappeared from a WhatsApp group for Penn alumni in Hawaii, according to Raj George, president of the Penn Club of Hawaii. He briefly met Mangione in 2023 during a tour of the Shangri La Museum of Islamic Art, Culture & Design in Honolulu.",
      "Like others, George described Mangione as bright and friendly.",
      "\u201cHe was really excited about the club, wanting to see how else he could get involved to connect with other Penn alums,\u201d George said. \u201cEverything was really pleasant \u2014 there were no signs to make us think otherwise.\u201d",
      "Freddie Leatherbury, one of Mangione\u2019s former classmates at the Gilman School in Maryland, said he received messages from friends on Oct. 1, asking if he had spoken to Mangione. They were never close and it had been years since the two crossed paths. Leatherbury said he was dismayed to learn Mangione was missing.",
      "\u201cHe was an impressive but unassuming kid,\u201d Leatherbury remembered. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how smart he was until he was named valedictorian. It kind of just speaks to how humble and passive he was. He just went about his thing, did it quietly and did it very well.\u201d",
      "A cousin of Mangione\u2019s reached out to other Gilman alums asking whether they\u2019d had any recent contact with him, according to a former classmate who asked that his name be withheld out of privacy concerns.",
      "The cousin said Mangione had been missing for months, had undergone back surgery and the family was desperate to find him. Members of that friend group tried texting and direct-messaging Mangione, but no one heard back, the former classmate said.",
      "In mid-November, Mangione\u2019s mother filed a missing person report in San Francisco, according to two senior law enforcement officials.",
      "Thompson was shot and killed on Dec. 4 outside a midtown Manhattan hotel, where he was scheduled to speak at a conference. His death prompted a multistate manhunt.",
      "Police in Pennsylvania found a fraudulent New Jersey driver\u2019s license for a 26-year-old Maplewood resident named \u201cMark Rosario\u201d in Mangione\u2019s backpack, according to an image of the phony ID obtained by NBC New York.",
      "The same name was used by Thompson\u2019s alleged killer to check in to a New York hostel days before the attack, multiple law enforcement sources told NBC News.",
      "Mangione\u2019s arrest has turned him into a symbol of resistance for those frustrated by the U.S. health care system and has sparked a renewed fascination with a Pokemon character associated with him.",
      "But others caution against lionizing Mangione.",
      "\u201cI think the whole thing is an absolute tragedy,\u201d said New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch. \u201cYou have a father, a friend, a family man, who was killed.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 19:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar\" is soaring to new heights thanks to its recent limited re-release, with fans of the filmmaker flocking to theaters to see it in 70mm IMAX.",
    "story": [
      "For Patrick Tomasso, a 6 a.m. international flight and a roughly 350-mile journey was a small price to pay to see one of his favorite movies, \u201cInterstellar,\u201d on the big screen again.",
      "The Toronto-based cinematographer and film influencer said he\u2019s seen Christopher Nolan\u2019s sci-fi epic dozens of times since it debuted a decade ago. But when Paramount Pictures, the film\u2019s distributor, announced it would be rereleased on select screens, Tomasso knew he\u2019d do anything to secure a ticket. Even if it meant taking a very quick trip across the border to New York to see it at the closest theater with an IMAX screening available.",
      "\u201cLook what everyone did for Taylor Swift,\u201d Tomasso said, referring to the hoards of fans who traveled the world to catch the pop star\u2019s recent record-breaking global tour. \u201cThis is my Eras Tour.\u201d",
      "\u201cInterstellar,\u201d set in a futuristic Earth that\u2019s becoming no longer habitable, follows farmer/ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) as he and a team search for a new planet for humans. The Oscar-nominated film was a commercial hit at the time of its 2014 release, making more than $730 million at the global box office.",
      "Now, the film's limited rerelease is giving it another boost. It generated $4.5 million across 166 screens last weekend, with all IMAX screenings selling out. On some secondary markets online, tickets were listed for up to $215 per seat, according to Variety.",
      "While rereleasing a film in theaters is not new, the renewed success of \u201cInterstellar\u201d reflects a growing trend among audiences and distributors alike for these kinds of events. Many smaller theaters often run films in rerelease to help fill seats. In the aftermath of dueling Hollywood strikes, as well as the pandemic prior to that, studios and exhibitors leaned into a similar strategy.",
      "\u201cAt least 27 legacy films were rereleased in 2024 into more than 100 domestic theaters \u2014 in many cases, more than 1,000 \u2014 grossing more than $90 million in total,\u201d according to a recent Variety report.",
      "Among the most notable examples was \u201cCoraline,\u201d a stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film that grossed $53 million during its rerelease this summer. It was so successful in its rerelease that it returned to theaters for a third time on Halloween in newly remastered 3D and 2D formats.",
      "The rerelease of \u201cInterstellar\u201d is tied to its 10th anniversary. After the success of Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at the 2024 Academy Awards, Paramount Pictures announced the theatrical rerelease of the film in April during CinemaCon, an annual film industry conference. Warner Bros. Pictures, which co-produced the movie, worked alongside Paramount for the revival, Variety previously reported.",
      "The news immediately drew excitement, particularly among Nolan\u2019s fervent fans who have long admired his dedication to prioritizing the theatrical experience. His 2008 \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was lauded for being among the first studio films to be shot partially using IMAX cameras.",
      "Some moviegoers, like Natalie Fernandez, missed seeing \u201cInterstellar\u201d in theaters the first time around. The Miami-based research coordinator said she had always hoped to see it in IMAX.",
      "\u201cA friend told me I can\u2019t experience it on a TV screen or a laptop screen,\u201d said Fernandez, who documented her first time seeing it in IMAX last weekend with a video on TikTok. \u201cIt just does not compare.\u201d",
      "The text over her video read, \u201cnot to be dramatic but watching Interstellar in IMAX is a life-changing experience.\u201d In her caption, she elaborated, \u201cthe tears never stopped, i fear no other movie will EVER top this.\u201d",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Nolan said he was \"so gratified by the response.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really thrilling when people respond to your work at any point,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cBut 10 years later, to have new audiences coming and experiencing it in the way that we\u2019d originally intended it on the big IMAX screens and in particular on those IMAX film prints? It\u2019s really rewarding to see that it continues to have a life.\u201d",
      "Tomasso, the avid moviegoer, said he already has tickets for the rerelease of David Fincher\u2019s 1995 film, \u201cSe7en,\u201d which is slated to return in January around its 30th anniversary.",
      "When asked why he thinks rereleases are becoming so popular,  Tomasso said \u201cthe theater is one of our last religious experiences where we can sit down in a dark room, nothing else matters for those two hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really hope we can hang onto that,\u201d he added."

      "\u201cWe have to shoot more,\u201d said Guardiola, whose team has been held scoreless in recent losses against Liverpool, Tottenham and Juventus. \u201cWe have to defend better,\u201d said the Catalan coach, recognizing his team\u2019s deficiencies. \u201cWe have to avoid mistakes,\u201d he added, with his team sitting fourth in the Premier League table.",
      "Meanwhile, misery is more commonplace in the other half of Manchester. Manchester United hasn\u2019t won a Premier League title since the retirement of legendary manager Alex Ferguson in 2013.",

      "\u201cWe are playing this season without the best player,\u201d Guardiola said Friday of Rodri\u2019s absence. The Spanish midfielder, who recently won the Ballon d\u2019Or, a prize given to the best player in the world, tore his anterior cruciate ligament in September. He\u2019s been ruled out for the remainder of the season as he recovers from the devastating injury.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s issues are wider-ranging, as evidenced by its position on the bottom half of the table. In its two most recent games, its goalkeeper, Andr\u00e9 Onana, has made calamitous clangers, leading to easy goals for the opposition.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to build up a lot with the goalkeeper,\u201d Amorim said of Onana\u2019s most recent mistake, which saw him pass the ball to the opposition in Manchester United\u2019s Europa League victory against Czech team Viktoria Plze\u0148. \u201cWe managed to help Onana like he did in the past,\u201d Amorim added, dismissing the error\u2019s significance in the context of a match United eventually won.",
      "Despite the concerning play of both teams in recent months, they share a similar glimmer of hope: their strikers. Manchester City\u2019s star forward Erling Haaland still sits jointly atop the Premier League top scorers list. The Norwegian has notched 13 goals 15 matches into the season.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s striker, Danish youngster Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, has only two goals in the Premier League this season but has been finding the net in other competitions. H\u00f8jlund has scored five goals in his last five games across all competitions, providing United much-needed firepower.",
      "Prior to Manchester City\u2019s 2008 takeover from the ultrawealthy United Arab Emirates royal Sheikh Mansour, Manchester United was the heavy favorite going into every modern Manchester derby.",

      "It remains to be seen what the final arrangement may be between Russia and Syria's new government, but the movements reflect the profound shift in the country's post-Assad power dynamics, as Moscow grapples with losing a key ally and the potential erosion of its influence in the Middle East.",
      "Maxar Technologies, a U.S. defense contractor, released imagery on Friday showing transport movements at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim\u00a0airbase and Tartus naval base, both located south of Latakia on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",
      "At Hmeimim, two An-124 heavy transport aircraft were observed on the airfield with their nose cones raised, ready to load equipment. Nearby, a Ka-52 attack helicopter was seen being dismantled, likely in preparation for transport.",
      "Other forces, including Russian military convoys, appear to be heading toward the airbase.",

      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said last week that he had ordered the military to establish a \u201csterile defense zone\u201d in southern Syria as Israeli forces seize control of the demilitarized, U.N.-patrolled buffer zone, established under a 1974 ceasefire agreement.",
      "Israel says its airstrikes and actions on the ground are aimed at preventing Assad\u2019s arsenal of rockets and chemical weapons from falling into the hands of extremists who could threaten its borders or people.",

      "\u201cWe also believe it\u2019s important to refocus the Pentagon on military lethality, not radical woke ideology,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.\u201d",
      "However, some military families with trans children disagree that the provision regarding trans care will improve the military.",
      "One active duty member of the Air Force, who has served for more than two decades and has a trans daughter who is receiving treatment for gender dysphoria through Tricare, said the bill sends a \u201cmixed message,\u201d because it could help some military families while harming others.",
      "\u201cThe reason why the military has some of the amazing benefits that we do is so that when we are called to action or we are called to war, we can focus entirely on the mission and the task at hand, because we know that our family and our home life is secure and safe,\u201d said the service member, who requested anonymity out of fear of facing repercussions at work for speaking to the press. \u201cIf you want to ensure we remain the world\u2019s most effective fighting force, you should not take away care for our military members and their dependents.\u201d",
      "The service member and his spouse said their teenage daughter came out to them about four years ago. About two years ago, she underwent at least six months of psychological evaluations and received other doctors\u2019 opinions before beginning hormone therapy.",
      "\u201cOnce she was able to receive the gender-affirming care, it was like the puzzle pieces fell into place,\u201d the service member\u2019s spouse said. \u201cWe could see her, she was happy, her grades got better, she started to make so many more friends. It was beautiful. It was a veil that got removed, and then you could fully see your kid and celebrate them.\u201d",
      "The service member said that if the NDAA passes with the provision regarding trans care for minors, he would consider finding supplemental insurance or paying out of pocket for his daughter\u2019s care, but that doing so would strain his family\u2019s budget. He said the out-of-pocket costs would vary depending on whether they can get supplemental insurance. The average cost of estrogen without insurance can fall between $20 to $200 per month depending on the dose and delivery method.",
      "The restriction and its associated out-of-pocket costs, his spouse added, would put some military families \u201cinto survival mode instead of being ready for the mission ahead.\u201d",
      "The service member said that the restriction would definitely \u201caffect my decision whether we continue to serve.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a strong desire and propensity to continue to serve and to continue to give back to the military, but if I lose access to care for my family, my family\u2019s got to come first,\u201d he said.",
      "Johnson did not return a request for comment regarding the potential effects of the provision on some military families.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many families would be affected by the provision. But Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the former Armed Services chairman who is now the panel\u2019s ranking member, said on the House floor Wednesday that there are about 4,000 minors currently within the military health system whose care would be taken away by the restriction.",
      "\u201c[B]lanketly denying health care to people who need it \u2014 just because of a biased notion against transgender people \u2014 is wrong,\u201d Smith said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe inclusion of this harmful provision puts the lives of children at risk and may force thousands of service members to make the choice of continuing their military service or leaving to ensure their child can get the health care they need.\u201d",
      "Cathy Marcello, the deputy director of the Modern Military Association of America, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ members of the military and veterans, said hundreds of the families the organization supports are frightened by the potential restriction. She added that Modern Military estimates that there are currently about 10,000 trans youth between 6 and 22 with parents who are in the military, based on the Defense Department\u2019s estimate that there are 1.6 million military children.",
      "\u201cFamilies are deciding right now if they will be able to afford care on their own, or if they can get out, or if they should live apart,\u201d Marcello said.",
      "She added that 95% of the group\u2019s membership reported altering their military career in some way because of state laws targeting LGBTQ people, according to a recent small internal poll of about 300 member families. She said the Tricare restriction would further affect where service members can live and how long they serve.",
      "\u201cMilitary families with trans kids have been serving for decades and it\u2019s never been an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cTo say to these many thousands of families that your sacrifice isn\u2019t good enough, that your multiple combat deployments aren\u2019t good enough and we don\u2019t want you is unconscionable.\u201d"

    "summary": "The next battle for the House will be fought mostly in districts that Trump carried, giving Republicans hope they can buck historical midterm trends in two years.",
    "story": [
      "The demographic and geographic specifics of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2024 mean the next battle for the House will be fought mostly in districts that Trump carried, giving Republicans hope they can buck historical midterm trends and expand their majority in two years.",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told NBC News that there are now more than a dozen Democrats in districts Trump carried, with just three Republicans in districts Vice President Kamala Harris won.",
      "\u201cSo that tells me we\u2019re going on offense,\u201d Hudson said.",
      "It\u2019s a very different House picture than what emerged after Trump\u2019s first win in 2016, when roughly two dozen Republicans found themselves in districts that Hillary Clinton won, and around a dozen Democrats won seats that Trump carried.\u00a0Democrats ended up cleaning up in the Clinton districts and then padding their majority in the Trump districts in 2018. But even though Republicans won just a three-seat majority this year (220-215 in a full chamber), any path to a meaningful Democratic House majority has to run through Trump\u2019s 2024 territory.",
      "Democrats, though, don\u2019t believe these new Trump districts are firmly in the GOP\u2019s column, pointing to their downballot candidates who performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris in November and how close they came in the House despite losing the national popular vote.",
      "\u201cI think we got our message out to voters. We need to do more. Clearly, I want to make sure that we have the gavels,\u201d the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s chairwoman, Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., said in a phone interview.\u00a0\u201cBut I think we did a lot of things right in a tough environment across the country because we connected with voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans held the House this year but had a net loss of one seat, even as Trump swept competitive battleground states and made gains in Democratic areas. Democrats need to net just three seats to flip the House in 2026, and they will also have midterm trends on their side. In the last six midterms for a second-term president, the president\u2019s party on average lost 20 House seats, according to data from the American Presidency Project.",
      "The next midterm battles will also be the first tests of how both parties will navigate a world where Trump will never again be atop the ballot.",
      "Republicans, defending a razor-thin majority, are looking to turn the Trump coalition into a durable bloc for other GOP candidates and continue the trends he helped stoke. And Democrats, buoyed by downballot overperformance, are looking to win back working-class voters and voters of color who have backed the president-elect but also have history of backing their party.",
      "A shifting battlefield",
      "This year, just three House Republicans are in seats that Harris carried \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s Don Bacon, Pennsylvania\u2019s Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York\u2019s Mike Lawler \u2014 according to campaign strategists and an analysis from the National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT).",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve all shown an ability to win in Democratic districts in tough environments,\u201d Lawler, who is also weighing a run for governor of New York in 2026, told NBC News.",
      "Three Democrats who had been sitting in Trump districts \u2014 Maine\u2019s Jared Golden, Ohio\u2019s Marcy Kaptur and Washington\u2019s Marie Gluesenkamp Perez \u2014 won re-election. And 10 or 11 other Democrats won their House races even as their districts flipped from backing President Joe Biden in 2020 to supporting Trump this year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know the last time we\u2019ve had more obvious crossover targets coming out of a successful cycle like this,\u201d said Adam Kincaid, the NRRT\u2019s president and executive director, noting there could be 11 Democrats in districts that flipped from Biden to Trump depending on split precinct results in Ohio\u2019s 13th District.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are going to have to go into Trump territory to flip the House,\u201d Kincaid said.",
      "Some Democrats in new Trump districts, such as Rep.-elect Adam Gray of California, Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico and Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, represent seats with sizable Latino populations, underscoring Trump\u2019s gains among this group of voters. This also includes one election-night surprise, with Rep.-elect Nellie Pou winning a closer-than-expected race in New Jersey\u2019s 9th District, which is 44% Hispanic according to census data.",
      "The districts also reflect Trump\u2019s gains among working-class voters. In all but one of those districts, less than 36% of adults hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, which is below the national average. A majority of the Trump/House Democratic districts have a median household income of less than $65,000, which is also below the national median of $78,000.",
      "For Republicans, Trump has shifted their coalition to include more working-class voters and voters of color.",
      "\u201cThat changing coalition for us reshapes the battlefield and creates opportunities in places like Texas-28 or Nevada-3,\u201d said Hudson, referring to Cuellar\u2019s seat and Democratic Rep. Susie Lee\u2019s Nevada district, which also flipped to Trump.",
      "But Democrats say their House candidates\u2019 overperformance gives the party a playbook for the midterms. Democratic candidates in battleground districts outperformed Harris by an average of 2.4 points in counties where less than 30% of voters have a college degree, and by an average of 0.2 points in majority-Latino counties, according to a DCCC analysis shared with NBC News.",
      "DelBene and other party strategists touted Democrats\u2019 individual brands as key to withstanding some broader political forces.",
      "\u201cBoth our incumbents and our candidates running to flip seats, really have always been authentic, independent-minded folks focused on their districts,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "\u201cI feel like I know my district and my constituents know me,\u201d said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., whose district flipped from Biden to Trump. \u201cAnd I know that Donald Trump\u2019s not going to be on the top of the ticket in 2026 and midterms are often very different. And whatever happens, I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d",
      "Mike Smith, president of House Majority PAC, the main Democratic super PAC involved in House races, also said that candidate quality is key to success, along with leveraging demographic shifts and running on a compelling message.",
      "\u201cWhen we have that, it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter whether it\u2019s suburban, rural, working class or not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have candidates that resonate and can win. And we proved that in \u201922 and \u201924, and I think we\u2019re going to see that in a much bigger way in \u201926.\u201d",
      "The super PAC announced Wednesday that it is launching a new recruitment fund, looking to help with research and outreach to potential candidates in key House races. It also released a list of 29 midterm targets, plus 16 additional GOP-held seats that it said could be competitive with the right Democratic candidate on the ballot.",
      "The targets include some Trump seats that were not on this year\u2019s battlefield, like Michigan\u2019s 4th District, represented by GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga. Smith noted that Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer carried the seat in 2022, and that Ottawa County, while heavily pro-Trump, has been moving toward Democrats.",
      "Hudson said he had not seen the target list, but he said Democrats tend to target some \u201creaches\u201d given the small House map. Only a small handful of the 435 seats have flipped in the last two election cycles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got more opportunity to pick up seats than they do,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cSo they can spin it however they want.\u201d",
      "Party challenges",
      "Despite downballot bright spots, some Democrats acknowledged that their party has more work to do to win back key groups of voters, particularly working-class voters and Latinos, and make the case that the party is not singularly focused on opposing Trump.",
      "\u201cThe reality is [that] in voters\u2019 minds, for the past eight years we\u2019ve been the party of opposition. And we\u2019ve got to stand for something,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who has worked in House races and requested anonymity to speak candidly about party strategy.",
      "DelBene said Democrats should continue to focus on issues affecting working families, like the child tax credit.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on making sure we\u2019re getting things done and making a difference for our communities,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, will try to ensure that Trump voters become reliable GOP voters, and some Republicans acknowledged those voters are not in their camp yet.",
      "\u201cJust because you vote for Trump does not make you a Republican,\u201d said Sarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership.",
      "Hudson said Republicans should focus on delivering on key issues to win over those voters and continue to study how to best reach voters who don\u2019t normally show up at the polls.",
      "\u201cIt starts with: Why did they vote for Trump in the first place? And I think it\u2019s because they wanted change, and they were concerned about the cost of things for their family. They\u2019re concerned about crime in their neighborhood and the open border,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cAnd so I think step one is: Deliver on our promises.\u201d",
      "Hudson said Trump will be a key messenger for Republicans in the midterms. Hudson was also not concerned about the prospect of clashing with Trump or his allies in upcoming primaries, noting Trump and the NRCC were often aligned on key races.",
      "\u201cHe understands the importance of holding the House,\u201d Hudson said."

    "summary": "Many servers are relying less on tips and more on rising wages as diners\u2019 gratuities trail inflation \u2014 despite all the complaints about \"tipflation.\"",
    "story": [
      "Diners are pulling back on tipping, but waiters and table bussers are still coming out narrowly ahead.",
      "From January 2020 to September this year, base wages \u2014 what staffers get paid directly by their bosses, before any tips \u2014 jumped 66%, according to findings released Tuesday by private-sector payroll processor ADP. Gratuities rose only 23%. The study analyzed the paychecks of nearly 100,000 tip earners at full-service restaurants nationwide.",
      "Restaurant workers earned a median hourly pay of $23.88 from wages and tips combined as of September, up 28% since January 2020. Because consumer prices rose 22% during that same period, the data shows these workers\u2019 overall income growth beat inflation by 6 percentage points \u2014 while their tips outpaced it by just 1.",
      "A separate report released Tuesday by the payments processor Toast found tips at full-service restaurants have been roughly flat since June. They averaged $21.48 per hour as of September, only 58 cents more than the same time a year earlier \u2014 but about 7 cents less when adjusted for inflation.",
      "Like many recent economic trends, restaurant workers\u2019 pay gains are closely linked to the pandemic: Operators hiked wages to coax workers back as they reopened and found they generally couldn\u2019t lower wages once they\u2019d raised them, said Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Many industry staffers \u201cwere able to aggressively see base salaries increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot more negotiation power for these workers over time.\u201d",
      "Today, more than 57% of the median-earning restaurant worker\u2019s income comes from tips \u2014 still a big chunk but down from nearly 65% in January 2020, ADP found. That falling share could matter for debates around whether to cut taxes on tips, an idea that drew bipartisan support on the campaign trail even as broader minimum wage battles heat up.",
      "In the meantime, the findings are a corrective to widespread complaints about so-called tipflation, with consumers increasingly being asked \u2014 often by automated prompts on the screens of payment processors \u2014\u00a0to tip when they may or may not feel it\u2019s warranted. But despite an early, modest uptick in tipping during the pandemic recovery, many people have consistently shown no difficulty declining requests to add gratuities.",
      "In fact, consumers have said at least since this summer that they\u2019re pulling back on how often they tip workers like waiters, hairstylists and drivers. A new Wells Fargo survey finds only half of Americans plan to give holiday tips or gifts to service workers this season.",
      "The tipping slowdown comes even as restaurants ease up on hiking menu prices and lean into discounts to keep luring guests to tables and drive-thrus. Inflation overall has settled just above 2% as 2024 winds down, far below its peak north of 9% in June 2022. But as consumers\u2019 tipping habits have evolved in recent years, so have restaurant owners\u2019 pay offers and lawmakers\u2019 rules governing them.",
      "\u201cWorkers have been winning in the marketplace,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group that campaigns for higher base pay. \u201cWinning in the marketplace has resulted in us being able to win in policy.\u201d",
      "Jayaraman cited Michigan, where the state Supreme Court last summer cleared the way for a minimum wage hike, from $10.33 to $12.48 to take effect in February 2025. At least 26 states and Washington, D.C., have implemented minimum wage hikes over roughly the last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while 20 have raised their tipped wage.",
      "The tipped wage, also known as a \u201csubminimum\u201d wage, allows tip earners to be paid a lower hourly rate but requires employers to cover any shortfalls whenever gratuities don\u2019t add up to either the $7.25 federal pay floor or a higher statewide one. Michigan\u2019s new law gradually raises the state subminimum until it\u2019s phased out in 2029.",
      "\u201cMichigan was the biggest win this year,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cI would say we\u2019re on a roll.\u201d Advocates have notched similar victories recently in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, and Jayaraman said her group\u2019s next big target is Illinois, where a bill to eliminate the state\u2019s subminimum wage has been working its way through the legislature.",
      "To be sure, most full-service restaurant workers still rely heavily on tips for their income, and industry operators largely want to keep it that way. Many argue that their labor costs have already surged unsustainably \u2014 a reality the ADP findings appear to back up \u2014 especially squeezing small restaurants that run on thin margins. Still, Arizona voters last month soundly defeated an industry-backed ballot measure that would have slashed the minimum wage as long as tips hit a designated new threshold.",
      "ADP found subminimum pay rules have indeed kept workers afloat at times when gratuities collapsed, just as the system is designed. In the first half of 2020, \u201cwhen tips dried up during pandemic lockdown, base wages rose, thanks to laws that require employers to make up for the loss of tipped wages,\u201d the researchers wrote. But \u201cas tips recovered, base wages fell quickly to pre-recession levels. A year later, base wages spiked again, just not enough to overtake tips.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen how the decline in gratuities\u2019 share of industry workers\u2019 income might affect any move to eliminate taxes on tips, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. Richardson said the impact of the proposal \u2014 which service workers and labor groups didn\u2019t rank too highly during the campaign season \u2014 would depend on the details.",
      "\u201cWhat we can say is that the base has now become a more impactful part of overall compensation for restaurant workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be really meaningful for a whole host of reasons.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 10, 2024, 2:15 p.m. ET):\u00a0A previous version of this article misstated the time period for restaurant workers\u2019 66% wage growth. The increase occurred from January 2020 to this September, not from January 2019."

    "story": [
      "Mysterious drones in New York temporarily shut down runways at an Orange County airport, a frustrated governor said, calling for federal assistance and declaring that \"this has gone too far.\"",
      "The New York Stewart International Airport was forced to close runways Friday night for about an hour \"due to drone activity in the airspace,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement.",
      "In a statement Saturday to NBC New York, the Federal Aviation Administration said it slowed air traffic temporarily late Friday night \"due to multiple reported drone sightings near and over the airport.\"",
      "The agency said there have been no safety impacts to aircraft.",
      "The airport received a report of a drone sighting from the FAA around 9:40 p.m. Friday, said a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The runways reopened at 10:45 p.m., the spokesperson said. The closure did not impact flights.",
      "\"This has gone too far,\" Hochul said.",
      "The drones have been spotted over New York, New Jersey\u00a0and other states in the Northeast, sparking concern and confusion. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. and New Jersey Republican Reps. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot them down. Experts, however, have said that shooting them poses a safety risk and is illegal.",
      "Hochul said she directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate the sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address the drones. The efforts remain ongoing, the governor said.",
      "\"But\u00a0in order to allow state law enforcement to work on this issue, I am now calling on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act,\" she said. \"This bill would reform legal authorities to counter-UAS and strengthen the FAA\u2019s oversight of drones, and would extend counter-UAS activities to select state and local law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "\"Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential. Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people,\" Hochul added.",
      "The White House has said that it has \"no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.\" Officials have said the drones flying over New Jersey in the past few weeks appear to be commercial-grade and not recreational.",
      "During an interagency background call\u00a0Saturday, an official with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reiterated that there is no \"evidence that there\u2019s a threat to public safety.\"",
      "An FAA official said that it is not illegal to fly drones in U.S. airspace, while an official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation said there has \"been a slight overreaction\" to the drone sightings.",
      "\"We\u2019re confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones,\" the DHS official said in the call. \"There is no evidence to date of any foreign based involvement in sending drones ashore from marine vessels in the area.\""

    "summary": "Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar\" is soaring to new heights thanks to its recent limited re-release, with fans of the filmmaker flocking to theaters to see it in 70mm IMAX.",
    "story": [
      "For Patrick Tomasso, a 6 a.m. international flight and a roughly 350-mile journey was a small price to pay to see one of his favorite movies, \u201cInterstellar,\u201d on the big screen again.",
      "The Toronto-based cinematographer and film influencer said he\u2019s seen Christopher Nolan\u2019s sci-fi epic dozens of times since it debuted a decade ago. But when Paramount Pictures, the film\u2019s distributor, announced it would be rereleased on select screens, Tomasso knew he\u2019d do anything to secure a ticket. Even if it meant taking a very quick trip across the border to New York to see it at the closest theater with an IMAX screening available.",
      "\u201cLook what everyone did for Taylor Swift,\u201d Tomasso said, referring to the hoards of fans who traveled the world to catch the pop star\u2019s recent record-breaking global tour. \u201cThis is my Eras Tour.\u201d",
      "\u201cInterstellar,\u201d set in a futuristic Earth that\u2019s becoming no longer habitable, follows farmer/ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) as he and a team search for a new planet for humans. The Oscar-nominated film was a commercial hit at the time of its 2014 release, making more than $730 million at the global box office.",
      "Now, the film's limited rerelease is giving it another boost. It generated $4.5 million across 166 screens last weekend, with all IMAX screenings selling out. On some secondary markets online, tickets were listed for up to $215 per seat, according to Variety.",
      "While rereleasing a film in theaters is not new, the renewed success of \u201cInterstellar\u201d reflects a growing trend among audiences and distributors alike for these kinds of events. Many smaller theaters often run films in rerelease to help fill seats. In the aftermath of dueling Hollywood strikes, as well as the pandemic prior to that, studios and exhibitors leaned into a similar strategy.",
      "\u201cAt least 27 legacy films were rereleased in 2024 into more than 100 domestic theaters \u2014 in many cases, more than 1,000 \u2014 grossing more than $90 million in total,\u201d according to a recent Variety report.",
      "Among the most notable examples was \u201cCoraline,\u201d a stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film that grossed $53 million during its rerelease this summer. It was so successful in its rerelease that it returned to theaters for a third time on Halloween in newly remastered 3D and 2D formats.",
      "The rerelease of \u201cInterstellar\u201d is tied to its 10th anniversary. After the success of Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at the 2024 Academy Awards, Paramount Pictures announced the theatrical rerelease of the film in April during CinemaCon, an annual film industry conference. Warner Bros. Pictures, which co-produced the movie, worked alongside Paramount for the revival, Variety previously reported.",
      "The news immediately drew excitement, particularly among Nolan\u2019s fervent fans who have long admired his dedication to prioritizing the theatrical experience. His 2008 \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was lauded for being among the first studio films to be shot partially using IMAX cameras.",
      "Some moviegoers, like Natalie Fernandez, missed seeing \u201cInterstellar\u201d in theaters the first time around. The Miami-based research coordinator said she had always hoped to see it in IMAX.",
      "\u201cA friend told me I can\u2019t experience it on a TV screen or a laptop screen,\u201d said Fernandez, who documented her first time seeing it in IMAX last weekend with a video on TikTok. \u201cIt just does not compare.\u201d",
      "The text over her video read, \u201cnot to be dramatic but watching Interstellar in IMAX is a life-changing experience.\u201d In her caption, she elaborated, \u201cthe tears never stopped, i fear no other movie will EVER top this.\u201d",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Nolan said he was \"so gratified by the response.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really thrilling when people respond to your work at any point,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cBut 10 years later, to have new audiences coming and experiencing it in the way that we\u2019d originally intended it on the big IMAX screens and in particular on those IMAX film prints? It\u2019s really rewarding to see that it continues to have a life.\u201d",
      "Tomasso, the avid moviegoer, said he already has tickets for the rerelease of David Fincher\u2019s 1995 film, \u201cSe7en,\u201d which is slated to return in January around its 30th anniversary.",
      "When asked why he thinks rereleases are becoming so popular,  Tomasso said \u201cthe theater is one of our last religious experiences where we can sit down in a dark room, nothing else matters for those two hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really hope we can hang onto that,\u201d he added."

    "summary": "Selena Gomez's engagement ring might be sparking a trend into marquise cut diamond rings. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",
      "Chaf\u00e9, like many internet commentators, is convinced the choice of ring stems from the song. \u201cIt must be something from there,\u201d she said.",
      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",

    "story": [
      "A new movie about the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is sparking debate among viewers and religious scholars alike.",
      "\u201cMary,\u201d a Biblical epic streaming now on Netflix, tells the story of the Nativity through the eyes of Mary of Nazareth (Noa Cohen). The film follows Mary, Joseph (Ido Tako) and the newborn Jesus as they escape persecution from King Herod (Anthony Hopkins).",
      "\u201cMary is the most extraordinary woman ever to walk this earth, yet her story remains largely unknown beyond a few passages in the Bible,\u201d director D.J. Caruso told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "\u201cI embarked on this journey \u2014 to create a film that presents her in her most human and relatable form,\u201d he continued, adding that his aim was \u201cto portray Mary as someone we can all connect with, not just as a saint but as the young woman we all recognize before her sanctification.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe said her intention was to make Mary and Joseph\u2019s story \u201crelatable,\u201d speaking to\u00a0The Christian Post, and tell a story of a \u201cyoung girl becoming a woman in the midst of such divine expectations.\u201d",
      "While some viewers are praising the film, which has been in Netflix\u2019s Top 10 for much of the time since its debut on the streaming platform Dec. 6, others have objected to what they views as the movie\u2019s Biblical and historical inaccuracies. Others have objected to the casting.",
      "What religious scholars are saying about \u2018Mary\u2019",
      "Religious scholars have had mixed reactions to \u201cMary,\u201d as they debate perceived inaccuracies in the portrayal.",
      "Christy Cobb, a assistant professor of Christianity in the department of religious studies at the University of Denver, says the field of Biblical studies has been alight with discussions about the film. She first heard about \u201cMary\u201d through a post on Facebook \u2014 \u201ca rant post,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBiblical scholars are hearing about these movies, and then we get excited, and then when we watch it, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t depicting Biblical stories as accurately or historical moments as accurately as we hope that they would be,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d about Mary in the Bible, Cobb says. Aspects of Mary\u2019s character in the movie are based on passages of the New Testament (the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke) and an early Christian text called the Proto Gospel of James.",
      "Filmmakers took creative liberties with Mary's depiction, Cobb says. Cobb appreciated that the film's Mary is more \u201cfiery and rebellious\u201d than commonly depicted. \u201cI like that we\u2019re depicting Mary as this full character with some agency, courage and her fears at the surface,\u201d she says.",
      "But other historical inaccuracies stood out.",
      "The movie places modern conservative family values onto the Holy Family in a way that is \u201cnot supported by the text\u201d or by historical context, Cobb, who is working on a book about early Christian families, says.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Family was depicted (in the movie) as a nuclear family. Joseph is immediately supportive of Mary and will protect Mary at all costs,\u201d she says.",
      "The Bible, however, says that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary. Families also \u201clooked quite different\u201d in that era than they do today, Cobb says. Divorces were common and there would have been more people living in the household than depicted in \u201cMary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Bible, all sorts of families are represented, not just one view of a family system,\u201d she says.",
      "The result, Cobb says, is \u201cwe\u2019re having the the debate about what a Christian family (should) look like, superimposed upon this film.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe, speaking to Christian Post, said that script approval came from \u201ca range of religious leaders\u201d to \u201censure authenticity.\u201d",
      "However, only one person, Adam W. Schindler, is listed as a Biblical consultant on IMDB. Schindler is a pastor and the chief digital officer of the conservative nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute, founded by two former advisors to president Donald Trump. The movie is funded, in part, by megachurch pastor Joel Osteen, per IMDB.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Aloe Entertainment, Schindler and Caruso for comment about script consultants.",
      "Other aspects of the movie \u2014 including Mary\u2019s more down-to-earth characterization \u2014 are sparking debate for straying from doctrine.",
      "Some Catholic commentators have objected to the depiction of Mary\u2019s labor pains during the birth of Jesus, because showing Mary suffering during childbirth \u201cdoes not comport with Catholic teaching,\u201d Joseph Pronechen wrote in a review for the National Catholic Register.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Fathers and doctors of the Church, including Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, have taught that Mary alone would be exempt from such pains as a sign of her unique holiness,\u201d he sayss in his review. \u201cShe alone had no original sin.\u201d",
      "Caruso addressed his choice to show Mary in pain during labor in a recent interview with Christianity Today.",
      "\u201cRegarding the labor pains: That\u2019s about presenting Mary in a human way, acknowledging that she had apprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something like a third of women died in childbirth in antiquity.\u201d",
      "Nathanael Andrade, a chair and professor of history at Binghamton University, who has written a forthcoming book about the crucifixion of Jesus, also pointed out a \u201cserious problem\u201d for movies like \u201cMary\u201d and others that portray the life of Jesus.",

      "Why the casting of Mary also stirred up controversy",
      "\u201cMary\u201d ruffled feathers outside of the religious community. Some people have objected to the casting of Noa Cohen, a Jewish Israeli actor, as Mary. Several other actors in the movie, including Ido Tako, who plays Joseph, and Keren Tzur, who plays Elizabeth, are also Israeli.",
      "The real Mary was believed to be a Jewish woman from Nazareth, Galilee. At the time of Mary\u2019s birth, Galilee was a region in ancient Palestine. Today, it is located in northern Israel.",
      "Online, some viewers believe Mary should have been portrayed by an Arab Palestinian actor in the new movie, pointing to modern conflicts in the region. Others defended the casting of a Jewish actor to play Mary.",
      "Caruso spoke to the casting decision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201c It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum, Caruso said it was his \u201cgoal\u201d to find an actor \u201cfrom the region where Mary was born to play her.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could find a great young Jewish actress, that would be amazing,\u201d he told Netflix\u2019s Tudum.",
      "\u201cI just know that Noa did an amazing job. She\u2019s a fantastic actress. She\u2019s got this grace and beauty, and at the same time, she\u2019s accessible. I\u2019m so proud of her performance, and I think it should be celebrated. It has nothing to do with politics,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the movie is to spread love, and art is hopefully a uniter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be something that separates anybody.\u201d"

He doesn\u2019t like to show vulnerability,\u201d Wahlberg explained. \u201cAnd I looked across and he had tears in his eyes.\u201d",
      "Wahlberg started to tear up as he continued, \u201cThat memory for me still brings up a lot for me. Because it kind of made me reflect on not just the 14 years of the show, but my whole life\u2019s journey.\u201d",

      "When \"Carry-On\" begins, Ethan is your run-of-the-mill average TSA agent working on one of the busiest days of the year: Christmas Eve. By the end, Ethan's transforms into a John McClane-esque action hero ready to die defending those he loves, \"yippee-ki-yay\"-ing it up.",
      "\"It's like a '90s action-thriller,\" Taron Egerton said on TODAY. \"I read the script, and I just thought, 'That's a movie I want to see.' The buy-in is immediate. Guy gets an earwig on the busiest day of the year, puts it in his ear and they threaten his girlfriend. It's such a good set up for a movie.\"",
      "Through many twists and turns, Ethan is blackmailed into letting the bomb through security. Not ready to let innocent people die, he takes responsibility for handling the Traveler himself.",
      "Egerton unpacks the wild ending of the movie with TODAY.com, revealing his character's motivation and thoughts, below.",
      "What happens at the end of 'Carry-On'?",
      "After a tense and precarious battle in the airport between Ethan and the Traveler, the Traveler makes it onto the airplane, looming the death of everybody on board over Ethan.",
      "But Ethan isn't going to give up yet. He kicks into action and commandeers a belt loader, quickly steering it down the runway, chasing after the plane getting ready to take off.",
      "Egerton tells TODAY.com that this scene is the only part of the movie that he thinks, \"Oh my God, that's insane!\"",
      "Before that, Egerton feels Ethan has acted as best he can in a highly pressurized situation.",
      "\"I think that might be the moment when I'm like, 'Come on, mate! This is feeling a little bit out there now.' But everything within the airport, I think it's legit,\" he says. \"I think he's doing a good job of dealing with a very stressful set of circumstances.\"",
      "Police arrive as Ethan hoists himself into the airplane's cargo hold. Nora then convinces them that the safest way to save everyone is to put their faith in Ethan's ability to disarm the bomb mid-flight.",
      "With the pressure of everyone's life on the flight in his hands, Ethan finds the bomb and switches the controls of the detonator to manual mode.",
      "The Traveler, relaxing in his airplane seat, gets an alert that he can no longer activate the bomb from his phone. He then goes down to the cargo hold to deal with Ethan.",

      "The Traveler advances on Ethan, saying, \"You're about to die with everyone else on this plane. I don't even have to shoot you again. All I have to do is nothing.\"",
      "The Traveler then grabs the bomb from the fridge, leaving its door wide open and begins to prepare his parachute.",
      "Ethan uses what could be his last conversation before his death to tell the Traveler that the real reason he flunked his polygraph and didn't make it into the police academy (which had been his dream) was because he lied to cover up a crime his dad committed.",
      "The Traveler says that ever since then, Ethan's been just like his dad, \"A loser, a waste, and asleep.\"",
      "\"That's kind of the theme for Ethan of the film, really,\" Egerton says. \"He's just found out he's gonna be a dad and it's time to wake up and be a grown up.\"",
      "He adds that the line also comes from the essence of the Traveler's character.",
      "\"I think it's the arrogance of Jason's character, thinking he's got it all figured out,\" he says. \"The character is totally unflappable, whereas Ethan is extremely flappable,\" leaving this moment as Ethan's chance to \"wake up.\"",
      "The Traveler opens the suitcase with the bomb in it, only to discover that one of the cylinders of the deadly nerve agent is missing. But before the Traveler can react, the camera pans to Ethan holding the cylinder as he says, \"I guess I woke up.\"",
      "Ethan lunges, shoving the Traveler into the open fridge and smashing the cylinder inside it with him.",
      "\"Jason has the upper hand for the entire movie,\" Egerton says. \"I'm like a rat in a trap for the whole thing, so it did feel quite good to finally get my own back and be the kind of winner at the end... it felt good to finally shove him in that fridge.\"",
      "Ethan barricades his body onto the door, trapping the Traveler inside as he fights to escape the dispersed nerve agent spreading throughout the air-tight fridge.",
      "\"I like to pretend that it's an industrial, super strength fridge that's intended for containing deadly nerve agents,\" Egerton jokes.",
      "But Ethan holds solid, locking the Traveler in the fridge tightly and looking away as the Traveler's face gets redder and redder as the poison kills him.",
      "\"He had crazy makeup for that,\" Egerton says. \"He had like four hours of makeup... you barely see it, but he's got all this kind of pock marking on his face.\"",
      "With the villain dead, the plane safely returns to LAX.",
      "Flash forward to happier days",
      "In the aftermath, Ethan and Nora share passionate kisses before the movie flashes forward to where the movie began: the TSA security line.",
      "But this time, Ethan isn't working. He's a passenger with his baby strapped to his chest as he, Nora and his TSA friend and his wife head to Tahiti, the couple's dream vacation the entire film.",
      "The final shot of the film has Ethan dropping his last essential in a bin that will go through the scanner: his own police officer badge, proving that Ethan finally achieved his dream.",
      "\"I think there's that thing of pursuing your dreams and things not being too late,\" Egerton says. \"And that's a nice thing to think about Christmas, I suppose.\"",
      "What's in store for Ethan and Nora in the future?",
      "Since the beginning of the film, Nora has been pregnant with Ethan's baby.",
      "While the flash forward shows the couple happy and flying to Tahiti with their child, one can't see if there's a ring on Nora's finger or not.",
      "\"I think they are very settled,\" Egerton says. \"I think they probably would get married and do the whole 2.5 kids thing.\"",
      "He also praises co-star Sofia Carson, saying he \"really loved working with her.\"",
      "\"She's such a lovely person and brilliant actress,\" he says. \"If there ever was a sequel... it'd be interesting to see what she's up to.\"",
      "Will there be a 'Carry-On' sequel?",
      "Egerton says that if people want a sequel \"it would be a really interesting conversation,\" adding he would \"be open to\" it.",
      "\"It's kind of like an extraordinary set of circumstances, so I think it would need a really innovative, creative idea to feel like a worthy idea for a sequel,\" he says. \"But yeah, why not.\"",
      "Egerton adds that sequels \"work for 'Die Hard,' so who knows?\"",
      "Additionally, to add to the long-heated debate, he says that he \"100 percent\" considers \"Die Hard\" to be a Christmas movie, noting that it's one of his favorite films.",
      "Egerton also says that \"Carry-On,\" which holds similar connections to \"Die Hard,\" can \"absolutely\" be a Christmas movie.",
      "\"When I watched it, it made me feel super Christmassy,\" he says. \"So that's my metric. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.\""

    "story": [
      "Jonathan Bailey is reflecting on his sexuality and how its evolved over time.",
      "In an interview with British Vogue published on Dec. 12, Bailey talked about exploring his sexuality in his early 20s. The \"Wicked\" actor recalled dating a girl for a couple of years, but during that same era, he also came out as gay to his family and some close friends, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting with the binary, where you\u2019re perceived to be either this or that,\" Bailey said in the interview. \"That\u2019s how I saw it at the time, but there are so many nuances to it. My experience of that relationship was not that I was in the shadows. She remains one of my best friends.\u201d",
      "The \"Bridgerton\" star believes that even before he was \"aware\" of his own sexuality, others picked up on it. He recalled his parents support when he wanted to pursue ballet at a young age.",
      "\u201cI remember looking through the window at these girls at school in their tutus,\" he said. They were doing, like, first position, second position, and I knew I just wanted to be in there.\u201d",
      "But not all of Bailey's childhood memories are positive. He remembered a time when he was struggling with schoolwork, and his teacher called him out in front of the entire class, saying, \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t so busy being a fairy you\u2019d understand.\u201d",
      "During an interview with GQ in March 2022, Bailey recalled getting to the point later in life when he was done hiding his sexuality from the public.",
      "\"I reached a point where I thought, f--- this, I\u2019d much prefer to hold my boyfriend\u2019s hand in public or be able to put my own face picture on Tinder and not be so concerned about that than getting a part.\"",
      "Bailey is aware that there is much more work to be done when it comes to protecting LGBTQ+ rights and the community's youth, as seen through his own experience.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a confident hand-holder in relationships,\u201d he explained to in his British Vogue profile. \u201cI had a boyfriend who wasn\u2019t experienced at holding hands in public. We got heckled in London. But that kind of behaviour is now outweighed by the smiles you get.\u201d",
      "Bailey didn't disclose to British Vogue whether he's in a relationship currently, but he was open to talking about wanting to have children. However, he believes now is not the right time for him.",
      "\"I want to make sure I\u2019m going to be present. I\u2019m reading books on adoption. I might coparent with a woman, but I\u2019m thinking it will be with a man,\" Bailey said."

      "Such is the case in the new Netflix show \u201cNo Good Deed,\u201d starring sitcom legends Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe on \u201cFriends,\u201d and Ray Romano, who played Raymond on \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond.\u201d",
      "Liz Feldman's first show since \"Dead to Me,\" the dark comedy chronicles Lydia (Kudrow) and Paul (Romano) Morgan, a long-time married couple who are looking to sell the gorgeous Los Angeles home that they raised their two children in.",
      "\u201cThis show is inspired by my search for a house,\u201d Feldman tells TODAY.com. \u201cI started thinking of the idea during the pandemic, when we were all locked down, when suddenly our homes became our everything. At night, I would search on Zillow and just like, look at houses and fantasize about being anywhere other than this place that I was just constantly in. That was sort of the original inspiration.\u201d",
      "As she started looking at homes, she said the process inherently involved drama. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody selling that house for a reason, and not always a good one. And I just thought it was really good fodder for a show,\u201d she says.",
      "Indeed, in the show, the Morgans\u2019\u00a0 home is visited by prying neighbors and competitive buyers who are eager to know everything about the home \u2014 especially details of the fatal break-in that happened three years prior.",

      "When Jacob starting banging on the door and windows, his sister Emily (Chloe East) thought it was a break-in. Understandably so: Her brother was in a burglar uniform. He had taken to robbing other people's houses.",
      "Fearing for her life, she reached for the family\u2019s gun. For three years, Emily thought she killed her brother. The guilt and regret tore her family apart, leading to estrangement from her parents.",
      "Then comes the second twist, which is revealed in the finale. The bullet that shot Jacob wasn't from Emily's gun \u2014 instead, it was from a gun that belongs to the Morgans' neighbor Margo Starling (Linda Cardellini).",
      "Turns out Margo and Jacob were likely having an affair, though Margo denies it). In the present day, Lydia confronted Margo, who said Jacob only had a \"crush.\"",
      "But it's likely their ties went deeper, given how desperate Margo was to keep Jacob silent. Plus, Jacob said they were \"in bed\" the week before their final fight.",
      "Jacob had taken to stealing from the neighbors\u2019 houses and gave his stolen luxuries to Margo. The night he died, he raided Margo's drawers and took everything home.",
      "As he left, Margo took her husband\u2019s gun and trailed him home, threatening him if he spoke out. She fired as he tried to get into the house.",
      "Meanwhile, his sister also fired her gun \u2014 understandable, considering Jacob was wearing his burglar outfit. Since the family had kept the autopsy sealed, they never knew the truth.",
      "Who buys the Morgans' home?",
      "Leslie (Abbi Jacobson) and Sarah (Poppy Liu) walk away as the victors \u2014 and it was all thanks to a little bit of manipulation.",
      "Dennis (O-T Fagbenle) and Carla (Teyonah Parris) were also after the house and actually had their offer accepted. When Carla was giving birth, her doctor \u2014 who happened to be Sarah, due to a last minute change \u2014\u00a0filled her in on the Morgan home\u2019s gruesome history. Carla decided she wants a different house.",
      "When the series ends, Sarah is pregnant and a new family has officially taken over the Morgan home.",
      "Do Lydia and Paul stay together?",
      "The end of the show sees them reconnecting as a couple and finally working through the distance that plagued them since Jacob's death.",
      "By the end of the episode, they\u2019ve also reconciled with their daughter. Her parents sit in the audience as she sings a song about healing. Meanwhile, a light flickers \u2014 a sign from their son.",
      "Kudrow and Romano, who have both been in decades-long marriages, say they drew on their own relationships for the role.",
      "\u201cI think being in a long term marriage is sort of at the core of this couple, and there are ups and downs in there and periods where you\u2019re not communicating well,\u201d Kudros says.",
      "Romano says being married and having children made this role easy to tap into.",
      "\u201cI drew on how, if this was really happening, what would it do to me?\u201d he says.",
      "What happens to the other characters?",
      "Carla and Dennis find a home, but it's not the Morgans'. They are preparing to build a house on Margo and JD Campbell's property after their original house burned down.",
      "Carla and Dennis' future is complicated, too. Dennis used the gift that Carla\u2019s billionaire father sent them upon the birth of their baby. Carla, who doesn\u2019t want to do with her father, isn\u2019t aware and thinks he got the money from his third book advance \u2014\u00a0tension, perhaps, for a potential Season 2 to explore.",

      "\u201cFor reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow\u2019s political culture by demolishing yesterday\u2019s, Donald Trump is TIME\u2019s 2016 Person of the Year,\u201d managing editor Gibbs wrote in the magazine.",
      "Time\u2019s cover referred to Trump as \u201cPresident of the Divided States of America,\u201d a phrase the former president took issue with in a 2016 TODAY interview.",
      "\u201cWhen you say \u2018divided states of America,\u2019 I didn\u2019t divide them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re divided now, there\u2019s a lot of division. And we\u2019re going to put it back together.\u201d",
      "2017: The Silence Breakers",
      "The 2017 Time Person of the Year issue focused on the #MeToo movement, which had first gone viral earlier that year.",
      "The movement kicked off as sexual assault allegations surfaced against film executive Harvey Weinstein but soon became a reckoning for dozens of powerful figures across multiple industries, with women and men coming forward with claims of sexual harassment or assault.",
      "The Time cover featured four people who have been vocal in the #MeToo movement: Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler and another person whose face wasn\u2019t visible.",
      "\u201cThe galvanizing actions of the women on our cover \u2026 along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s,\u201d Time\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement.",
      "2018: The Guardians",
      "The 2018 Time Person of the Year issue featured four journalists, and one news organization, who paid \u201ca terrible price\u201d for their reporting.",

      "Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested in Myanmar for their reporting on the government\u2019s brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, were also featured. They were subsequently released from prison in 2019.",
      "Also featured was the Capital Gazette, a Maryland newspaper that was targeted in 2018 by a gunman, who killed five employees.",
      "The magazine chose this group for \u201ctaking great risks in pursuit of greater truths, for the imperfect but essential quest for facts that are central to civil discourse, for speaking up and speaking out.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe embodies youth activism,\u201d Time's Felsenthal told TODAY in 2019. \u201cHer rise in influence has been really extraordinary. She was a solo protester with a hand-painted sign 14 months ago. She\u2019s now led millions of people around the world, 150 countries, to act on behalf of the planet, and she\u2019s really been a key driver this year taking this issue from backstage to center.\u201d",
      "2020: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris",
      "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were co-named Time\u2019s Person of the Year for 2020.",
      "The distinction came soon after Biden defeated incumbent President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, and after Harris made history as the U.S.\u2019s first female vice president.",
      "\u201cIf Donald Trump was a force for disruption and division over the past four years, Biden and Harris show where the nation is heading: a blend of ethnicities, lived experiences and world views that must find a way forward together if the American experiment is to survive,\u201d Felsenthal wrote in an essay at the time.",
      "2021: Elon Musk",
      "Time named billionaire Elon Musk as 2021\u2019s Person of the Year.",

      "\u201cWe are in this new gilded age where, like it or not, so much of our lives, even in this moment of incredible inequality, are being shaped by these very wealthy tech leaders,\u201d Felsenthal said.",
      "2022: Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Spirit of Ukraine",
      "In 2022, Time named Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy its Person of the Year, as well as the Spirit of Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy and his country were given the honor after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy refused to leave Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, and instead stayed on the ground and provided support to the people of his country.",
      "In response to Zelenskyy's actions and Ukraine not backing down, Time's Felsenthal thought it would be good to give Zelenskyy his flowers.",
      "\u201cWhether one looks at this story of Ukraine with a sense of hope or a sense of fear, and the story is, of course, not fully written yet ... Zelenskyy has really galvanized the world in a way we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d he said.",
      "2023: Taylor Swift",
      "In 2023, Time magazine hailed Taylor Swift as its Person of the Year.",
      "The pop superstar had quite an incredible year performing for fans on her sold-out \u201cEras Tour,\u201d rereleasing her old albums that have shattered streaming records, becoming the first female artist to reach 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify and also releasing the\u00a0biggest concert movie of all time, \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\"",
      "Needless to say, Swift had a really busy year, and she did it all while dating Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce.",
      "Swift was the first entertainer to receive the Person of the Year designation solo.",
      "In an introduction, Time\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs explained why Swift was given this honor.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light,\u201d Jacobs\u2019 piece reads. \u201cNo one else on the planet today can move so many people so well. Achieving this feat is something we often chalk up to the alignments of planets and fates, but giving too much credit to the stars ignores her skill and her power. Swift is the rare person who is both the writer and hero of her own story.\u201d",
      "2024: Donald Trump",
      "After being elected president a second time, Donald Trump was named the 2024 Time Person of the Year following a stunning political comeback.",
      "Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to become the first president\u00a0since Grover Cleveland\u00a0in the late 1800s to return to office after losing a previous presidential race.",
      "\u201cI called it 72 Days of Fury,\u201d Trump told Time in its story about him being named Person of the Year. \u201cWe hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is someone who made a historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics. It\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that the person who is moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in the news,\u201d Time Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs said on TODAY.",
      "Trump has vowed to deport millions of migrants, slash parts of the federal government and slap tariffs on foreign goods to boost American businesses. He also told Time one of his first acts will be to pardon rioters from Jan. 6 who were convicted for crimes involving storming the Capitol."

      "The \u201cQueer Eye\u201d cast is feeling fabulous again, and it\u2019s all thanks to their new co-star, Jeremiah Brent.",
      "In February, Netflix announced that the 40-year-old interior designer would be replacing Bobby Berk on the series. Now, with Season Nine out on Netflix as of Dec. 11, the Fab Five members talk to TODAY.com about how Brent helped the series enter its renaissance era.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how after I thought, when we did seven years, that you can\u2019t really go back,\u201d Tan France says. \u201cBut after seven years of doing your job, it\u2019s so hard to feel renewed energy again. And I was like, \u2018OK, this is our sunset era, like this might be done.\u2019",
      "\"And then, as soon as we started shooting again, and Jeremiah reminded us all of just how special it is, what we\u2019re doing \u2026 it felt like the first day of joy again,\" he continues.",
      "In November 2023, Berk announced with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d that Season Eight would be his last on \"Queer Eye,\" which was rebooted in 2018 with a new cast after the initial run of Bravo's \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" in the early 2000s. The design expert explained the reason for his departure in a January 2024 Vanity Fair interview and confirmed that there had been tension between him and his co-star France.",
      "That, paired with an explosive Rolling Stone expos\u00e9 in March that alleged controversy between the \"Queer Eye\" members, left them in a difficult place as they began to film Season Nine. But Jonathan Van Ness recalls Brent showing up to shoot in March and creating a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d space.",
      "\u201cJeremiah really just went out of his way to be like, 'You\u2019re safe here,'\" the stylist describes. \"He gave us all of these quartz just to signify transparency and openness and safety and, like, I\u2019m a big rock girl.\"",
      "Brent also acknowledges his love of crystals during the first episode of Season Nine, which takes place in Las Vegas.",
      "Karamo Brown chimes in to say he's ready for \"another seven years\" of the series as they start this new beginning with Brent, who feels just as excited about his new \"family.\"",
      "Brent says that he hopes the new season reminds viewers of how \u201cgreat\u201d his castmates are.",
      "\"I sat there every day (of filming) in complete awe of what they do, you know, watching people create, love, connect, share, build, grow. It was just wild,\" Brent recalls. \"And they're so much better than you think they are, like, they're even better.\"",
      "\"Queer Eye,\" which centers around improving the lives of people with moving backstories, premiered six years ago with France, Berk, Van Ness, Brown and Antoni Porowski. In Season Nine, Brent brings his interior design experience to the table, which is just one piece of his already impressive resume that includes starring in several TV series alongside his husband, Nate Berkus, and authoring his first book, \"The Space That Keeps You.\"",
      "In a December episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\u201d Brent revealed that he had no contact with Berk after he was announced as his replacement, and that they\u2019ve never met.",
      "During his TODAY.com interview, Brent says it \"was not hard\" to jump right into his inaugural season of \"Queer Eye,\" due to his co-stars being masters of their specific trades.",
      "\"My only job when I started here was making sure that they knew that I was going to earn their trust,\" he says, to which Brown responds, \"And did he do the work.\""

      "The motion held that Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law was unconstitutional and illegal because there were no signs of national emergency and he neglected to follow procedural rules such as notifying the National Assembly in advance.",
      "Supporters of the motion included members of Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party (PPP), whose boycott of an earlier impeachment vote had caused it to fail. Though the opposition controls parliament, it holds only 192 seats and needed support from at least eight PPP lawmakers to impeach Yoon.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader for the main opposition Democratic Party, said the vote was \u201ca triumph for the people and democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation of people involved with the martial law.\u201d",

      "There have been widespread calls for Yoon to step down since he declared emergency martial law last week. The short-lived order, which Yoon lifted within hours after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it, banned all political activity and censored the news media.",
      "Yoon, 63, who once served as the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, is barred from traveling overseas\u00a0as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges.\u00a0Police tried unsuccessfully Wednesday to raid his office, where they were blocked by security officials.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his agenda in the opposition-controlled parliament, and the martial law declaration has only further eroded his public support. A Gallup Korea poll released Friday showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating at a record low of 11%, the Yonhap news agency reported, down from 13% a week earlier.",
      "Support for Yoon\u2019s impeachment had grown even within his conservative PPP.",

      "Supporters of the protesters, many of whom carried K-pop light sticks, preordered food for them. K-pop singer-songwriter IU said she was providing 200 pieces of bread, 100 rice cakes, 200 bowls of rice soup and oxtail soup and 200 drinks\u00a0so rallygoers could \u201cwarm up a little bit.\u201d",
      "A dedicated website helped protesters keep track of where they could find bathrooms as well as free food and drinks, while a bus was provided for parents needing a place to change their children\u2019s diapers.",
      "Others rallied in support of Yoon, with pro-Yoon protester Lee Gang-san saying almost a million people were at his event. NBC News was not able to independently verify that figure.",
      "\u201cWe fear that if President Yoon is impeached, the opposition will gain more power,\u201d he told NBC News by phone.",
      "Some South Koreans expressed relief after the impeachment vote, saying the martial law declaration might have damaged the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "\u201cI was so worried that the president might do something so unexpected and unimagined again if he stayed on and ruin our business sentiments even further,\u201d said Hyo-won Park, who owns a rental car business in Seoul.",
      "Advocacy group Humans Rights Watch said South Koreans had \u201cstood up and fought to protect their\u00a0democracy and human rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe impeachment proceedings highlight how checks and balances are essential in stopping abuses of power and supporting the rule of law,\u201d Deputy Asia Director Simon Henderson said.",
      "A number of people have already been arrested in connection with the martial law declaration, including former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, the commissioner of the National Police Agency and the chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized twice for the \u201canxiety\u201d his order caused the public, he vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in a defiant speech Thursday in which he accused the opposition of paralyzing the government to the point where he felt declaring martial law was his only choice.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, said Friday that Yoon\u2019s speech was \u201ca declaration of war against the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cImpeachment is the quickest and surest way to end the crisis,\u201d said Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election.",
      "He urged PPP lawmakers to vote in favor of the second impeachment motion, saying \u201chistory will remember and record your choice.\u201d",
      "Lee also thanked the United States and allied countries \u201cfor their consistent support\u201d for democracy in South Korea, which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul\u00a0told lawmakers on Friday that he would put \u201call efforts into restoring trust in international relations and maintaining the South Korea-U.S. alliance.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is not even the beginning of the end, which will ultimately involve election of a new president,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee, who is favored to win an election to replace Yoon, is also in legal jeopardy, with one conviction on appeal and several other rulings pending that could disqualify him from office, Easley said.",
      "Communist-ruled North Korea has seized on the political turmoil in the South, highlighting protests \u201cdemanding the impeachment of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol regime\u201d in a second day of state media coverage Thursday after not reporting on the martial law declaration for a week.\u00a0The two Koreas technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.",
      "Without providing evidence, Yoon, who takes a harder line on North Korea than his Democratic predecessor, had accused the opposition of sympathizing with the nuclear-armed state, citing it as justification for the martial law declaration when he announced it.",
      "In his speech Thursday, Yoon said without evidence that North Korea had hacked into South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission last year, exposing security issues that he said called into question the integrity of the results of April\u2019s parliamentary election, which the liberal opposition\u00a0won in a landslide.",
      "Kim Yong-bin, the commission\u2019s secretary general, said Friday that there was no evidence of election fraud or that its system was hacked, saying all votes are cast with paper ballots.",
      "\u201cIt is impossible to commit election fraud with our system,\u201d he said.",

      "Despite initially promising a more moderate rule, the group barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, and shut down hair and beauty salons across the country after deeming them un-Islamic.",
      "Girls were also banned from attending classes beyond the sixth grade, making Afghanistan the only country in the world where secondary and higher education is strictly forbidden to women and girls over age 12, according to an August report by the United Nations.",
      "The Taliban also banned virtually all forms of creative expression, including music.",
      "Even before the group could really lay down these laws, Farida and her cousin Zohra Ahmadi, both 12 at the time, believed they were in danger because of their membership with the institute."

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 13:16:58 GMT",
    "summary": "On the outskirts of Syria's capital Damascus, NBC News got a look at former President Bashar al-Assad's palaces.",
    "story": [
      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014\u00a0The bedroom featured soft recessed lighting illuminating elegant cornicing and the dimpled headboard of the bed below. The mattress, though, was resting on the coffee table in the middle of the room.",
      "Guarded by bulletproof doors several inches thick, this was the master bedroom in one of the palaces owned by Syria's former president, Bashar al-Assad, and his wife, Asma, until they were forced to flee to Russia this week with their adult children.",
      "Assad was swept from power by a lightning-quick rebel offensive after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family\u2019s autocratic rule, and the opulent trappings of a regime that inflicted terror and poverty on Syria's people are now clear for all to see.",
      "When NBC News gained access to the squat, modernist palace perched in the mountains above the capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, it was relatively calm, despite the appearance of having been robbed. Fighters from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, which led the rebel overthrow, stood guard, checking cars in a bid to put a stop to any more thefts from the building that was Assad\u2019s main residence until he was forced into exile.",
      "Inside, doors opened with a hefty sweep into a cavernous, marble-lined dining room with a table that can comfortably seat three on each end.\u00a0The chandeliers above appeared to be the finest crystal.",
      "It also appeared that no expense had been spared at one of Assad's guest palaces nearby. While one room had been torched and its chandeliers were covered in ash, some of the others looked like they might have been robbed, although art remained on the walls and the mother-of-pearl inlay was still in the doors.",
      "New carpets on renovated staircases were still under the plastic they came with, as were expensive-looking pieces of furniture, giving the impression that Assad had been planning to be in power for a long time.",
      "Back in his own palace, a room was set up as a doctor\u2019s surgery and another for a barber \u2014 complete with the chrome and leather presidential barber\u2019s chair.",
      "Elsewhere, there was an expansive library large enough to warrant a rolling ladder. Books including storybooks for toddlers and guides to Uruguay, Croatia and Sudan still lined its wood-paneled walls.\u00a0A copy of Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Country?\u201d and one of anthropologist Sue Black\u2019s \u201cAll That Remains\u201d \u2014 a memoir recounting her experiences working in war and disaster zones, had also apparently been on Assad's reading list.",
      "Now that he is gone, the reality of what happened under his rule is being exposed. As the Assads lived a life of luxury, their regime locked up, tortured and killed thousands of its citizens. Richard Engel reported from Damascus and David Hodari from London."

      "Hope may be on the horizon for United after its hiring of hotshot Portuguese manager Ruben Amorim. But Amorim\u2019s new formation and style of play have produced sporadic results early on.",
      "A disappointing draw against Ipswich Town in Amorim\u2019s first game in charge was followed by a crushing 4-0 victory against Everton in the following Premier League match. The high didn\u2019t last long, as losses to Arsenal and most recently Nottingham Forest turned delirium into depression for United fans.",

    "summary": "The United States and China have renewed a decades-old agreement on science and technology cooperation, officials from both countries said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States and China have renewed a decades-old agreement on science and technology cooperation, officials from both countries said Friday, narrowing its scope and adding safeguards to address concerns about national security risks.",
      "The Science and Technology Agreement, originally signed in 1979, was the first accord between the two countries after they normalized diplomatic relations. It had historically been renewed roughly every five years, but U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns in about it recent years as China becomes a growing technological rival.",
      "The agreement, which was up for renewal in 2023, received two six-month extensions before lapsing on Aug. 27 of this year, and its continuation had been under negotiation for months.",
      "The State Department said Friday that the \u201cmodernized and strengthened\u201d agreement had been extended for five years. It said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails for protecting the safety and security of researchers, and \u201cadvances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.\u201d",
      "The agreement covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said.",
      "The Biden administration has imposed export controls on advanced semiconductor chips and restricted investment in other strategically sensitive fields in China such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, citing concerns that such technologies could aid China\u2019s military modernization.",
      "The renewal of the agreement was also confirmed in a short statement Friday by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, which did not provide details.",
      "Supporters of the pact argued that failure to renew it would not only imperil government-to-government collaboration in vital areas such as\u00a0climate change\u00a0and public health, but also inhibit academic cooperation between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Science and technology cooperation has already been chilled by the China Initiative, a Trump-era national security program meant to counter intellectual property theft at universities and research institutions. The program, which has prompted multiple prominent Chinese researchers to leave the U.S., ended in 2022 after a string of failed prosecutions.",
      "Asian American advocacy groups said ethnic Chinese scientists were unfairly targeted by the program, which House lawmakers are seeking to revive."

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security team has held discussions with the White House and Ukrainian leaders as part of a concerted effort to find a way to end the war with Russia, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "Trump's advisers and Cabinet nominees, who hold a range of views on Ukraine, have yet to present a conceptual or specific peace plan to Kyiv, the sources said.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to end the conflict even before he is inaugurated next month, calling the casualties suffered on both sides \u201ca tragedy.\u201d But he has sent mixed signals in his public comments, urging Russia to make peace but also suggesting he might scale back U.S. military aid to Ukraine or reimpose limits on Kyiv\u2019s use of American-made long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s promises to end the war quickly, it remains unclear whether he can persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the fighting as Moscow\u2019s forces gain ground in eastern Ukraine. It is also not clear if Trump's team has communicated with Putin\u2019s government about Ukraine, and if so, what has been conveyed by either side.",
      "When asked on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d if he were actively working to end the war, Trump said, \u201cI am,  but he declined to say if he had spoken to Putin since the November election.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything about that, because I don\u2019t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The transition team declined to comment on whether a Putin ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, carried any message from Russia to Trump in his recent visit to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has held several conversations with his named successor, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., whom Trump has tapped to take over the position, a senior administration official and other sources familiar with the matter said.\u00a0They have focused on sharing relevant information, but have not explored strategies for ending the war or securing a ceasefire, one of the sources said.",
      "A benefit of those discussions is that they will ensure Trump\u2019s transition team will not be surprised by any Biden administration actions on Ukraine before the president-elect is inaugurated in January, the senior administration official said.",
      "\u201cTrump is really serious about wanting to get to a ceasefire on day one,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Trump\u2019s team is pushing hard to bring about a pause in fighting that would open the way for peace talks., but the challenges remain daunting as the war approaches the three-year mark.",
      "Asked if Walz and others on Trump's transition team are working with the Biden administration on a ceasefire plan, transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said: \u201cCongressman Waltz and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan are in contact on many issues. The goal is for the world to understand there is a desire for the time of transition to be seen as a strong America, working for peace and stability around the world, until President-Elect Trump is sworn in.\u201d",
      "Trump's team has not yet informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government about any potential plans, according to two sources close to Kyiv and former U.S. officials who are in communication with Ukrainian officials.\u00a0But recent meetings and conversations between Zelenskyy, Trump and their advisers have been constructive, including a face-to-face meeting in Paris brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron, the sources said.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere thus far in terms of the engagement between the Ukrainians and the incoming Trump team, including Zelenskyy and Trump himself, has been positive,\u201d one of the sources said.",
      "When Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, held talks last week with Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance joined the meeting.",
      "Ukraine and its supporters in Washington and Europe had worried that Trump would return to the White House with the view that Kyiv was the main barrier to ending the war. But the president-elect\u2019s social media posts suggest he views Putin and not Ukraine as the problem, the two sources and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Trump himself understands that the Ukrainians are not the obstacle to peace,\u201d a source said.",
      "On Sunday, Trump wrote on social media that Zelenskyy and Ukraine were ready for a peace deal and it was time for Putin \u201cto act.\u201d",
      "But there are \u201czero indications\u201d Putin is ready to make concessions or that his overall objective of having effective control of Ukraine has changed, John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said.",
      "The momentum has been shifting in Russia\u2019s favor on the battlefield in the east in recent weeks as Ukraine struggles with a manpower shortage, and as a result, the Kremlin will be reluctant to halt fighting, analysts and former U.S. diplomats say. Also, Russia would be unwilling to accept a ceasefire while Ukrainian troops continue to hold territory inside Russia in the Kursk region.",
      "A Russian hardliner with close ties to the Kremlin said in recent interviews that any attempt by Trump to end the war will be doomed unless there are broader talks that address Moscow\u2019s security concerns. Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon and ultra-nationalist, told the Financial Times that Putin was likely to reject a peace proposal floated months ago by Kellogg, before he was chosen by Trump to work as U.S. envoy to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cKellogg comes to Moscow with his plan, we take it and then tell him to screw himself, because we don\u2019t like any of it. That\u2019d be the whole negotiation,\u201d Malofeyev said.\u00a0\u201cFor the talks to be constructive, we need to talk not about the future of Ukraine, but the future of Europe and the world.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Kellogg proposed pressing both sides into peace talks by threatening to cut off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations and to ramp up weapons deliveries to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table. The plan would rule out Ukraine joining the NATO alliance for up to 10 years.",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would have to accept the current front lines, at least for now, and could regain lost territory only through diplomatic or political means.",
      "Trump\u2019s team will likely reject Ukraine\u2019s long-held goal of eventually joining the NATO alliance as a way to try to persuade Russia to enter into peace talks with Kyiv, sources with knowledge of the matter said.\u00a0Instead, Ukraine might be offered security guarantees by some alliance members. Zelenskyy has proposed the idea of foreign troops being deployed in the country until Kyiv could join the NATO alliance.",
      "The Trump transition team declined to comment on how Trump views the idea of barring Ukraine from joining NATO indefinitely or for some designated period of time.",
      "Earlier this year, Biden officials weighed whether to launch an effort to press the transatlantic alliance to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join. But the idea was discarded after Trump won the election in November, a source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "The Biden administration official said it would be a grievous mistake for Trump to push for a peace deal that would bar Ukraine from becoming part of NATO for the foreseeable future. That would amount to a great achievement for Putin \u2014 advancing his strategic interests by preventing Ukraine from becoming part of the West's military bulwark against Moscow \u2014 and nearly justify his invasion of Ukraine, the official said."

      "According to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, Hamas has now agreed to Israeli forces staying in the Gaza Strip temporarily after fighting ends and to provide a complete list of hostages, including Americans, who will be released. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the concessions Hamas was prepared to make.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when the president [Joe Biden] presented his proposal,\u201d the Biden administration official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump's warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "Not everybody shared this optimism.",

      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior administration official said.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday that the Biden administration has had \u201cvery good consultation and coordination,\u201d with the incoming Trump team.",
      "\u201cWe talk to them about how we can send a common message that the United States, no matter who\u2019s sitting in the Oval Office, no matter whose party is in charge, wants to see this ceasefire and hostage deal and see it now, that is all part of the American contribution to an effort to ultimately produce an outcome here,\u201d Sullivan said, speaking from Tel Aviv. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to keep working until we get it done.\u201d",
      "The latest cease-fire proposal stems from U.S. proposals earlier this year, an Israeli official told NBC News. Both leaders of the Shin Bet internal security agency and Mossad traveled to Cairo in recent weeks to discuss the potential agreement.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure the agreement before the end of the month, Sullivan said Thursday at a news conference in Tel Aviv. Sullivan met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha on Friday and will then travel to Cairo for further discussions on the deal.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has traveled to the Middle East more than 10 times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, did not give a timeline.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that it [a ceasefire] is possible,\u201d Blinken said Friday after meeting with his Turkish counterpart. Blinken will discuss the next steps for a future Gaza with his Arab counterparts in Aqaba, Jordan, on Saturday.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack have languished for months. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the attack.",
      "Nearly 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have died in Gaza in the war that followed the attack, according to health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

      "While Ahmad said it was still considered one of the better wings because it housed foreign prisoners, cockroaches were crawling all over the wall next to a radiator and near a dirty faucet which would have provided water for both drinking and cleaning up after going to the bathroom.",
      "At the end of long corridor with cells either side, was a room for their guards.",
      "Tice, from Houston, disappeared on Aug. 13, 2012, just days after he celebrated his 31st birthday in Syria, where he was reporting on the civil war that began a year earlier. Video emerged shortly after he disappeared showing masked men holding him at gunpoint, but the U.S. government questioned the video\u2019s authenticity, suggesting it was staged.",
      "Ahmad, an activist and citizen journalist, said that he was arrested for filming anti-regime demonstrations and that Tice appeared to be in \u201csomewhat good\u201d condition in 2022.",
      "However, he said, \u201che was thin when I saw him. His neck bones were slightly protruding, but he was able to walk and move because they allowed him and other prisoners to exercise and walk for one hour in the prison corridor.\u201d",
      "Like other prisoners, Tice had his hair and eyebrows shaved off to prevent lice, but appeared healthy, able to walk, eat and communicate, said Ahmad, who is now based in Dubai.",
      "Tice\u2019s parents, Debra and Marc Tice, in an interview Monday with \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt,\u201d said that they had received information that before the rebels ousted Assad\u2019s government, their son not only was alive but was being well cared-for. However, they said, they had no clarity about who was holding their son.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting to see, because they\u2019re attending to the prisons little by little \u2014 and some of the larger prisons, we know those are not places that Austin is,\u201d Debra Tice said.",
      "And inside Syria, a senior rebel leader, Obeida Al-Arnout, said they were trying \u201cas much as possible to find information about Austin and return him to his mother, but we have not reached a result.\u201d",

      "President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as France's new prime minister on Friday as he sought to steer the country out of political chaos following a no-confidence vote that toppled former Prime Minister Michel Barnier\u2019s government last week.",
      "Bayrou, 73, the founder of the Democratic Movement party, will now face the task of trying to bring together a government that can push legislation through the same heavily divided parliament that came together in a rare moment of unity to oust Barnier on Dec. 5.",
      "At the top of his priorities will be addressing France's ailing economy and drafting a cost-cutting budget that will gain the approval of lawmakers \u2014 a difficult task that fueled Barnier's downfall.",
      "Barnier became France's shortest-serving prime minister after he was ousted just three months after Macron appointed him.",
      "Far-left and far-right lawmakers in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, came together to vote overwhelmingly against him in a no-confidence vote, with 331 lawmakers supporting the motion \u2014 dozens more than were required for it to pass.",
      "The vote came amid mounting fury over Barnier's efforts to push through a controversial 2025 budget using a rarely deployed constitutional mechanism to circumvent parliamentary approval.",
      "Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, who filed the no-confidence that delivered Barnier's demise, urged Bayrou not to follow in his footsteps and risk a similar fate.",
      "\"We ask him to undertake what his predecessor did not want to do: hear and listen to the opposition in order to construct a reasonable and thoughtful budget,\" Le Pen said in a post on X on Friday. \"Any other policy that would only be an extension of Macronism, twice rejected at the ballot box, could only lead to impasse and failure.\"",
      "Bayrou will be expected to put forward a list of ministers over the coming days, but it is unclear how he plans to navigate the difficult political landscape that brought down Barnier.",
      "Macron will be hoping Bayrou can avoid a similar outcome and no-confidence vote until at least July, which is the soonest France will be able to hold new parliamentary elections after Macron called snap legislative elections earlier this year, setting off France's current period of political turmoil.",
      "During this summer's elections, French voters flocked to the extremes, with the leftist coalition pulling ahead of Macron's centrists, and Le Pen's far right finishing a close third, giving her National Rally the largest share of seats in the party's history. The resulting legislature is deeply divided between the left, center and far-right, with none claiming enough power to hold a majority.",
      "Whether Bayrou will succeed in advancing legislation that the fractured parliament can agree on remains to be seen.",
      "While Barnier's ouster did not immediately affect Macron's position,  his future as president is likely to fall under scrutiny if France's government were to collapse again, with some opponents already calling for his resignation in recent weeks."

      "\"The thing is, Jonestown remains a tragic part of Guyana\u2019s history, but it is also an event of global significance,\" said Roselyn Sewcharran, owner and founder of Wanderlust Adventures. \"It offers critical lessons about cult psychology, manipulation and abuse of power.\"",
      "With the support of the Guyanese government, Sewcharran will take small tour groups to what once was Jonestown, a commune settled by the Rev. Jim Jones and hundreds of his followers. It was the site of the 1978 Jonestown Massacre, in which more than 900 people, including hundreds of children, died after Jones ordered them to drink cyanide mixed with a fruit-flavored beverage.",

      "\u201cThe numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering. It\u2019s crazy what\u2019s taking place,\" said Trump, who criticized Kyiv's firing of U.S.-made missiles into Russian territory last month after President Joe Biden eased restrictions on their use.",

There has been a debate over killing the filibuster in recent years, with progressive lawmakers under Biden pushing for the move in the face of GOP obstruction.",
      "Republican leaders in the Senate also have said they would maintain the filibuster, even if it hinders Trump's agenda. The delay tactic is likely to pose an obstacle to enacting Trump's proposals, as Republicans won't have a supermajority in the Senate, meaning they will need to rely on some Democratic support. But if the filibuster does pose a roadblock to his proposals, Trump told Time, \u201cIf I have even a little bit of trouble, I go to an Executive Order because I can get it done.\u201d",
