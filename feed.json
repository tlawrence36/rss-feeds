      "\"Sonic 3\" nearly doubled the haul for \"Mufasa.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d sped past the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters.",
      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",
      "\u201cMoonlight\u201d filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs \u201cMufasa's\u201d voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",
      "Many of Disney\u2019s live-action adaptations \u2013 including \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cJungle Book\u201d \u2013 have been big hits. Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.",
      "Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",
      "Family films like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cSonic 3\u201d have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26% of this year's box office.",
      "\u201cThe box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",

      "NEW YORK -- Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent-free. And it's grabbed the attention of the Grammys.",
      "The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (\u201cWithout Me\u201d), Selena Gomez (\u201cBack to You\u201d) and Tate McRae (\u201cGreedy\u201d). Her contributions to Harry Styles' \u201cHarry's House\u201d earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Ros\u00e9, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake.",
      "2024, however, was the year Allen's work became inescapable \u2014 thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s bubbly \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d including \u201cEspresso,\u201d an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone's favorite lyric? \u201cHeartbreak is one thing, my ego\u2019s another / I beg you, don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)",
      "This fall, Allen's work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks \u2014 an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "\u201cOnce the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,\u201d Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them.",
      "When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d is up for album of the year and \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d for song of the year.",
      "Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for \u201cBetter Place,\u201d a collaboration with NSYNC for \u201cTrolls: Band Together.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,\u201d said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d of Allen.",
      "\u201cShe just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, \u2018anything is possible today,\u2019\u201d added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter's album. \u201cThe ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.\u201d",
      "Allen's path to professional songwriting wasn't necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option.",
      "\u201cI had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she\u2019s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspresso\u201d came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones \u201cwere kids having fun and laughing and playing,\u201d Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track's cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (\u201cthat's that me espresso\u201d).",
      "Allen believes \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d found success through its quirky, playful pop \u2014 because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective.",
      "\u201cThe general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it\u2019s almost impossible for the public to turn away.\u201d",
      "In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff\u2019s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from \u201cAmy Allen,\u201d her self-titled debut album released in September \u2014 a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop.",
      "Touring those songs came with a realization. \u201cI love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,\u201d said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song \u201cIssues.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to go after both,\u201d Allen said.",

      "Critics have welcomed the brothers back, with Paste magazine calling the new album \u201ca respectable collection of bluesy rockers that showcase the brothers\u2019 strengths\u201d and Rolling Stone describing it as \u201cfun, energetic and, unmistakably not-crusty.\u201d",
      "Some cynics thought the reunion was simply a cash grab, an attempt to monetize fans of the band yearning for the '90s and a good-time rock concert. The strong album and Grammy love refutes that argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we did it and we\u2019ve been successful. And all these years later we wrote these new songs and, boom, here we are,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cThe validation of that is really unique to us.\u201d",
      "The way the brothers come up with a song hadn't changed over the years. During the pandemic, Rich started sending a flood of ideas to his brother to see what clicked with him.",
      "Chris wrote the lyrics for \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d in 20 minutes after Rich \u2014 inspired by AC/DC \u2014 sent him a killer riff. \u201cRich just handed me a hanging curveball. \u2018I can hit this,\u2019 you know what I mean?\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have to emphasize how much fun we\u2019re having in this band.\u201d",
      "One difference this time was the addition of an outside producer. The Robinson brothers had produced all The Black Crowes albums after their second and wanted a new element.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s bring in someone that\u2019s going to challenge us a little bit and maybe would have a point of view that we don\u2019t have.\u2019 Someone that can look at everything from 10,000 feet,\u201d says Rich Robinson.",
      "That happened with producer Jay Joyce, who has worked with artists like Cage the Elephant, Lainey Wilson and Eric Church. Joyce pushed them and was able to negotiate the sibling rivalry, what some call the U.S. equivalent to Oasis.",
      "\u201cOur story connects with people because if you have siblings, you understand the dynamic of that \u2014 how amazing it is and how difficult it can be,\u201d says Chris Robinson.",
      "His brother agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs, we've had our trials and tribulations, and we kind of came out stronger in the end. Chris and I\u2019s relationship is in the best place it\u2019s been probably in our lives.\u201d",
      "The brothers hint about that on the album's last song \u2014 \u201cKindred Friends\u201d \u2014 which strikes a loving, wistful note. \u201cKindred friend, where have you been?/Guess it's been a while/Through thick and thin/Many times again/Always makes me smile.\u201d",
      "The Robinsons say the song is partly about them but could be a toast to an old lover and is also reaching out to their fans after all these years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sweetness to it,\u201d says Rich Robinson. \u201cI sent it to Chris and what he sang on it was really moving. It\u2019s a great way to end that record, you know?\u201d",

      "\u2018Tis the season for spirited and winless debates about what the best Christmas movie is. No one needs us to remind you about the obvious holiday movies playing on repeat on cable, whether it's \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \u201cHome Alone\" or \u201cLove, Actually,\" or even those holiday adjacent classics like \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But perhaps you are looking to go beyond the obvious this year (sorry, \u201cChristmas Story,\" \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d etc, etc).",
      "Associated Press Film Writers Jake Coyle and Lindsey Bahr have you covered with the best Christmas films for every mood.",
      "\u201cGrand Budapest Hotel\u201d: Truthfully, there\u2019s nothing outside of a little snow to make Wes Anderson\u2019s 2014 delight a Christmas movie. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another movie that better resembles the experience of opening a present than \u201cGrand Budapest Hotel.\u201d Unwrap Anderson\u2019s intricate designs and the movie\u2019s Russian doll-like narratives, and smile. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMetropolitan\u201d (1990): Who among us hasn\u2019t dreamt of doing debutante season in New York? Maybe don\u2019t answer that, but Whit Stillman\u2019s \u201cMetropolitan,\u201d about a few privileged youths on the Upper East Side, is the ideal film to turn on when you\u2019re craving something that feels like an elegant evening on the town but doesn't require breaking out the white tie and ball gowns. (Streaming on Criterion, MAX, Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cA Muppets Christmas Carol\u201d (1992): It\u2019s one thing to do Dickens with, you know, other humans. But Michael Caine gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Ebenezer Scrooge while sharing the screen with the likes of Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. To be fair, though, Gonzo the Great and Rizzo the Rat are also really good in this. (Streaming on Disney+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d (1964): Jacques Demy\u2019s technicolor musical isn\u2019t exclusively set at Christmas, but its final tearjerker scene at that snowy gas station is enough for me. The whole candy-colored experience, from Catherine Deneuve\u2019s whimsical bows to Michel Legrand\u2019s sweeping, melancholy score just feels right around the holidays. (Streaming on The Criterion Channel) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d: Yuletide traditions don\u2019t normally include a motormouth Robert Downey Jr., but Shane Black\u2019s 2005 neo-noir black comedy is worth revisiting perennially whether or not it technically qualifies as a Christmas movie. In \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn\u2019t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz\u2019s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the \u201cmeet cute.\u201d (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d: I\u2019ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d the Christmas backdrop isn\u2019t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cKlaus\u201d: There\u2019s such a steady stream of mediocre or worse holiday movies that it can be easy to miss when a gem arrives. Sergio Pablos\u2019 2019 animated Netflix film was basically an origin story for Santa Claus by way of a desperate postman stationed in a remote northern village. Further proof, along with \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d that the best Christmas movies hinge on the postal service. (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas\u201d (2021): Clocking in at only 30 minutes, this is the perfect film for the littlest ones in the house. It\u2019s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d: Robert Benton\u2019s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It\u2019s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That\u2019s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cCarol\u201d (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn\u2019t catch Cate Blanchett\u2019s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cCarol\u201d would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, \u201cCarol\u201d is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d (1945): You don\u2019t have to watch it on TCM but it\u2019s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it\u2019s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of \u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d \u2013 that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn\u2019t that fun \u2013 has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cLittle Women\u201d (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cLittle Women\u201d just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth\u2019s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig\u2019s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) \u2014 Bahr",
      "\u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there\u2019s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn't shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says \u201cMr. Matuschek.\u201d (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d (1947): It\u2019s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton\u2019s \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It\u2019s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O\u2019Hara\u2019s single working mom, Natalie Wood\u2019s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it\u2019s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day.

      "London\u2019s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.",
      "Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\u201cI like it. There\u2019s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,\u201d said Grace Idiart, 9. \u201cIf their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.\u201d",
      "Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.",
      "Music isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It\u2019s minimalist and designed to calm.",
      "But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.",
      "Mood Media \u2013 formerly known as Muzak \u2013 develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who\u2019s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.",
      "\u201cWe see it as a soundscape,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cWe design for all of these moments.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a science to Mood Music\u2019s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.",
      "\u201cHow do we want to affect their mood at that moment?\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Here\u2019s a load of songs.\u2019 It\u2019s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.\u201d",
      "At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they\u2019re passing through.",
      "Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.",
      "Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cThe idea was like, \u2019Man, why doesn\u2019t Seattle have music? We\u2019re a music city too,\u201d Kuiken said.",
      "At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s anxiety levels are very high when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d Kuiken said. \u201cThe feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.\u201d",
      "The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.",
      "David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle\u2019s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he\u2019s gained new fans from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, \u2018That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cSo it feels like it\u2019s especially therapeutic for people.\u201d",
      "Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.",
      "Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that\u2019s meant to be actively listened to \u2013 like live music or catchy pop songs \u2013 can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports \u2013 especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.",
      "But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.",
      "\u201cA well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren\u2019t particularly cognizant of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just know they\u2019re having a good time and that it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",

      "Now caretaker of his dad's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run",
      "NEW YORK -- Only recently given stewardship over his late father's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.",
      "The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents' 1971 song \"Happy Christmas (War is Over\")\" and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album \u201cMind Games,\u201d originally released in 1973.",
      "\u201cIt feels overwhelming and surreal,\u201d said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono's interactive art project \u201cWish Tree.\u201d",
      "For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was murdered in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It's more than a preservation mission: On \u201cMind Games,\u201d he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon's music to create something entirely new.",
      "Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father's \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall's reissue of his dad's \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with \u201cMind Games.\u201d",
      "Besides the music, the innovative box is modeled after one of his mother's art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included \u2014 \u201cmind games,\u201d remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.",
      "Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he'd hear fans singing his father's music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. \u201cIt was pretty clear to me that wasn't happening with my friends,\u201d he said.",
      "His father's music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.",
      "\u201cI think I would have rebelled more against my dad's \u2014 and my mom's \u2014 music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause he wasn't around, I've always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.\u201d",
      "He inherited the job of keeping his father's music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.",
      "In liner notes for \u201cMind Games,\u201d Lennon explains that \u201cthe only meaningful way that I can show my love to him\u201d is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture's consciousness. That's poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?",
      "\u201cWhat else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?\u201d he said. \u201cI can't actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.\u201d",
      "That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. \u201cit was like the president was visiting,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Only after he began the \u201cMind Games\u201d project did Lennon learn that the album wasn't particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.",
      "That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called \u201cBrutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.\u201d In an unsigned review, the author said the \u201cMind Games\u201d reissue defines overkill. \u201cYou can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.\u201d",
      "That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn't really connect was because it wasn't promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.",
      "Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon's \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d album \u2014 most visibly on \u201cAisumasen (I'm Sorry),\u201d one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon's notorious \u201clost weekend\u201d separation from Ono.",
      "Different versions of the title cut also show Sean's approach. There's the original \u201cMind Games,\u201d with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That's stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of \u201cMake Love, Not War,\u201d a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.",
      "He didn't have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon's demo of \u201cI'm the Greatest,\u201d a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.",
      "In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father's.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who feel that it's taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThe way I look at it is, if I'm going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don't think it's helping, then I'm going to do that.\u201d",
      "For anyone who wants the original versions, they're readily available.",
      "\u201cIt's very forensic work,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not worried about what someone else is going to think. I'm just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else's music.\u201d",
      "As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described \u201cIntuition\u201d as a good song where he didn't nail the lyrics. The \u201cGet Back\u201d film of recording sessions for the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album showed the Beatles as humans who didn't hand songs down from Mount Olympus.",
      "Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the \u201cOne to One\u201d concerts involving his father and a reissue of the \u201cWalls and Bridges\u201d album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album, \u201cAsterisms,\u201d this year.",
      "Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn't want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn't hold back anymore. \u201cNow I'm too old to care,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn't get into music because I had some great talent or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",

I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture.

      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",

      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",

      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",
      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still.",
      "In Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the Spanish director\u2019s first English-language feature film, Julianne Moore plays Ingrid, a celebrated author who\u2019s just written a book about death. She\u2019s at a book signing in New York when she hears that an old friend, a war correspondent named Martha Hunt ( Tilda Swinton ), has been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Ingrid rushes to Martha in the hospital, and the two friends, who haven\u2019t seen each other in years, quickly get reacquainted. Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

    "summary": "No one was expecting it",
    "story": [
      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

      "The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.",
      "At Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost $12 million into an account in the name of J, were a \u201cstraightforward cheat\u201d of the tax authorities.",

      "Hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion has asked a court to issue a restraining order against rapper Tory Lanez",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d star James Kennedy says he is determined to make changes and seek sobriety after he was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor domestic violence for allegedly throwing his girlfriend to the ground.",
      "\u201cI am committed to making meaningful changes in my life,\u201d he said Tuesday via Instagram, in his first public statement since the arrest. \u201cI am taking time to focus on my sobriety, personal growth, and being present for my loved ones. Navigating challenging moments is not easy, but I am determined to learn, grow, and move forward.\u201d",
      "Late on the night of Dec. 10, officers in Burbank, near Los Angeles, were sent to a residence after a report of a man and woman arguing, according to police records. A woman told officers that her boyfriend lifted and threw her to the ground.",
      "Kennedy, 32, whose legal name is James Kennedy Georgiou, was arrested and released from jail after posting bail. The Burbank city attorney was to determine whether he would be charged; there was no immediate reply to an email seeking comment on whether charges are planned.",
      "Authorities did not name the woman involved, but Kennedy is in a relationship with his \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d co-star Ally Lewber.",
      "In her own Instagram statement on Saturday, Lewber said, \u201cThank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me. I\u2019m okay and taking the time I need right now.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the London-born reality TV star and DJ, has appeared on 10 seasons of \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d a Bravo and Peacock series based on the lives of workers at the swank restaurants of \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d alum Lisa Vanderpump.",
      "The show is set to be rebooted with a new cast for its 12th season."

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled shortlists in 10 categories Tuesday, including for documentary, international feature, best song and score.",
      "Two musicals, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d were well represented in the categories. Netflix\u2019s audacious transgender drug-lord drama \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d was most named, advancing in international feature, original score, two original songs including \u201cMi Camino\u201d and \u201cEl Mal\u201d (performed by Zoe Salda\u00f1a), sound and hair and makeup.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d also moved forward in several categories, like hair and makeup, original score, sound and visual effects. The adaptation of the Broadway musical did not include original songs and therefore wasn\u2019t eligible in that category.",
      "The song semifinalists include several notable artists, like Pharrell Williams for \u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d Lainey Wilson for her \u201cTwisters\u201d song \u201cOut of Oklahoma,\u201d Elton John and Brandi Carlile for \u201cNever Too Late\u201d and Robbie Williams for \u201cForbidden Road\u201d from \u201cBetter Man.\u201d Diane Warren may also be heading for a 16th nomination for her song from \u201cThe Six Triple Eight.\u201d Nicholas Britell\u2019s \u201cWinter Coat,\u201d performed by Saoirse Ronan in \u201cBlitz,\u201d was also included, as was Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s \u201cTell Me It\u2019s You\u201d from \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d performed by Aaron Pierre and Tiffany Boone.",

      "As most of the shortlists are in below-the-line categories celebrating crafts, there are also films that aren\u2019t necessarily the most obvious of Oscar contenders. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d was singled out for both sound and visual effects, as was \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d which also got a nod for score.",
      "\u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d included in visual effects, sound and makeup and hair, was notably not among the 20 score finalists. Hans Zimmer\u2019s work was not eligible because it contained too much preexisting music from the first \u201cDune.\u201d He did make the cut for \u201cBlitz,\u201d however, as did Danny Elfman for \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d Kris Bowers for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bryce Dessner for \u201cSing Sing\u201d and Daniel Blumberg for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.",
      "These lists will narrow to five when final nominations are announced on Jan. 17. The 97th Oscars, hosted by Conan O\u2019Brien, will be held on Sunday, March 2, broadcasting on ABC and streaming live on Hulu."

      "A judge has ruled that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A judge ruled Friday that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment, though Planned Parenthood said the decision is still not sufficient for it to resume providing abortions in the state.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion ban \u201cis directly at odds\u201d with a constitutional amendment creating a right to abortion that won voter approval in the November election. The judge also blocked the state from enforcing numerous other abortion restrictions, including a 72-hour waiting period and an informed consent law that required patients to be given certain state-mandated information before receiving an abortion.",
      "But the judge declined to block several other contested abortion laws, including one requiring abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities cannot comply with some of the licensing requirements, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "\u201cWhile Planned Parenthood stands ready to start providing abortions in Missouri again as soon as the Court permits, the abortion restrictions remaining in effect \u2014 including Missouri\u2019s medically unnecessary and discriminatory clinic licensing requirement \u2013 make this impossible,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. The Missouri amendment did not specifically override any laws. Instead, advocates had to ask a court to knock down specific laws that they believe are now unconstitutional.",
      "Zhang\u2019s injunction is preliminary, but it signals that the judge is likely to ultimately find the abortion ban unconstitutional as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "Missouri had been among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, a Republican and abortion opponent, previously issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions would be legal when the amendment took effect.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Zhang declined to block several contested Missouri abortion laws, including the licensure law, another limiting only physicians to performing abortions and still another requiring in-person appointments before abortions.",
      "Among the laws blocked by Friday's order was one prohibiting abortions solely because of a diagnosis indicating Down Syndrome. Also blocked was a telemedicine ban that requires a physician to be physically present in the room while a patient takes an abortion-causing medication. And the judge barred enforcement of another law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is performed.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy."

      "Roberson, who had been scheduled to be die by lethal injection in October, would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that medical experts have questioned.",
      "The latest unsuccessful effort to have Roberson testify comes after Texas' attorney general asked a court to block a second legislative subpoena issued by lawmakers, who are running out of time until the Legislature reconvenes in January and the subpoena expires.",
      "\u201cWe have been attempting to fight accommodation since October, and they have never responded to anything meaningfully because they don\u2019t want to have Robert here,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to halt Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of killing his daughter in 2003. Prosecutors argued that he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what's called shaken baby syndrome.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and medical experts have expressed doubts over the shaken baby diagnosis used to convict Roberson and say his daughter likely died from symptoms of severe pneumonia.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has staunchly defended Roberson\u2019s conviction and said the science around shaken baby syndrome has not changed enough to absolve his guilt.",
      "In the court order, Paxton\u2019s office said that \u201cit is not the role of the Legislature to adjudicate offenses\u201d and that lawmakers overstepped their power when they halted his execution.",
      "The Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence issued their first subpoena for Roberson to testify one day before his scheduled execution \u2014 an unprecedent legal maneuver that successfully staved off his execution.",
      "A new execution date has not been set.",
      "Texas has a \u201cjunk science law\u201d that allows people wrongfully convicted on dubious science to have their sentences overturned. The House committee said they wanted Roberson to testify about this law and how they believe it has not worked as intended for his case. Criminal justice advocates say the state's highest criminal court has deliberately misinterpreted the law.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it cannot be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has maintained that Roberson was rightfully convicted. The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted unanimously to not recommend him clemency in October.",

      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Specialty pharmacies and online companies that have been selling off-brand copies of two blockbuster drugs for obesity and diabetes will need to phase out their versions next year under a federal decision issued Thursday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said that a nationwide shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro has been resolved, eliminating the need for copycat versions of the drugs that have become wildly popular with Americans trying to lose weight.",
      "The decision is a win for Lilly \u2014 which had been pressing the FDA to take the step for months \u2014 and is expected to impact how patients access the drugs, including how much they pay.",
      "Zepbound is FDA-approved to treat obesity and Mounjaro is approved for diabetes. They use the same active ingredient, tirzepatide.",
      "The FDA said Thursday that \u201cLilly\u2019s supply is currently meeting or exceeding demand,\u201d after two years of shortages.",
      "Both drugs are part of the GLP-1 class that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness. Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 competing drugs from Novo Nordisk \u2014 remain on the FDA\u2019s shortage list.",
      "With demand for GLP-1 drugs booming, compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies like Hims and Ro have jumped into the market, selling cheaper versions online. People can usually get a month's supply for several hundred dollars.",
      "Thursday\u2019s decision gives businesses between 60 and 90 days, depending on their size, to phase out their products.",
      "The FDA permits compounded versions of brand name drugs when they are in shortage, and the shift back to Lilly\u2019s medications could improve safety for consumers. The FDA warned patients last year about problems with the ingredients and formulations of some GLP-1 drugs sold online. The agency has limited oversight of compounding pharmacies, which are primarily overseen by state authorities.",
      "Compounding pharmacies use raw drug ingredients to produce customized versions of prescription medications \u2014 for instance, when patients have allergies to certain ingredients. The industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar business over the past decade amid increasing drug shortages.",
      "Demand for off-brand GLP-1 drugs has been amplified by aggressive online promotions from telehealth companies, which aren\u2019t subject to the same marketing rules as drugmakers.",

The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",

Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",

      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",
      "First proposed in 2022, the change is a much-needed update to \u201chorribly outdated\u201d guidance, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cBig picture, this is a huge improvement from a 30-year-old outdated definition based on 40-year-old science,\u201d he said.",
      "The new rule acknowledges that dietary and nutrition knowledge has progressed over three decades and that the previous definition didn\u2019t jibe with dietary guidelines that are the cornerstone of federal programs and policies.",
      "Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group, said that the new rule \u201cstands to exclude some packaged foods, despite countless years of industry innovation to provider healthier options.\u201d",
      "Sarah Gallo, an official for the group, said it is concerned the new rule \u201cis not based on clear and unambiguous scientific evidence\u201d and doesn't fully consider the full potential economic impact on consumers.",
      "The updated criteria are based on data that could improve public health, including diet-related chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes, the FDA said.",
      "More than three-quarters of Americans have diets low in vegetables, fruit and dairy, according to the FDA. Nearly 80% exceed limits on saturated fat, more than 60% exceed limits on added sugars and about 90% exceed limits on sodium that can reduce chronic disease.",

      "California officials have declared a state of emergency over the spread of bird flu, which is tearing through dairy cows in that state and causing sporadic illnesses in people in the U.S.",
      "That raises new questions about the virus, which has spread for years in wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species.",
      "The virus, also known as Type A H5N1, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation's first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said he declared the state of emergency to better position state staff and supplies to respond to the outbreak.",
      "California has been looking for bird flu in large milk tanks during processing. And they have found the virus it at least 650 herds, representing about three-quarters of all affected U.S. dairy herds.",
      "The virus was recently detected in Southern California dairy farms after being found in the state\u2019s Central Valley since August.",
      "\u201cThis proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed again this week that the virus poses low risk to the general public.",
      "Importantly, there are no reports of person-to-person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among humans.",
      "In general, flu experts agreed with that assessment, saying it\u2019s too soon to tell what trajectory the outbreak could take.",
      "\u201cThe entirely unsatisfactory answer is going to be: I don\u2019t think we know yet,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "But virus experts are wary because flu viruses are constantly mutating and small genetic changes could change the outlook.",
      "This week, health officials confirmed the first known case of severe illness in the U.S. All previous the previous U.S. cases \u2014 there have been about 60 \u2014 were generally mild.",
      "The patient in Louisiana, who is older than 65 and had underlying medical problems, is in critical condition. Few details have been released, but officials said the person developed severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock of sick birds.",
      "That makes it the first confirmed U.S. infection tied to backyard birds, the CDC said.",
      "Tests showed that the strain that caused the person's illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.",
      "Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "It's possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cI assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said.",
      "\u201cIf birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should very careful about how they handle those animals,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a public health disease expert at the University of Minnesota.",
      "The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu \u2014 and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.",
      "In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products.",
      "In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats.",
      "Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.",

      "The Justice Department has unsealed a civil complaint alleging CVS Pharmacy Inc. and various subsidiaries filled unlawful prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act",
      "The Justice Department unsealed a civil complaint Wednesday alleging CVS Pharmacy Inc. and various subsidiaries filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act.",
      "The complaint also says CVS sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for such prescriptions in violation of the False Claims Act. CVS is the largest pharmacy chain in the U.S., where there are more than 9,000 pharmacies.",
      "A representative of CVS said the company has cooperated with the DOJ\u2019s investigation for more than four years, and strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d within the complaint.",
      "Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled from Oct. 17, 2013, to the present were for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and \u201ctrinity\u201d prescriptions \u2014 a dangerous combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant, according to prosecutors.",
      "CVS also allegedly filled large quantities of prescriptions for controlled substances written by prescribers it knew to be engaged in \u201cpill mill practices\u201d \u2014 that is, prescribers who issue large numbers of controlled substance prescriptions without any medical purpose, investigators said.",
      "According to the complaint, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists and internal data, indicating that its stores were dispensing such prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to exercise its critical role as gatekeeper of dangerous prescription opioids and, instead, facilitated the illegal proliferation of these highly addictive drugs, including by pill mill prescribers,\" U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha for the District of Rhode Island said in a press release.",
      "If CVS is found liable, it could face civil penalties for each unlawful prescription filled and treble damages and other penalties for each prescription reimbursed by federal health care programs.",
      "The company said it's cooperated with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe will defend ourselves vigorously against this misguided federal lawsuit, which follows on the heels of years of litigation over these issues by state and local governments \u2014 claims that already have been largely resolved by a global agreement with the participating state Attorneys General,\u201d said Amy Thibault, director of external communications for CVS in a written statement.",
      "Each of the prescriptions in question was for an FDA-approved opioid medication prescribed by a practitioner who the government itself licensed, authorized and empowered to write controlled-substance prescriptions, Thibault added.",
      "The filing of the complaint follows the announcement on Friday that the McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin.",
      "It\u2019s the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold companies accountable that officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of these deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 18:02:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
    "story": [
      "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients' privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials' push to reduce or eliminate such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe government has no place in surveilling Arizonans\u2019 medical decision-making or tracking their health history,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. \u201cStarting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.\u201d",
      "Hobbs is not the only one concerned about the collection of abortion data, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again, when he could implement policies that are hostile, or at least less favorable, to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:27 -0500",
    "summary": "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

      "A person in Louisiana is hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms caused by a bird flu infection, state health officials said. The person, who is over 65 and has underlying medical problems, had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.",
      "It's the first human case in the U.S. linked to exposure to backyard birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Since March, more than 60 bird flu infections in people have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "CDC officials said that bird flu is still mainly an animal health issues and that the risk to the general public remains low. There has been no documented spread of the virus from person to person, said the CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis.",
      "The Louisiana illness comes weeks after Canadian officials reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu. In both instances, the illnesses were caused by a strain of the virus found in wild birds, not in cattle, officials said.",
      "On a call with reporters, CDC officials did not answer a question about whether the new U.S. case and the Canada case had any similarities or differences.",
      "In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the state of emergency as cases of the virus were detected in dairy cows on Southern California farms. Previously, the virus had been detected in state's Central Valley.",
      "\u201cThis proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The virus has been detected in 865 dairy herds in 16 states, with nearly 650 of them in California. Raw milk from infected cattle was recalled late last month after the virus was found in samples sold in California stores.",
      "On Wednesday, Los Angeles County health officials confirmed the deaths of two cats from bird flu infections after drinking the recalled raw milk.",
      "Flu experts said the trajectory of the virus in people remains unclear, but they urged people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.",

      "Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers",
      "Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother\u2019s autopsy report.",
      "There it was, one devastating word: \u201caccident.\u201d The papers trembled in her hands.",
      "Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold\u2019s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing.",
      "How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide.",
      "Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner\u2019s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight.",
      "\u201cNo more silence or complacency,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo sweeping it under the rug.\u201d",
      "In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died \u2014 what\u2019s known as the manner and cause of death.",
      "On TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d or \u201cBones,\u201d facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.",
      "That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren\u2019t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police.",
      "Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP\u2019s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use \u2014 even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

    "story": [
      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ \u2014 and notably, she isn\u2019t as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",
      "Locke, who recently joined the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, visited last week to check her longtime patient's progress. Looney hugged her, saying, \u201cThank you for not giving up on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever,\u201d Locke responded.",

      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",

He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",

So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",

      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",

      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",
      "Besser, in an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, said Kennedy stands out as a \u201csingle potential Cabinet member who could do the most damage to the American people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",

      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

The federal government foots 90% of the expansion costs under the program.",
      "In just the first few weeks of the program's rollout, the state had 300,000 North Carolinians \u2014 half of its goal \u2014 enroll in Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is part of a handful of Southern states that now participate in the program.",
      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tens of thousands streamed into a central square in Serbia's capital on Sunday for a big rally against populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government, whose tight grip on power has been challenged by weeks of street protests led by university students.",
      "The rally at Belgrade's Slavija Square, one of the largest in recent years, was called by students and farmer unions. It was part of a wider movement demanding accountability over the Nov. 1 collapse of a canopy at a railway station in the country's north that killed 15 people.",
      "Smaller rallies were also held in the cities of Nis and Kragujevac. The rally in Belgrade started with a 15-minute silence for the victims, and later chants of \u201cYou have blood on your hands!\u201d were heard.",
      "Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad that was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Protesters demand that Vucic and those responsible face justice.",
      "Serbia's popular theater and movie actors joined the protest, with actor Bane Trifunovic describing Sunday\u2019s rally as \u201ca festival of freedom.\u201d",
      "In a show of confidence, the Serbian president on Sunday inaugurated a section of a newly built highway in central Serbia. Vucic said he wouldn't budge to opposition demands for a transitional government and accused his opponents of using students to try to seize power.",
      "\u201cWe will beat them again,\u201d said Vucic.\u201cThey (the opposition) don't know what to do but to use someone's children.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation.",
      "The weekslong protests reflect wider discontent with Vucic's rule. The populist leader formally says he wants to take Serbia into the European Union but has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them.",
      "Opposition parties have said a transitional government that would prepare a free and fair election could be a way out of the political tensions as ruling populists also have been accused of rigging past votes.",
      "Serbia\u2019s government has extended school winter holidays by starting them nearly a week earlier to grapple with widening student protests.",
      "Classes at universities throughout the Balkan country have been suspended for weeks with students camping inside their faculty buildings. In recent days, more high school students have joined the movement. Occasional violence has erupted when pro-government thugs tried to disrupt the protests.",
      "A group of farmers said Sunday that police took away the tractor which they drove into central Belgrade ahead of the protest. In addition to the farmers, Serbia\u2019s students also have received nationwide support from all walks of life including their professors, media personalities, lawyers and prominent individuals.",
      "Vucic initially accused the students of launching protests for money but later said he has fulfilled their demands, including publishing documentation relating to the renovation work at the Novi Sad station.",

      "Spaniards have been anticipating the arrival of \u201cEl Gordo\u201d or \u201cThe Fat One\u201d for weeks",
      "MADRID -- For weeks, Spaniards had anticipated the arrival of \u201cEl Gordo\u201d or \"The Fat One.\"",
      "But unlike Santa Claus, El Gordo arrived three days before Christmas, before noon on Sunday.",
      "El Gordo is the first prize of Spain\u2019s hugely popular national Christmas lottery, which is said to be the world\u2019s largest based on the total prize money involved, even though other lotteries have larger single prizes. This year's draw will spread riches totaling 2.7 billion euros (around $2.8 billion), much of it in small winnings.",
      "Several ticket holders with the number 72480 won the top prize, worth 400,000 euros (roughly $417,000) before taxes. The winning tickets were sold in Logro\u00f1o, a city in northern Spain's La Rioja region that is known for its wines.",
      "Multiple tickets with the same number can be sold to different groups and full tickets are divisible into 10 parts. Buying and sharing these fractions, known in Spanish as \u201cd\u00e9cimos\u201d or tenths, is a popular tradition in the run-up to Christmas. Families, friends, and co-workers often take part, usually spending 20 euros (about $21) each.",
      "On Sunday, young students from Madrid's San Ildefonso school selected the numbers from two revolving orbs in the capital's Teatro Real opera house and sang them out in turn for nearly five hours in a cadence familiar to Spaniards. After \u201cEl Gordo\u201d was announced, audience members \u2014 some dressed in costume as Don Quijote, Christmas elves, Biblical wise men and the lottery itself \u2014 began streaming out of the venue, from which the event was televised nationally.",
      "Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles, a teacher from the southwestern province of Badajoz, said she waited for hours in line to get a seat inside the opera house to watch the event with a group of 14 friends and family members that she traveled with to Madrid.",
      "\u201cThe point of coming to see the lottery is the hope,\" \u00c1ngeles said. She reckoned no one in her group won more than 140 euros ($146).",
      "The lottery works on the premise of distributing the most winning numbers to the largest number of people possible. There are hundreds of small prizes and 13 major ones, including the \u201cEl Gordo\u201d winner.",
      "In the weeks leading up to the draw, lines form outside lottery offices, especially those with a history of selling prize-winning tickets in previous years.",
      "Spain\u2019s Dec. 22 Christmas lottery began during the Napoleonic wars in 1812 and has continued largely without interruption since then, even during the Spanish Civil War. Students from the San Ildefonso school have been singing the prizes since the start.",
      "Spain\u2019s national lottery was first established as a charity in 1763 by the Bourbon monarch King Carlos III. It was later used to shore up state coffers. Today, it supports various charities.",

      "MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte -- Cyclone Chido not only ravaged Mayotte\u2019s fragile infrastructure but also laid bare deep-seated tensions between the island\u2019s residents and its large migrant population.",
      "Thousands of people who have entered the island illegally bore the brunt of the storm that tore through the Indian Ocean archipelago. Authorities in Mayotte, France's poorest territory, said many avoided emergency shelters out of fear of deportation, leaving them, and the shantytowns they live in, even more vulnerable to the cyclone\u2019s devastation.",
      "Still, some frustrated legal residents have accused the government of channeling scarce resources to migrants at their expense.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. Just to have water is complicated,\u201d said Fatima on Saturday, a 46-year-old mother of five whose family has struggled to find clean water since the storm.",
      "Fatima, who only gave her first name because her family is known locally, added that \u201cthe island can\u2019t support the people living in it, let alone allow more to come.\u201d",
      "Mayotte, a French department located between Madagascar and mainland Africa, has a population of 320,000, including an estimated 100,000 migrants, most of whom have arrived from the nearby Comoros Islands, just 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.",
      "The archipelago's fragile public services, designed for a much smaller population, have been overwhelmed.",
      "\u201cThe problems of Mayotte cannot be solved without addressing illegal immigration,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said during his visit this week, acknowledging the challenges posed by the island\u2019s rapid population growth,",
      "\u201cDespite the state\u2019s investments, migratory pressure has made everything explode,\u201d he added.",
      "The cyclone further exacerbated the island\u2019s issues after destroying homes, schools, and infrastructure.",
      "Though the official death toll remains 35, authorities say that any estimates are likely major undercounts, with hundreds and possibly thousands feared dead. Meanwhile, the number of seriously injured has risen to 78.",
      "The migrants' shantytowns, known as \"bangas,\" have long been an issue in Mayotte.",
      "\u201cCan we solve the issue of shantytowns today? The answer is no. We will address it during the stabilization and rebuilding phase,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Most migrants have family links in Mayotte and speak the same language. They seek a better life on the island rather than aiming to reach the European continent.",
      "For many like Nazca Antoiy, a Comorian who has lived in Mayotte for a decade, the cyclone has stoked fears of displacement.",
      "\u201cI heard that people were told not to reconstruct new houses. So we need to worry about that,\u201d she said.",
      "These fears are not unfounded. Last year, France launched Operation Wuambushu, a controversial campaign to demolish shantytowns and deport undocumented migrants. Macron hinted that similar policies could resume but stressed reconstruction efforts would take precedence.",
      "Mayotte\u2019s geopolitical position has long made it a hotspot for migration. While the island voted to remain French in referendums held in 1974 and 1976, neighboring Comoros has never recognized its sovereignty and continues to claim the archipelago as its own. This unresolved dispute has fueled waves of migration, with thousands risking perilous sea crossings each year.",
      "Outgoing French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently reignited the debate, describing the situation in Mayotte as a \u201cwar,\u201d earlier this week. Retailleau proposed stricter measures, including using drones and naval patrols to block further arrivals. \u201cWe must be much tougher on the Comoros,\u201d he said, accusing the neighboring government of allowing migrants to leave its shores unchecked.",
      "Retailleau\u2019s calls to \u201cchange the rules\u201d include proposals to restrict birthright citizenship in Mayotte, a policy already tightened in 2018 to require proof that at least one parent had been a legal resident for more than three months. Critics argue that these measures only deepen Mayotte\u2019s divisions without addressing the root causes of migration.",
      "A 2023 parliamentary report cited in French media warned that the island was a \u201cticking time bomb\" while suggesting redistributing part of Mayotte\u2019s migrant population to mainland France \u2014 a proposal unlikely to gain widespread support.",

      "BEIJING -- The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called \u201cdangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d",
      "Taiwan is a democratic island of 23 million people that the Chinese government claims as its territory and says must come under its control. U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack.",
      "The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a social media post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's \u201ccommitment to our defense.\u201d",

      "Nearly two million displaced Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to protect themselves from the coming winter",
      "KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 14-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.",
      "There is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, little wood for fires, and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use, according to aid workers and residents.",
      "Shadia Aiyada, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to the coastal area of Muwasi, has only one blanket and a hot water bottle to keep her eight children from shivering inside their fragile tent.",
      "\u201cWe get scared every time we learn from the weather forecast that rainy and windy days are coming up because our tents are lifted with the wind. We fear that strong windy weather would knock out our tents one day while we\u2019re inside,\u201d she said.",
      "With nighttime temperatures that can drop into the 40s (the mid-to-high single digits Celsius), Aiyada fears that her kids will get sick without warm clothing.",
      "When they fled their home, her children only had their summer clothes, she said. They have been forced to borrow some from relatives and friends to keep warm.",
      "The United Nations warns of people living in precarious makeshift shelters that might not survive the winter. At least 945,000 people need winterization supplies, which have become prohibitively expensive in Gaza, the U.N. said in an update Tuesday. The U.N. also fears infectious disease, which spiked last winter, will climb again amid rising malnutrition.",
      "The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, known as UNRWA, has been planning all year for winter in Gaza, but the aid it was able to get into the territory is \u201cnot even close to being enough for people,\u201d said Louise Wateridge, an agency spokeswoman.",
      "UNRWA distributed 6,000 tents over the past four weeks in northern Gaza but was unable to get them to other parts of the Strip, including areas where there has been fighting. About 22,000 tents have been stuck in Jordan and 600,000 blankets and 33 truckloads of mattresses have been sitting in Egypt since the summer because the agency doesn\u2019t have Israeli approval or a safe route to bring them into Gaza and because it had to prioritize desperately needed food aid, Wateridge said.",
      "Many of the mattresses and blankets have since been looted or destroyed by the weather and rodents, she said.",
      "The International Rescue Committee is struggling to bring in children\u2019s winter clothing because there \u201care a lot of approvals to get from relevant authorities,\u201d said Dionne Wong, the organization\u2019s deputy director of programs for the occupied Palestinian territories.",
      "\u201cThe ability for Palestinians to prepare for winter is essentially very limited,\u201d Wong said.",
      "The Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating aid shipments into Gaza said in a statement that Israel has worked for months with international organizations to prepare Gaza for the winter, including facilitating the shipment of heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets into the territory.",
      "More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it has said more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war was sparked by Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, where the militant group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in Gaza.",
      "Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal, which would include a surge in aid into the territory.",
      "For now, the winter clothing for sale in Gaza's markets is far too expensive for most people to afford, residents and aid workers said.",
      "Reda Abu Zarada, 50, who was displaced from northern Gaza with her family, said the adults sleep with the children in their arms to keep them warm inside their tent.",
      "\u201cRats walk on us at night because we don\u2019t have doors and tents are torn. The blankets don\u2019t keep us warm. We feel frost coming out from the ground. We wake up freezing in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m scared of waking up one day to find one of the children frozen to death.\u201d",
      "On Thursday night, she fought through knee pain exacerbated by cold weather to fry zucchini over a fire made of paper and cardboard scraps outside their tent. She hoped the small meal would warm the children before bed.",
      "Omar Shabet, who is displaced from Gaza City and staying with his three children, feared that lighting a fire outside his tent would make his family a target for Israeli warplanes.",
      "\u201cWe go inside our tents after sunset and don\u2019t go out because it is very cold and it gets colder by midnight,\u201d he said. \u201cMy 7-year-old daughter almost cries at night because of how cold she is.\u201d",

      "QARDAHA, Syria -- On the walls of the palatial mausoleum built to house the remains of former Syrian President Hafez Assad, vandals have sprayed variations of the phrase, \u201cDamn your soul, Hafez.\u201d",
      "Nearly two weeks after the ouster of his son, Bashar Assad, people streamed in to take photos next to the burned-out hollow where the elder Assad\u2019s grave used to be. It was torched by rebel fighters after a lightning offensive overthrew Assad's government, bringing more than a half-century rule by the Assad dynasty to an end.",
      "The mausoleum's sprawling grounds \u2014 and the surrounding area, where the ousted president and other relatives had villas \u2014 were until recently off limits to residents of Qardaha, the former presidential dynasty's hometown in the mountains overlooking the coastal city of Latakia.",
      "Nearby, Bashar Assad\u2019s house was emptied by looters, who left the water taps running to flood it. At a villa belonging to three of his cousins, a father and his two young sons were removing pipes to sell the scrap metal. A gutted piano was tipped over on the floor.",
      "While the Assads lived in luxury, most Qardaha residents \u2014 many, like Assad, members of the Alawite minority sect \u2014 survived on manual labor, low-level civil service jobs and farming to eke out a living. Many sent their sons to serve in the army, not out of loyalty to the government but because they had no other option.",
      "\u201cThe situation was not what the rest of the Syrian society thought,\u201d said Deeb Dayoub, an Alawite sheikh. \u201cEveryone thought Qardaha was a city built on a marble rock and a square of aquamarine in every house,\" he said, referring to the trappings of wealth enjoyed by Assad's family.",
      "In the city\u2019s main street, a modest strip of small grocery stores and clothing shops, Ali Youssef, stood next to a coffee cart, gesturing with disdain. \u201cThis street is the best market and the best street in Qardaha and it\u2019s full of potholes.\u201d",
      "Families resorted to eating bread dipped in oil and salt because they could not afford meat or vegetables, he said. Youssef said he dodged mandatory military service for two years, but eventually was forced to go.",
      "\u201cOur salary was 300,000 Syrian pounds,\u201d a month, he said \u2014 just over $20. \u201cWe used to send it to our families to pay the rent or live and eat with it\" while working jobs on the side to cover their own expenses.",
      "\"Very few people benefited from the former deposed regime,\u201d Youssef said.",
      "So far, residents said, the security forces made up of fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 the main group in the coalition that unseated Assad, and which is now ruling the country \u2014 have been respectful toward them.",
      "\u201cThe security situation is fine so far, it\u2019s acceptable, no major issues,\u201d said Mariam al-Ali, who was in the market with her daughter. \u201cThere were a few abuses \u2026 but it was fixed.\u201d She did not elaborate, but others said there had been scattered incidents of robberies and looting or threats and insults.",
      "Al-Ali called Assad a \u201ctraitor,\u201d but she remained circumspect about her Alawite community's position in the new Syria.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is that there should be no sectarianism, so there will be no more blood spilled,\u201d she said.",
      "Dayoub, the Alawite sheikh, described \u201ca state of anticipation and caution among all citizens in this area, and in general among Alawites,\u201d although he said fears have started to ease.",
      "At the town\u2019s municipal building, dozens of notables sat on bleachers discussing the country' s new reality and what they hoped to convey to the new leadership.",
      "Much was centered around economic woes \u2014 retired public servants' salaries had not been paid, the price of fuel had risen, there was no public transportation in the area.",
      "But others had larger concerns.",
      "\u201cWe hope that in the next government or the new Syria, we will have rights and duties like any Syrian citizen \u2014 we are not asking for any more or less,\u201d said Jaafar Ahmed, a doctoral student and community activist. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the curtailment of our rights because the regime was part of this component.\u201d",
      "Questions also loomed about the fate of the area's sons who had served in Assad's army.",
      "Since the army's collapse in the face of the rebel advance, residents said several thousand young army recruits from Qardaha have gone missing. Some later turned up on lists of former soldiers being held at a detention center in Hama.",
      "\u201cThese are young guys who are 22 or 23 and they never took part\" in active combat, said Qais Ibrahim, whose nephews were among the missing. Over the past few years, active combat was largely frozen in the country's civil war. \u201cWe send our children to the army because we don\u2019t have any other source of income.\u201d",
      "Um Jaafar, who gave only her nickname out of fear of reprisals, said the family had no information about the fate of her two sons, stationed with the army in Raqqa and Deir Ezzour, though one son's name later turned up on the list of those imprisoned in Hama.",
      "\u201cMy children got the best grades in school, but I didn\u2019t have the ability to send them to the university,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went to the army just for a salary that was barely enough to cover their transportation costs.\u201d",
      "Syria's new authorities have set up \u201creconciliation centers\u201d around the country where former soldiers can register, hand over their weapons and receive a \u201creconciliation ID\u201d allowing them to move freely and safely in Syria for three months.",
      "But Ahmed, the doctoral student, said he wants more. As the country attempts to unify and move on after nearly 14 years of civil war, he said, \u201cWe want either forgiveness for all or accountability for all.\u201d",
      "Ahmed acknowledged that during the war, \u201crural Latakia was responsible for some radical groups,\u201d referring to pro-Assad militias accused of widespread abuses against civilians. But, he said, opposition groups also committed abuses.",
      "Rebels often indiscriminately targeted Alawites because they were seen as the firmest pillar of Assad\u2019s rule \u2014 and some Islamist extremists among the rebels consider them heretics.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be either an open process of reconciliation ... or transitional justice in which all will be held accountable for their mistakes, from all parties,\" he said.",

      "AYOD, South Sudan -- Long-horned cattle wade through flooded lands and climb a slope along a canal that has become a refuge for displaced families in South Sudan. Smoke from burning dung rises near homes of mud and grass where thousands of people now live after floods swept away their village.",
      "\u201cToo much suffering,\u201d said Bichiok Hoth Chuiny, a woman in her 70s. She supported herself with a stick as she walked in the newly established community of Pajiek in Jonglei state north of the capital, Juba.",
      "For the first time in decades, the flooding had forced her to flee. Her efforts to protect her home by building dykes failed. Her former village of Gorwai is now a swamp.",
      "\u201cI had to be dragged in a canoe up to here,\u201d Chuiny said. An AP journalist was the first to visit the community.",
      "Such flooding is becoming a yearly disaster in South Sudan, which the World Bank has described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most vulnerable country to climate change and also the one most lacking in coping capacity.\"",
      "More than 379,000 people have been displaced by flooding this year, according to the U.N humanitarian agency.",
      "Seasonal flooding has long been part of the lifestyle of pastoral communities around the Sudd, the largest wetlands in Africa, in the Nile River floodplain. But since the 1960s the swamp has kept growing, submerging villages, ruining farmland and killing livestock.",
      "\u201cThe Dinka, Nuer and Murle communities of Jonglei are losing the ability to keep cattle and do farming in that region the way they used to,\u201d said Daniel Akech Thiong, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.",
      "South Sudan is poorly equipped to adjust. Independent since 2011, the country plunged into civil war in 2013. Despite a peace deal in 2018, the government has failed to address numerous crises. Some 2.4 million people remain internally displaced by conflict and flooding.",
      "The latest overflowing of the Nile has been blamed on factors including the opening of dams upstream in Uganda after Lake Victoria rose to its highest levels in five years.",
      "The century-old Jonglei Canal, which was never completed, has become a refuge for many.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know up to where this flooding would have pushed us if the canal was not there,\u201d said Peter Kuach Gatchang, the paramount chief of Pajiek. He was already raising a small garden of pumpkins and eggplants in his new home.",
      "The 340-kilometer (211-mile) Jonglei Canal was first imagined in the early 1900s by Anglo-Egyptian colonial authorities to increase the Nile\u2019s outflow towards Egypt in the north. But its development was interrupted by the long fight of southern Sudanese against the Sudanese regime in Khartoum that eventually led to the creation of a separate country.",
      "Gatchang said the new community in Pajiek is neglected: \"We have no school and no clinic here, and if you stay for a few days, you will see us carrying our patients on stretchers up to Ayod town.\u201d",
      "Ayod, the county headquarters, is reached by a six-hour walk through the waist-high water.",
      "Pajiek also has no mobile network and no government presence. The area is under the control of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition, founded by President Salva Kiir\u2019s rival turned Vice President Riek Machar.",
      "Villagers rely on aid. On a recent day, hundreds of women lined up in a nearby field to receive some from the World Food Program.",
      "Nyabuot Reat Kuor walked home with a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of sorghum balanced on her head.",
      "\u201cThis flooding has destroyed our farm, killed our livestock and displaced us for good,\" the mother of eight said. \u201cOur old village of Gorwai has become a river.\u201d",
      "When food assistance runs out, she said, they will survive on wild leaves and water lilies from the swamp. Already in recent years, food aid rations have been cut in half as international funding for such crises drops.",
      "More than 69,000 people who have migrated to the Jonglei Canal in Ayod county are registered for food assistance, according to WFP.",
      "\u201cThere are no passable roads at this time of the year, and the canal is too low to support boats carrying a lot of food,\u201d said John Kimemia, a WFP airdrop coordinator.",
      "In the neighboring Paguong village that is surrounded by flooded lands, the health center has few supplies. Medics haven\u2019t been paid since June due to an economic crisis that has seen civil servants nationwide go unpaid for more than a year.",
      "South Sudan\u2019s economic woes have deepened with the disruption of oil exports after a major pipeline was damaged in Sudan during that country's ongoing civil war.",
      "\u201cThe last time we got drugs was in September. We mobilized the women to carry them on foot from Ayod town,\u201d said Juong Dok Tut, a clinical officer.",
      "Patients, mostly women and children, sat on the ground as they waited to see the doctor. Panic rippled through the group when a thin green snake passed among them. It wasn't poisonous, but many others in the area are. People who venture into the water to fish or collect water lilies are at risk.",
      "Four life-threatening snake bites cases occurred in October, Tut said. \u201cWe managed these cases with the antivenom treatments we had, but now they\u2019re over, so we don\u2019t know what to do if it happens again.\u201d",

      "Both pilots were recovered alive, with one suffering minor injuries.",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels.",
      "Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.",
      "The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea.",
      "\u201cThe guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,\u201d Central Command said in a statement.",
      "From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the \u201cRed Rippers\u201d of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication.",
      "However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past.",
      "Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II.",
      "On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a \u201cmissile storage facility\u201d and a \u201ccommand-and-control facility,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis did not acknowledge the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea.",
      "The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.",

      "SURIN ISLANDS, Thailand -- When Hook was a child, he started his days by jumping off the boat that his family lived on and into the ocean. By age 3, he could already swim and dive in shallow waters. His home was a kabang, a boat, that his family sailed in Thailand\u2019s southern waters. The ocean was his backyard.",
      "Now Hook, whose full name is Suriyan Klathale, lives on land like the rest of his community, a people known as the Moken. The recollections of his childhood, which many Moken of his generation still have, are mostly just memories.",
      "The community, a group of indigenous people from Thailand and Myanmar, came to worldwide attention for its members' understanding of waves when the Indian Ocean Tsunami struck in December 2004 and killed more than 200,000 people. The few tourists who happened to be on the islands inhabited by the Moken survived because locals knew when they saw the water recede that people needed to get to higher ground.",
      "Today, things are different and changing fast. This once free-sailing people have been grounded by powerful forces of change.",
      "The Moken are one of the various tribal groups and indigenous communities not formally recognized by the Thai government. For years, activists from these communities have tried to push for formal recognition with a bill that would help them hold on to traditions.",
      "But as recently as October, the latest draft of this proposed bill, called the Protection and Promotion of Ethnic Groups\u2019 Way of Life, was tabled by Parliament. The bill would legally guarantee these communities' basic rights, such as health care, education and land, as well as provide government support to preserve their ethnic identities.",
      "For the Moken, the kabang and their way of living on the ocean are something they hope the law could help preserve. The wooden boat, with a distinctive curve that juts out from its bow and a pavilion set in the middle, is central to the Moken\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s like a lifetime of a person, of a family,\" Hook said. \u201cIn the past, we lived and died on that boat.\u201d",
      "Multiple generations could live on a kabang, which were much bigger in the past. The parents would stay in the middle of the boat; their married children lived at the front until they built their own boat.",
      "Tat, an elder in the Moken community who uses only one name, said that a Moken became an adult when he could build a boat. It meant he was capable of starting a family.",
      "Today, though, almost no one lives on a boat. Narumon Arunotai, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who has worked with the Moken and other indigenous communities for decades, said the shift toward permanent dwelling on land had already started more than 40 years ago.",
      "It was a gradual shift, driven both by stricter border controls as well as the inability to get the wood necessary to build the kabangs. Further, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 destroyed many of the traditional boats. The change to dwelling on land has happened with other communities known colloquially as sea nomads in Thailand as well.",
      "The Moken are scattered across an archipelago of some 800 islands on the coast of Myanmar and Thailand. In the days when they lived on boats, Moken stayed on land only during the monsoon season, which started around May. They\u2019d stay on land until the winds shifted, usually around December, and then abandon their temporary homes for the sea. For food, they fished and foraged.",
      "Many of the older generation were born on boats and sailed regularly amongst the islands.",
      "\u201cWe could move freely without having to worry about the Myanmar government or the Thai government,\" said Tawan Klathale, Hook\u2019s older brother, who was born on a boat. All Moken in Thailand use the surname Klathale, given to the community by one of Thailand\u2019s former queens.",
      "\u201cBack then,\" said the brother, who is known as Ngui, \u201cthere was no clear line to where is Myanmar and where is Thailand.\u201d",
      "But by the time Ngui and Hook were teenagers, they could no longer travel as freely between those islands. Many Moken started settling more permanently in the Surin Islands, off the Thai coast. Some came from Myanmar to Thailand, looking for jobs and safety from pirates. Hook\u2019s family stayed ashore.",
      "The parts of the community that stayed in Thailand found that the land they had always visited each season had become a national park by 1981. As a result, they could no longer cut down the large trees they needed to build their boats.",
      "To make a kabang, one needs a good strong tree, at least 1 meter wide and 10 meters tall. The trunk needs to be straight and be free of defects. Over the course of months, men of the community would dig out the trunk and carve it into a boat\u2019s hull, while also using fire to make the wood pliable and stretch it out. It was a communal thing, involving up to 10 people.",
      "Now, it\u2019s difficult to gather enough people. Other men of the village would often be out working during the day. They did not have time to join and work together on a boat.",
      "Ngui and other members of an informal group called Moken Pa Ti\u2019ao, concerned they were losing the knowledge of boat-building, said they approached the park now and then across the years get a tree to make the boat. They were refused years ago by the chief of Mu Ko Surin National Park. The group hasn\u2019t asked since.",
      "The park allows them to cut down only small trees, said Ngui, who is also assistant to the village chief in Surin Island. \u201cThe restrictions has been like this as far as we can remember.\u201d",
      "Today, the village in Surin only has one kabang, built by Tat and used mostly to ferry tourists and take children out on day trips. Hook, who lives on the mainland in Thailand, also has a kabang built with the funding of a private donor from Norway after a filmmaker made a documentary about his journey to make one such boat in 2014. But his kabang is built with planks of wood, rather than a single hollowed out tree.",
      "They are among the few keen to remember the boats and other traditions. Tat says he has made sure to pass down what he knew to his children, from songs to boat building.",
      "\u201cIf my generation is gone, there would be just very few people left who know how to do these things,\u201d Tat said.",
      "Together, Tat and Wilasinee Klathale, a teacher at the school on the island, also try to take village children out on the boats to teach them about the ocean as well as about music and dance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in the curriculum, but I added them myself, because I could see that these things are going to be lost,\u201d Wilasinee said.",
      "Today, young Moken are more worried about their livelihoods and finding jobs than how to build a boat. Most only make money during Thailand\u2019s peak tourist season when the national park is open to tourists, from November to April, and have to live on that money for the rest of the year.",
      "Boyen Klathale, a young Moken man, said it\u2019s difficult to find a job. On Surin, the opportunities are either with the national park or operating boats to take tourists out. Though it\u2019s peak season, he wasn\u2019t able to find a job this year, and he didn\u2019t want to leave behind his family to find work on the mainland.",
      "The Moken have asked for more fishing rights in the past, but were denied a further quota beyond the subsistence amount they\u2019re allowed from the park. Ngui, the village chief\u2019s assistant, said he hopes the Moken can sell the souvenirs they make to tourists all year around with help from the government.",
      "The future holds some hope. In 2024, the Surin Islands National Park appointed a new chief, Kriengkrai Pohcharoen. In a shift, he said he was open to collaborating with the Moken on a kabang \u2014 as long as it was a tree that fell over on its own.",
      "\u201cI think about how to improve their quality of life, and how they can sustainably live in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to have a good quality of life.\u201d",
      "The Moken are realistic about their permanent switch to land. These days, most prefer it. But some still remember the old ways \u2014 and an aquamarine bay filled with handmade kabangs.",
      "\u201cThe world is changing and that\u2019s the way it is, if you ask me,\u201d Ngui said. \u201cI think everything is bound to be lost at some point, but I just want it to stay as long as possible.\""

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- As Christmas approaches and people decorate their homes with lights, Ecuadoreans are getting some relief from the severe power cuts that have hounded the country this year with President Daniel Noboa saying there will be no power rationing for residential areas - for the time being.",
      "But some of the country\u2019s largest mines, cement factories and steel mills will not be so lucky, facing continued power rationing in the last two weeks of December, according to Ecuador\u2019s Ministry of Energy. And there are no assurances the rationing will stop next year.",
      "This discrepancy between residential and industrial areas has raised concerns in Ecuador\u2019s business community over the future of the economy. Companies in the South American nation are losing an estimated $700 million each week from daily power cuts, according to the chamber of commerce in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city.",
      "Ecuador\u2019s latest power rationing scheme, which began on Dec. 20, has also prompted some analysts to question whether President Noboa is using the nation\u2019s scarce supply of electricity for political ends.",
      "Ecuador will hold presidential elections in February and Noboa, a conservative who has promised to fix the nation\u2019s electricity crisis and tackle its growing problem with drug gangs, is planning to run for reelection.",
      "The 37-year-old was voted into office i n a snap election at the end of last year after his predecessor was forced to dissolve congress amid a corruption probe, and end his term prematurely.",
      "\u201cNoboa wants to stop people from being frustrated, or angry with the government,\u201d said Hernan Reyes a political scientist at the Universidad Andina in the capital Quito.",
      "For Esteban Ron, the dean of social sciences at Quito\u2019s SEK University, Noboa\u2019s decision to suspend power cuts in residential areas is part of an effort by the president to \u201credeem\u201d himself with Ecuadorean voters and \u201cshow that he is fighting for the people.\u201d",
      "Ecuador since the end of last year has been struggling with power cuts that the goverment attributes to mismanagement of power plants and a dry spell caused by the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "The nation of 15 million people invested heavily in hydroelectric power over the past two decades as it looked to promote cheap and renewable energy sources. But it has few alternatives to the electricity generated at its dams, which produce between 70% to 90% of Ecuador\u2019s monthly power supply",
      "As rain in Ecuador dropped to its lowest levels in 60 years this summer, the government was forced to implement power cuts in many cities lasting up to 14 hours a day.",
      "But last week the Noboa administration said in a statement that weather conditions have been improving and that maintenance problems at some of Ecuador\u2019s hydroelectric plants have been fixed. Ecuador\u2019s government also said a deal had been made to import electricity from neighboring Colombia, eliminating the need for power cuts in residential areas.",
      "Business leaders in Ecuador remain concerned over the continuing cuts at industrial sites and question whether it is wise to prioritize residential areas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sacrifice production and employment in order to make promises (to residential areas) that may not last,\u201d said Patricio Alarcon, the former president of Quito\u2019s chamber of commerce.",
      "Marco Acu\u00f1a, the president of Ecuador\u2019s national guild of engineers, said power cuts could return to residential areas after the holidays because Ecuador still has not substantially diversified its sources of energy.",
      "Acu\u00f1a said power plants using fossil fuels in Ecuador are currently producing less than 40% of the electricity they are designed to generate due to problems with engines and machines. He said the recent agreement to import electricity from Colombia will only cover about 8% of Ecuador's daily needs.",
      "In the meantime, the citizens of Ecuador are enjoying their respite from the daily power cuts.",
      "\u201cI hope people come to buy things with the same enthusiasm as before\u201d said Pablo Parra, a street vendor who sells Christmas trees and lights in Quito."

      "The Holy See\u2019s saint-making office on Dec. 17 established a historical commission, made up of experts in Belgian history and archives, to begin investigating the life and virtues of King Baudouin, the Vatican said in a communique Saturday.",
      "Francis surprised and even enraged some Belgians when, during his September visit to Brussels, he prayed at Baudouin\u2019s tomb, denounced Belgium\u2019s abortion laws as \u201chomicidal\u201d and announced he wanted to beatify the late king.",

Fortunately, the time when the church dictated the law in our country is long behind us.\u201d",
      "Francis has strongly backed the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to abortion and long equated it to murder or \u201chiring a hitman to solve a problem.\u201d But his strong comments about abortion in Belgium only served to inflame an already troubled visit, given the Belgian church's wretched legacy of clergy sexual abuse.",

      "The Vatican\u2019s saint-making process usually takes years, decades or even centuries and typically begins when the local church ascertains an enduring reputation for sanctity among the faithful by a particular candidate.",
      "An investigation into the life and virtues of the candidate follows, during which historians collect documentation and interview acquaintances and experts. If historians determine the candidate has lived a heroic life of Christian virtue, he or she can be declared venerable. The Vatican must then ascertain a miracle attributed to the candidate\u2019s intercession for beatification, and a second miracle for the person to be declared a saint.",
      "Martyrs are exempt from the miracle for beatification, and popes can bypass the process altogether and declare saints, as Francis has done on several occasions.",
      "The convening of a historical commission suggests that church historians at the very least will conduct the research into Baudouin's life. But the Vatican communique noted that the cause wasn't originating as it normally would with the local Belgian church. Rather, the Holy See's secretariat of state directed the Vatican's saint-making office to open the process, suggesting Francis may be seeking to keep close tabs on the process and see it through quickly.",

People who missed one of the COVID stimulus payments or had received less than the full amount were able to claim the credit. But the IRS on Friday said it discovered many eligible taxpayers hadn't done so.",

      "Eligible taxpayers don't have to take any action. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January 2025. They'll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.",
      "Payments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. The seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately \u2014 and frequently capped by a dome.",
      "Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.",
      "The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.",
      "They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.",

      "On a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done \u2014 going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one.",
      "Gill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee.",
      "She's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time.",
      "Why?",
      "\u201cMy dad was a clock collector growing up,\u201d Gill said. \u201cAnd every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy \u2014 a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe.",
      "Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.",
      "\u201cThe clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,\u201d said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. \u201cThe mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.\u201d",
      "Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.",
      "Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.",
      "While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.",

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Johnny Zuagar says he\u2019s tried to hide his worries about a potential government shutdown from his three boys as he weighs how much to spend on Christmas presents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to keep a poker face,\u201d Zuagar, a statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, said when thinking about his boys, ages 14, 12 and 6. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to take that worry off of your family.\u201d",
      "Like thousands of federal workers, Zuagar is navigating the holidays with the spirit of the season overtaken by an air of gloom and uncertainty.",
      "The turbulent efforts in Congress to reach an agreement on funding the federal government have cast a cloud over the holidays for many federal workers facing possible furloughs in the days before Christmas. The House on Friday passed a three-month government spending bill just hours before a government shutdown, but its fate in the Senate was uncertain as the deadline loomed.",
      "Many federal workers were already anxious about the possibility of future workforce reductions under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Zuagar, who is president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782, which represents federal workers at the census, has lived through unexpected shutdowns before \u2014 including right before the holidays.",
      "This time, it comes on the heels of promises from Trump and his allies that there will be sweeping cuts in the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cWe really don\u2019t know anymore,\" Zuagar said during a telephone interview Friday, with hours to go before a midnight deadline to approve a spending measure to avoid furloughs. \u201cAgain, the rhetoric out there is that federal employees are the problem.\u201d",
      "The contentiousness of the current debate has left him wondering: \"Are we the scapegoat for every ill and grievance in America?\"",
      "He says federal workers are worried not just about how long a potential shutdown could last, but also about what will happen after Trump takes office.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re fearful of what\u2019s to come, like this is the beginning of something, or they don\u2019t care about us,\" Zuagar said.",
      "Jesus Soriano, president of the AFGE Local 3403 representing workers at the National Science Foundation and several other agencies, also said the budget difficulties in Congress feel different from those of previous years.",
      "\u201cI think Americans should know that history is being written as we speak,\" Soriano said in an interview in Chevy Chase, Maryland, near the state's border with the nation's capital. \"Americans need to decide what type of services the government should provide, whether we are talking about national security, the safety of our borders, the safety of our food, Social Security or others.\u201d",
      "Anxiety about furloughs from a government shutdown this time could be a prelude, Soriano said.",
      "\u201cFederal employees that we represent in the American Federation of Government Employees are scared for the jobs, given the public discourse that we are all witnessing,\" Soriano said.",
      "Mac Johnson, a retired Transportation Security Administration employee who is now an executive vice president for the union's TSA Council, said TSA employees were on \u201cpins and needles\u201d Friday afternoon.",
      "Johnson said about half the TSA's workforce was on the job during the 2018 shutdown. While TSA employees would still work at the nation's airports during a shutdown, there's a chance they would not be paid until a government funding measure is approved.",
      "That's hard to bear when many employees live paycheck to paycheck.",
      "\u201cIt is a double whammy,\" Johnson said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. \"One, you\u2019re not getting paid, and I think it\u2019s going to affect the ability of any federal agency, not only TSA. You know, once upon a time, there was job security working for the federal government, but going through all of these shutdowns does not do a lot for the confidence of those potential candidates for future government employment.\u201d",
      "Zuagar said he's more confused about the budget debate this time around than in previous years.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is just all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these different factions of people.\u201d",
      "Government shutdowns not only are demoralizing to federal workers, Soriano said, but recovery takes a long time. For individuals, savings are depleted, spending is deferred and some things that once seemed necessary are suddenly out of reach.",
      "For government agencies, a lot has to be rebuilt.",
      "\u201cSo, it is not that the shutdown disappears, and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cIt takes time and effort to put a shutdown into place. It takes even more time to address all the deficiencies created by a shutdown.\u201d",
      "Despite the anxiety, Zuagar says he's avoiding blaming anyone specifically for the turbulent negotiations. For now, he's trying to be optimistic that what he's hearing is mostly rhetoric, and support for funding federal employees and the services they provide will be there.",
      "Still, he said it's \u201cshocking\u201d to be blindsided by a crisis right before the holiday. He said he would receive his last paycheck until the impasse is resolved this weekend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your last paycheck before Christmas, so for some of us, for myself, you\u2019ve got to think: Do I spend it on Christmas gifts for my family, or do I hold some of that?\u201d Zuagar said. \"Because we\u2019ve also got to pay our bills in January. It will affect people in the sense of how they spend this weekend.\u201d",
      "That's the kind of thing he wishes lawmakers would remember as they negotiate.",

      "Big Lots said its goal would be to complete a sale by early January. According to the company's website, discounts of up to 50% were being offered on the entire assortment and it announced all stores were closing.",
      "\u201cWe all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale,\u201d said Bruce Thorn, Big Lots\u2019 president and CEO said in a statement. \u201cWhile we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the GOB process.\u201d",

      "Big Lots has said that high inflation and interest rates have hurt its business as consumers have pulled back on their home and seasonal product purchases, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue.

      "Volkswagen\u2019s employee representatives say they have reached a wage deal",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Volkswagen and its employee representatives said Friday they have reached a wage deal for 120,000 German workers that avoids plant closings and bars involuntary layoffs through 2030. The agreement includes provisions for VW to shed more than 35,000 jobs through early retirement and buyouts by 2030.",
      "The deal, reached in drawn-out bargaining sessions that stretched late into the night, is aimed at enabling the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to cope with a drop in demand in Europe, higher raw-material costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.",
      "Lagging sales in Europe mean the company has lost potential sales of 500,000 cars a year, or the output of two factories.",
      "The deal would save VW 1.5 billion euros ($1.56 billion) a year in labor costs and 4 billion euros a year by slashing manufacturing capacity by more 700,000 vehicles across its German plants through different production arrangements.",
      "That the agreement avoids wholesale plant closings underscores the role played at Volkswagen by employee representatives and the state of Lower Saxony, who together have majority on the board of directors. That gives workers and the local government unusual leverage.",
      "A top Volkswagen executive called it \u201ca good agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had three priorities in the negotiations: reducing overcapacity in German locations, reducing labor costs and bringing development costs down to a competitive level,\u201d said Thomas Schaefer, head of the company's namesake Volkswagen brand.",
      "\u201cWe reached sustainable solutions in all three areas.\u201d",
      "Thorsten Groeger, negotiator for the IG Metall union, said employees also accepted \u201cpainful concessions.\" A union statement said that the loss of bonus payments and other compensation were part of the deal but that monthly wage levels would not be touched. The company had pressed for a 10% wage cut.",
      "Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America.",
      "Though major plant closings were avoided, a factory in Dresden will cease production at the end of next year as previous planned, and a plant in Osnabrueck is to produce T-Roc SUVs only through the middle of 2027. After those dates, the company will seek other uses for Osnabrueck. Top Volkswagen employee representative Daniela Cavallo said the Dresden plant could be repurposed \u201calso in cooperation with other organizations\u201d that she didn't specify.",
      "The company said it would move production of its Golf model from its home plant at Wolfsburg to Puebla, Mexico, and reduce the assembly lines at Wolfsburg from four to two that would produce the ID.3 and CUPRA Born compact cars. Some 4,000 vehicle development jobs would be dropped at Wolfsburg."

      "For small businesses, the biggest change in the new year will be the arrival of a presumably more business-friendly administration in Washington. But there are other shifts owners should keep on their radar.",
      "Among them: changes to state-level overtime and minimum wage rules, the delayed federal FinCEN registration, taxes on payments from third-party providers like Venmo and PayPal, and anything that might affect inflation, including tariffs.",
      "The Small Business Administration is also ushering in a new leader, Trump loyalist Kelly Loeffler, assuming she\u2019s confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\u201cI think there a general sense that there is going to be obviously a pro-business administration on the regulatory side,\u201d said Karen Kerrigan, President and CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, an advocacy group. \u201cBut there could be some nuances specifically on, say, workplace or labor rules. But that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what small business owners should keep in mind in 2025.",
      "Inflation remains a wild card for 2025. Inflation has retreated from its peak of 7.2% in June 2022, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, standing at 2.3% in October. Moves by the Federal Reserve and the incoming Trump administration are likely to swing inflation one way or another.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its projection for the inflation rate for 2025 to 2.5% from a prior estimate of 2.1% issued in September. The Fed also forecast just two rate cuts for the year, down from four. Sticky inflation and high rates could mean higher costs for both consumers and businesses.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts \u2014 on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income \u2014 as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs on imports and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation.",
      "Either way, inflation is certain to remain top of mind for small business owners.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for the past two-and-a-half years is that inflation is the top concern for small business,\u201d said Tom Sullivan, vice president of small business policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thinking about 2025, there is a significant question on whether or not the incoming president\u2019s policies are going to bring inflation down.\u201d",
      "Established in 1953, the SBA has been through many different administrations. The agency offers resources to small businesses and helps administer small business and disaster recovery loans. It played a crucial role during the pandemic, helping distribute small business aid.",
      "Trump said he would nominate Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. Senator from Georgia, as the head of the SBA, pending confirmation. She replaces Isabella Casillas Guzman, who has served as the administrator since 2021. A staunch Trump loyalist, Loeffler is also co-chair of his inaugural committee.",
      "Loeffler hasn\u2019t made any statement about plans for the SBA.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any sort of dramatic change or shifts in terms lending and some of those programs, I think that will happen over time,\u201d said SBE Council's Kerrigan.",
      "While a national federal rule expanding overtime coverage to millions of Americans was blocked by a federal judge in November, several states still have an overtime threshold increase going into effect, and those aren\u2019t affected by the block.",
      "Six states are raising their threshold for overtime pay: Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, New York and Washington. For example, in Alaska, the state threshold to be exempt from overtime pay will rise from $48,796.80 in 2024 to $54,080 on July 1.",
      "\u201cEmployers will need to be aware of those thresholds and make sure that they\u2019re complying with state law if they have employees in any of those states,\u201d said Tyler Yamnik, an employment attorney and human resources consultant for HR firm Engage PEO.",
      "Meanwhile, 23 states and 65 cities and counties have minimum wage increases set to go into effect in 2025, either Jan. 1 or later in the year.",
      "Rich Kingly, CEO of Driveway King in Garwood, N.J., which renovates pathways and driveways, said he\u2019s watching the state-specific minimum wage changes.",
      "\u201cAs we operate in multiple states, staying compliant with each state\u2019s rules and regulations is an ongoing challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cAs minimum wage rates rise, it adds to the financial pressures of running a business, especially in the face of fluctuating material costs and competitive pricing.\u201d",
      "A rule that would require millions of small businesses to register with an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1 is currently temporarily blocked in court.",
      "The registration is part of the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money laundering statue passed in 2021.\u202fRegistering isn\u2019t difficult. The owners and part-owners of those businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address.",
      "But small business groups say the regulation is too onerous. If it goes into effect, small businesses that don\u2019t comply could be fined up to $10,000. Businesses with more than 20 employees and more than $5 million in sales can qualify for exemptions.",
      "Steve DiMatteo, CEO of e-commerce site Cleveland Vintage Shirts, said he had trouble tracking down information about the registration because government communication was lacking. He sought guidance from an X account that helps small businesses.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern stems from this experience -- what other rules and regulations am I going to miss because of a lack of clear communication from the government, either at the state or federal level?,\u201d he said.",
      "Another regulation that has been on small businesses' radar for several years is taxes on payments via third-party apps like PayPal, Cash App, Venmo and similar platforms.",
      "Traditionally, the threshold to report earnings from payments from third-party apps was $20,000 and 200 transactions. But the American Rescue Act drastically lowered that to $600 and over with no transaction minimum.",
      "The regulation was delayed for the past two years, but small businesses paying taxes for 2024 will now be required to pay taxes on anything over $5,000 as part of a phase-in to eventually implement the $600 reporting threshold."

      "Italy\u2019s data protection authority says it has fined OpenAI $15.6 million after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by its generative artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT",
      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT.",
      "The country\u2019s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users\u2019 personal data to train ChatGPT \u201cwithout having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users\u201d.",
      "OpenAI dubbed the decision \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and said it will appeal.",
      "\u201cWhen the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.\u201d",
      "OpenAI added, however, it remained \u201ccommitted to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Approaching a midnight deadline, the Senate is preparing to give final approval to a new plan to prevent a government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- Approaching a midnight government shutdown deadline, the Senate set up votes toward final passage late Friday of a new plan that would temporarily fund federal operations and disaster aid, but drops President-elect Donald Trump's demands for a debt limit increase into the new year.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson had insisted Congress would \u201cmeet our obligations\u201d and not allow federal operations to shutter ahead of the Christmas holiday season. But the day's outcome was uncertain after Trump doubled down on his insistence that a debt ceiling increase be included in any deal \u2014 if not, he said in an early morning post, let the closures \u201cstart now.\u201d",
      "The House approved Johnson's new bill overwhelmingly, 366-34. As the Senate worked into the night, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that senators had reached agreement that would skip past procedural hurdles and allow them to pass the funding bill \u201cbefore the midnight deadline.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a good outcome for the country, \u201d Johnson said after the House vote, adding he had spoken with Trump and the president-elect \u201cwas certainly happy about this outcome, as well.\u201d",
      "It was the third attempt from Johnson, the beleaguered House speaker, to achieve one of the basic requirements of the federal government \u2014 keeping it open. And it raised stark questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job, in the face of angry GOP colleagues, and work alongside Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who called the legislative plays from afar.",
      "President Joe Biden, who has played a less public role in the process throughout a turbulent week, was expected to quickly sign the measure into law.",
      "Trump's last-minute demand was almost an impossible ask, and Johnson had almost no choice but to work around his pressure for a debt ceiling increase. The speaker knew there wouldn\u2019t be enough support within the GOP majority to pass any funding package, since many Republican deficit hawks prefer to slash federal government and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow more debt.",
      "Instead, the Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate next year, with big plans for tax cuts and other priorities, are showing they must routinely rely on Democrats for the votes needed to keep up with the routine operations of governing.",
      "\u201cSo is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?\u201d scoffed Musk on social media ahead of the vote.",
      "The drastically slimmed-down 118-page package would fund the government at current levels through March 14 and add $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in agricultural assistance to farmers.",
      "Gone is Trump\u2019s demand to lift the debt ceiling, which GOP leaders told lawmakers would be debated as part of their tax and border packages in the new year. Republicans made a so-called handshake agreement to raise the debt limit at that time while also cutting $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 years.",
      "It\u2019s essentially the same deal that flopped the night before in a spectacular setback \u2014 opposed by most Democrats and some of the most conservative Republicans \u2014 minus Trump\u2019s debt ceiling demand.",
      "But it's far smaller than the original bipartisan accord Johnson struck with Democratic and Republican leaders \u2014 a 1,500-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected, forcing him to start over. It was stuffed with a long list of other bills \u2014 including much-derided pay raises for lawmakers \u2014 but also other measures with broad bipartisan support that now have a tougher path to becoming law.",
      "House Democrats were cool to the latest effort after Johnson reneged on the hard-fought bipartisan compromise.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said it looked like Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, was calling the shots for Trump and Republicans.",
      "\u201cWho is in charge?\u201d she asked during the debate.",
      "Still, the Democrats put up more votes than Republicans for the bill's passage. Almost three dozen conservative Republicans voted against it.",
      "\u201cThe House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy and hurting working-class Americans all across the nation,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote, referring to Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.",
      "Trump, who has not yet been sworn into office, is showing the power but also the limits of his sway with Congress, as he intervenes and orchestrates affairs from Mar-a-Lago alongside Musk, who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The incoming Trump administration vows to slash the federal budget and fire thousands of employees and is counting on Republicans for a big tax package. And Trump's not fearful of shutdowns the way lawmakers are, having sparked the longest government shutdown in history in his first term at the White House.",
      "\u201cIf there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now,\u201d Trump posted early in the morning on social media.",
      "More important for the president-elect was his demand for pushing the thorny debt ceiling debate off the table before he returns to the White House. The federal debt limit expires Jan. 1, and Trump doesn't want the first months of his new administration saddled with tough negotiations in Congress to lift the nation's borrowing capacity. Now Johnson will be on the hook to deliver.",
      "\u201cCongress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,\u201d Trump posted \u2014 increasing his demand for a new five-year debt limit increase. \"Without this, we should never make a deal.\"",
      "Government workers had already been told to prepare for a federal shutdown that would send millions of employees \u2014 and members of the military \u2014 into the holiday season without paychecks.",
      "Biden has been in discussions with Jeffries and Schumer, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \u201cRepublicans blew up this deal. They did, and they need to fix this.\u201d",
      "As the day dragged on, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stepped in to remind colleagues \u201chow harmful it is to shut the government down, and how foolish it is to bet your own side won\u2019t take the blame for it.\u201d",
      "At one point, Johnson asked House Republicans at a lunchtime meeting for a show of hands as they tried to choose the path forward.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the shutdown, but the speaker\u2019s job on the line. The speaker\u2019s election is the first vote of the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, and some Trump allies have floated Musk for speaker.",
      "Johnson said he spoke to Musk ahead of the vote Friday and they talked about the \u201cextraordinary challenges of this job.\u201d",

      "An inflation gauge that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve barely rose last month in a sign that price pressures cooled after two months of sharp gains",
      "WASHINGTON -- An inflation gauge that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve barely rose last month in a sign that price pressures cooled after two months of sharp gains.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the government showed that prices rose just 0.1% from October to November. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices also ticked up just 0.1%, after two months of outsize 0.3% gains.",
      "The milder inflation figures arrived two days after Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, rocked financial markets by revealing that they now expect to cut their key interest rate just two times in 2025, down from four in their previous estimate. Stickier inflation, Powell said, \u201cmight be the single biggest factor\u201d causing the central bank to reduce the number of rate cuts it envisions. Fewer Fed rate cuts would likely mean that mortgage rates and other consumer borrowing costs would remain elevated.",
      "Yearly inflation was 2.4% in November, up from 2.3% in October and above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. Year-over-year \u201ccore\u201d prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, were unchanged at 2.8%.",
      "Inflation, according to the measure released Friday \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 has plummeted from a peak of 7.2% in June 2022 to 2.1% in September. The Fed's tool for fighting inflation is to steadily raise borrowing costs across the economy, which tends to cool spending and growth.",
      "policymakers revised their expectation for inflation by the end of 2025 to 2.5%, unchanged from its current rate. The officials still expect core prices to fall by the end of next year, also to 2.5%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s way below where it was but we really want to see (more) progress on inflation,\u201d Powell said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cAs we think about further cuts, we\u2019re going to be looking for progress.\u201d",
      "The Fed did cut its benchmark rate Wednesday by a quarter point to about 4.3%, after its larger-than-usual half-point rate cut in September and a quarter-point reduction in November.",
      "The Fed tends to favor the PCE index over the better-known consumer price index. The PCE index tries to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. It can capture, for example, when consumers switch from pricier national brands to cheaper store brands.",
      "In general, the PCE index tends to show a lower inflation rate than CPI. In part, that\u2019s because rents, which have been high, carry double the weight in the CPI.",

      "Crowds in Mayotte have vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing",
      "MIRERENI, Mayotte -- Crowds in Mayotte vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing, as he toured destruction wrought by the strongest cyclone to hit the French territory in nearly a century.",
      "Particularly tense scenes on Thursday underscored the discontent that many residents of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean feel toward their government, based about 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) away in Paris.",
      "The people of Mayotte, the poorest department in France, have previously said they suffer from underinvestment and neglect by the government. Now, they are expressing disappointment with the response to Cyclone Chido, which hit Saturday.",
      "The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and caused an unknown number of deaths, as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn\u2019t be so extreme. Authorities have said hundreds or possibly thousands may be dead, but the official toll rose to 35 on Friday.",
      "In the morning, Macron visited a neighborhood in Tsingoni on Mayotte\u2019s main island, where people remain without access to drinking water or phone service nearly a week after the storm.",
      "As he walked through the area, some shouted: \u201cWe want water, we want water.\u201d Others, however, offered him a warmer welcome, posing for selfies with the French leader and showing him their children.",
      "But the night before, Macron was met with boos from dozens of residents in Pamandzi on another nearby island.",
      "As people expressed frustration at the slow pace of aid efforts, Macron grabbed a microphone and became angry.",
      "Moving towards the crowd, he said: \u201cI have nothing to do with the cyclone, you can blame me, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d",
      "Macron, who is known for his appetite for debate and for confronting people who are angry at him, vacillated between acknowledging the hardship and pushing back against criticism.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve been through something terrible, everyone\u2019s struggling, regardless of skin color,\u201d he said.",
      "Visibly losing patience, Macron then shouted: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t France, you\u2019d be 10,000 times more screwed!\u201d",
      "The French president added: \u201cThere\u2019s no place in the Indian Ocean where people get so much help!\u201d A woman could be heard saying \u201cwe disagree.\u201d",
      "In a reflection of further frustration, a woman working with local authorities in Mayotte\u2019s capital told The Associated Press on Friday that many deaths recorded by officials on the ground have not yet been published in official tallies.",
      "The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, said most of the people who died were migrants, living in the hills in flimsy houses. Mayotte is home to 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants.",
      "The woman was not able to give her own estimate.",
      "The reported death toll has only slowly ticked up in the week since the cyclone hit and stood at 35 on Friday, even though authorities have said they know that is a dramatic undercount.",
      "Many in Mayotte have expressed disbelief that the toll hasn\u2019t been updated more quickly.",
      "The Interior Ministry said Friday that in addition to the deaths, 67 people were seriously injured and more than 2,400 slightly injured.",
      "\u201cThe number of deaths does not reflect the reality of the 100,000 people living in precarious housing,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe prefect has therefore ordered the deputy prefect to set up a mission to search for the dead.\u201d",
      "It said 70% of residents were \u201cseriously affected.\u201d",
      "The government said it has created a way to count the dead by ordering a census of the population district by district, with the help of mayors and local associations.",
      "In just one example of how the toll might grow, French Health Minister Genevi\u00e8ve Darrieussecq said Friday that about 17% of hospital staff and 40% of all regional health staff on the archipelago are still unaccounted for.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s around 60 to 70 people,\u201d she said on news broadcaster FranceInfo, stressing a large part of the population still has no access to phone service.",
      "Meanwhile, French military and local authorities scrambled to repair busted water pipes across the islands and get water to villages who haven\u2019t had any.",
      "In the village of Mirereni, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) outside Mayotte\u2019s capital, Civil Security officers were trying to remove a large, felled mango tree that busted a water pipe.",
      "The pipe provides water to around 10,000 people in three nearby villages. But officials said repairing it might take longer than usual because of the heat, which impacts equipment.",
      "Locals said they\u2019re worried the lack of water would cause disease. Earlier this year, there was a cholera outbreak on the island, with at least 200 cases.",
      "Mayotte is part an archipelago located between Africa\u2019s east coast and Madagascar that had been a French colony. Its residents voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum while the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros.",
      "In recent decades, the French territory has seen massive migration from Comoros, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, most of whom entered and live illegally in Mayotte.",
      "Macron said Friday fighting illegal immigration was key to state efforts to get Mayotte back on track.",
      "\u201cWhen you have schools where the population has multiplied by five in two years, when you have hospitals that are exploding under migration pressure, they feel they are being abandoned even if the state is doing a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to solve Mayotte\u2019s fundamental problems unless we solve the problem of illegal immigration.\u201d",
      "He has proposed rules that would apply to the territory in order to reduce the numbers of people coming in illegally.",
      "On Thursday, he also announced a special law that would help rebuild Mayotte more quickly and would seek to destroy slums and replace tin shacks with more solid buildings.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration says it is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 public service workers through an existing forgiveness program",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Joe Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through PSLF.",
      "\u201cFrom Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cBecause of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\u201d",
      "Still, the Democrat has fallen short of his goal to deliver widespread relief to millions of other Americans. Biden\u2019s first attempt at mass cancellation was blocked by the Supreme Court, and his second attempt remains tangled in a legal battle brought by Republican states.",
      "In October he proposed another rule that would cancel loans for people facing various kinds of financial hardship, though it's unlikely to take effect.",
      "Trump hasn't detailed student loan plans for his second term, but on the campaign trail he called Biden's cancellation plans illegal and \u201cvile.\u201d Republicans in Congress have slammed Biden over his cancellation work, saying it unfairly transfers the burden to taxpayers who didn't go to college or already repaid their loans.",

      "The strikes are scheduled to begin in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle and could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The union noted that Starbucks' new Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said.",
      "\u201cUnion baristas know their value, and they\u2019re not going to accept a proposal that doesn\u2019t treat them as true partners,\" said Lynne Fox, president of Workers United.",
      "Seattle-based Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. Starbucks has nearly 10,000 company-owned stores in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\u201d Starbucks said in a statement.",

In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, a day when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",

      "PARIS -- Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pain au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie.",
      "The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a distortion of what a croissant is,\u201d Delmontel said. \"A croissant is made with butter.\u201d",
      "One of life\u2019s little pleasures \u2014 butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its rich flavor \u2014 has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake.",
      "Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since.",
      "In Germany, a 250-gram (8.8-ounce) block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality.",
      "The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world\u2019s largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw.",
      "European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can\u2019t hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as \u201cshrinkflation. \u201d",
      "A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces.",
      "Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices.",
      "The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo (2.2 pounds) for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency.",
      "\u201cEvery month butter gets more expensive,\u201d Danuta Osinska, a 77-year-old Polish woman, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw.",
      "She and her husband love butter \u2014 on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior.",
      "\u201cThere is no comparison,\u201d Osinska said. \u201cThings are getting harder and harder.\u201d",
      "The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. Other Poles want to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp.",
      "Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk.",
      "Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause in Poland is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises because of slim profit markets and hard work.",
      "She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link.",
      "Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said.",
      "An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said.",
      "The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to $4.88 per pound over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures.",
      "U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of $5 per pound in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November.",
      "Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation \u2014 or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less.",
      "Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe.",
      "Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said.",

      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year\u2019s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\u201cWhen they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\u201d said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\u201cThey will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\u201d TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \u201ccontinue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\u201d spokesperson Diaz said. \u201cAirport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\u201d",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\u201cBecause travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\u201d Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \u201cIf you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\"",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s role in taking down a bipartisan budget deal shows his ascendance as a political force",
      "In the first major flex of his influence since Donald Trump was elected, Elon Musk brought to a sudden halt a bipartisan budget proposal by posting constantly on his X megaphone and threatening Republicans with primary challenges.",
      "The social media warnings from the world's wealthiest man preceded Trump's condemnation of a measure negotiated by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, which effectively killed the stopgap measure that was designed to prevent a partial shutdown of the federal government.",
      "Washington was scrambled a day after Musk's public pressure campaign. Trump on Thursday declined to say if he had confidence in Johnson, telling NBC News, \u201cWe'll see.\u201d And there was no clear path to keeping the government open beyond Friday, raising the specter of a government shutdown heading into the holidays. Congressional Democrats mocked their GOP counterparts, with several suggesting Trump had been relegated to vice president.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the Elon Musk presidency,\u201d Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California wrote on X.",
      "What was clear, though, is Musk\u2019s ascendance as a political force, a level of influence enabled by his great wealth. In addition to owning X, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and Space X.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt he does wield a lot of influence over Republicans right now due to his proximity to Trump,\u201d said Chris Pack, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund.",
      "But Pack also said that Musk's threats pose potential risks for House Republicans, who begin next year with a five-seat majority that will shrink temporarily because of Trump\u2019s nomination of some GOP lawmakers to administration posts.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to help pass the agenda if you are going to cost a bunch of Republicans in very razor-thin moderate seats if you\u2019re going to make them lose in primaries,\u201d Pack said. \u201cAll that does is give the keys to these districts over to the Democrats.\u201d",
      "Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, contributing heavily to America PAC, a super political action committee that deployed canvassers, aired TV ads and reached voters digitally in battleground states. He had signaled after the election he was willing to back GOP primary challenges to Republican members of Congress seeking re-election in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "He renewed the threat pointedly Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAny member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!\u201d he wrote on X. He also called it \u201cone of the worst bills ever written.\u201d",
      "Musk wasn't alone in fanning GOP anger against the bill, which included several compromise measures to get Democratic support in the Senate in the final weeks before Republicans take control of that chamber. Biotech entrepreneur and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is Musk\u2019s partner leading the new Department of Government Efficiency, also posted against the bill, as did Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Musk played down his role at times, suggesting after some praise online, \u201cAll I can do is bring things to the attention of the people, so they may voice their support if they so choose.\u201d And the president-elect told NBC News that he had spoken to Musk prior to the Tesla CEO's first posts.",
      "\u201cI told him that if he agrees with me, that he could put out a statement,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the incoming White House press secretary, pushed back against Democratic critics who suggested Musk was calling the shots.",
      "\u201cAs soon as President Trump released his official stance on the CR, Republicans on Capitol Hill echoed his point of view,\" Leavitt said in a statement, referring to the continuing resolution. \"President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. Full stop.\u201d",
      "Throughout the day Wednesday, Musk replied to posts on X from Republican House members announcing opposition to the bill with words of thanks, and punctuating their public commitments.",
      "And he took a victory lap after Trump came out against the bill: \u201cThe voice of the people was heard. This was a good day for America.\"",
      "He was responding to Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr's post: \u201cThe phone was ringing off the hook today. And you know why? Because they were reading tweets...from Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\u201d",
      "Conservative activists at the annual AmericaFest gathering in Phoenix cheered Musk Thursday and hailed the suggestion he could replace Johnson as speaker. There\u2019s no requirement that the speaker be an elected member of the House of Representatives.",
      "\u201cShould Mike Johnson remain speaker of the House?\u201d conservative media host Jack Posobiec asked his audience during a live taping of his talk show, prompting a chorus of \u201cNoooooo!!!\u201d from his audience.",
      "Johnson had been scheduled to attend AmericaFest, but canceled after the budget deal fell apart.",

      "American farmers, small business owners and wildfire survivors are among those who will suffer if Congress cannot agree on a new spending bill after President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan that included more than $100 billion i...",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- American farmers, small business owners and wildfire survivors are among those who will suffer if Congress cannot agree on a new spending bill after President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan that included more than $100 billion in disaster aid.",
      "A mayor in Hawaii is watching closely to see what happens because a potential allocation of $1.6 billion in funding is on the line. It's critical to ongoing disaster recovery efforts from the 2023 Maui fire, which proved to be the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.",
      "\u201cI think what funding does is provides people with hope so they can plan for their future,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cAnd the longer we go without funding, the longer people wallow and wonder, is there a chance? Is there a path? Do I cut my losses? Do I leave?\u201d",
      "While money from the Federal Emergency Management Administration has provided temporary relief, the disaster recovery funding was intended for long-term needs such as housing assistance and rebuilding infrastructure, he said. The historic town of Lahaina is still struggling after the August 2023 fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes, leaving behind an estimated $5.5 billion in damage.",
      "The money is also urgently needed after Hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the southeastern United States one after the other this fall. Helene alone was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, killing at least 221 people. Nearly half were in North Carolina where flooding and winds caused an estimated $60 billion in damage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tracking this bill like a hawk right now, to be honest,\u201d Asheville Tea Co. founder and CEO Jessie Dean said. \u201cI think a lot of us are.\u201d",
      "Flooding from Helene in September washed away the company's building along with all of its equipment and inventory. Her small business employs 11 people directly and also works with small farmers in the area to supply the herbs for its teas.",
      "On Thursday, Republicans released a new version of the bill to keep the government operating and restore the disaster aid, but it faced an uncertain pathway. While President-elect Donald Trump lauded the revised plan, Democratic legislative leaders indicated they were opposed. Some Democratic support would likely be needed in the face of opposition by hardline members of the GOP.",
      "\u201cI realize there are other distractions that are going on, but I would just bring everybody back to their commitment to help disaster survivors,\u201d said Bissen, Maui's mayor. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really all this is. We have a proven and established, legitimate disaster that took place. And we are coming up on 16 months, which no other disasters ever had to wait that long for.\u201d",
      "In Asheville, Dean is extremely grateful for support the business has received from customers and nonprofits that is helping it stay afloat right now, but more is needed. So far she has received no money from the U.S. Small Business Administration after applying for a disaster relief loan. Neither have any of the other business owners she knows.",
      "\u201cIn day to day life right now, I'm talking to friends every day who are struggling with the decision around whether or not to continue to run their business, whether or not they can,\" she said.",
      "Many farmers are in the same boat, since about $21 billion of the disaster aid in the earlier version of the bill was assistance for them.",
      "\u201cWithout federal disaster money right now, or without some assistance, people like me will not be farming much longer,\u201d Georgia pecan farmer Scott Hudson said. He farms 2,600 acres (1,050 hectares) of pecans across five counties in southeastern Georgia that were hammered by Hurricane Helene.",
      "\u201cWe lost thousands of trees that will be decades before they are back to where they were the night before the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we lost upwards to 70% of the crop in certain counties.\u201d",
      "Some of his fellow farmers fared even worse.",
      "\u201cWhether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, the farmers need this money,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican ag needs this money ... not to be profitable, to just stay in business.\u201d",
      "People like retired engineer Thomas Ellzey are also counting on disaster aid. He has been living in a mud-filled house in Fairview, North Carolina, for almost three months. Although he pre-qualified for a low-interest loan from the SBA that helps homeowners rebuild, officials have told him the agency does not have the money and is waiting on Congress to act.",
      "Ellzey is 71 years old and said he budgeted carefully for his retirement, trying to prepare for every possible emergency that could come up once he stopped working. But he couldn\u2019t have predicted a hurricane, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything I owned was paid for, including my cars, the house, the land. I had no bills,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing back in debt is kind of rough at my age.\u201d",
      "The earlier version of the spending bill included included funding for low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster; money for rebuilding damaged roads and highways; and funds for helping communities recover through block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The block grant money is one of the key funds for homeowners who don\u2019t have insurance or enough insurance recover from disasters.",
      "Although hurricanes Helene and Milton are the most recent large natural disasters to hit the U.S., a lot of the money was intended more generally for relief from any major disaster in recent years, including droughts and wildfires.",
      "Stan Gimont is senior adviser for community recovery at Hagerty Consulting who used to run the community development block grant program at HUD. He noted that the country is still paying for disasters that happened while it simultaneously prepares for events that will happen in the future.",
      "The Maui fire is a clear example.",
      "\u201cIt took a year to clean that up and to get it to a point where they have removed all the debris, all the toxic materials and the burned up cars, whatever was in those houses,\u201d Gimont said. \u201cSo even though that event occurred in the past, the bills for that are going to come due in the future.\u201d",

      "The average final score over the first week of the College Football Playoffs: Winners 36, Losers 17",
      "For those who dozed through it, or flipped to more compelling fare in the NFL, here's a brief recap of the rollout of the much-anticipated College Football Playoff.",
      "Average final score: Winners 36, Losers 17.",
      "In four games, not a single one was closer than a 10-point margin, and even that one felt worse.",
      "This bold, new experiment was supposed to bring more programs from more parts of the country into the loop of a largely regional sport that had been dominated by about a half-dozen teams for the last decade.",
      "Instead, it will take another 10 days to find out if \u201cmore\u201d really means more \u2014 or if more just means a few weeks of what we just saw before arriving at what we had before \u2014 a group of four contenders battling it out for a title that only they had any realistic chance to win.",
      "One part that did feel like a success was that the stands were full in all four stadiums \u2014 at Texas, Notre Dame, Penn State and Ohio State.",
      "\u201cI think college football got this one right,\u201d Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said after the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 in front of a packed house in what turned out to be the weekend's most compelling game. \u201cAs much as we critique some of the things that are happening in our game right now, this idea of a home playoff game with this 12-team format, this was pretty special.\u201d",
      "The TV ratings will paint a fuller picture, especially of the decision to run directly against two NFL games, both of which came down to the fourth quarter.",
      "The quarterfinals come over the New Year's holiday, where we'll get more clarity not only about who might win the title, but whether the CFP as it is structured is as good as it can be. The matchups (and issues involved in all of them):",
      "Fiesta Bowl, Dec. 31, No. 6 Penn State vs. No. 3 Boise State: The rules called for the four highest-ranked conference champions to receive first-round byes, and so you get this. Penn State is the worse seed but is a 10 1/2-point favorite over the Mountain West Conference champions. Boise State has the nation's leading rusher in Ashton Jeanty. Penn State is probably bigger and faster at every other position.",
      "Peach Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 5 Texas vs. No. 4 Arizona State: See above for thoughts about byes, potential mismatches and pairings that might have made more sense had they come earlier. Texas is a 13 1/2-point favorite. But, the Sun Devils of the Big 12 are the closest thing this tournament has to a Cinderella \u2014 in win-or-you're-done territory since Nov. 2, and with a pair of eminently entertaining players in quarterback Sam Leavitt and running back Cam Skattebo.",
      "Rose Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 8 Ohio State vs. No. 1 Oregon: Had the rule-makers chosen to reseed the bracket after the first round to give Oregon a game against the highest-seeded team left, this would have been the matchup anyway. But do we really want a rematch of possibly the best game in college football this season \u2014 Oregon's 32-31 win over Ohio State in October \u2014 in the quarterfinals?",
      "Sugar Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 7 Notre Dame at No. 2 Georgia: Reports are that Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck might be done for the season after hurting his elbow in the SEC title game. The selection committee was supposed to consider injuries in its rankings, but probably didn't have enough information to make an informed decision at the time. Long ago, in a galaxy far away, Georgia beat Notre Dame in the 1981 Sugar Bowl to capture its second national title.",
      "The transfer portal will (thankfully?) close Dec. 28, meaning the steady trickle of departures from teams with title hopes will not infiltrate the headlines as we head into football's elite eight.",
      "But this entire setup is awkward. Arizona State lost 12 players to the portal after it opened on Dec. 9. Tennessee lost 11. The highest-profile departure was Penn State backup quarterback Beau Pribula. Whether these players would've been on the field much (they wouldn't, which is probably why some left) almost seems beside the point.",
      "For decades, playing to win a championship was thought to be the north star for any elite athlete. Or so we thought. There is a lot of money available, and it's also not hard to blame a player for trying to max out his earning potential in the new world of college football endorsements.",
      "\u201cI think everybody that follows the sport understands that it\u2019s a unique time of year,\u201d Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said. \u201cI\u2019m not in charge of that. Do I think they need to find a way to go through all the processes that they have right now, or things that are in the game but find a better calendar for it? Yeah, I think that would be best for the game for sure.\u201d",
      "There are another 28 bowl games remaining that will have no implication on the national title. Maybe the best one is Dec. 28 when Heisman winner Travis Hunter and Colorado face BYU in the Alamo Bowl.",
      "There's nothing particularly big on the line here, but there is a message being sent.",
      "Colorado has two first-round draft picks on the roster in Hunter and the coach's son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Normally, they wouldn't find themselves anywhere near this game, for fear an injury could derail their pro prospects.",
      "But they will play. Coach Deion Sanders has shouldered his share of criticism for being the face of a largely transactional, money-driven NIL era. But his ability to steer his best two players to find meaning in a game with no stakes is as old-school as it gets, and the exact opposite of the transfer portal mess.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bowl game where we\u2019re going to go be merry and have a Merry Christmas and exchange gifts and do all of that,\u201d the coach explained. \u201cNo, we want to go there and play Buff football.\"",

      "\u201cIt took her 20 seconds to get back into it, and then she was fine,\u201d said Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach.",

      "Since Vonn hadn\u2019t raced in so long, she had to use a new wild card for former champions that enabled her to start No. 31. But that\u2019s still long after the top-ranked skiers start, leaving her with a bumpier and more challenging course.",
      "\u201cIf we can get around those other girls on the same track in the same conditions then you really know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Knight said.",

    "story": [
      "Nebraska's third-largest high school decided not to play varsity girls basketball this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Plunging participation in girls basketball led one of Nebraska's largest high schools to cancel its varsity team for the year.",
      "The decision by Grand Island Senior High School \u2014 the state's third-largest with more than 2,600 students \u2014 reflects a national decline in participation in the girls sport, even as the popularity of women's basketball behind the likes of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has sent record numbers of fans flocking to arenas or tuning in on TV.",
      "Schools across the country have made similar choices, but that hasn\u2019t made the move any easier for those passionate about Grand Island basketball.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the train coming. I mean we\u2019ve been sitting on the tracks forever. But frankly, people just didn\u2019t want to do the heavy lifting that was required,\u201d said Jeremy Jensen, a former Grand Island mayor and high school soccer coach who wishes more had been done to build a sustainable girls basketball program.",
      "The high school in the largely blue-collar city of 52,000 about 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Omaha decided to cancel its varsity and junior varsity teams this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport.",
      "The team suffered a series of lopsided losses, and with many young athletes choosing to specialize in one sport and other activities competing for girls' time, the school decided to focus on developing young players instead of putting a team of freshman and sophomores on the court.",
      "Still, the school's decision was jarring at a time when college and professional women's basketball has been surging in popularity, partly due to the phenomenal success of WNBA Indiana Fever guard Clark, who set records at the University of Iowa.",
      "Kansas State University women\u2019s basketball coach Jeff Mittie said more viewers doesn't necessarily mean more players.",
      "\u201cCertainly in college, all of our games are on TV, easy for people to find, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re playing the sport,\u201d Mittie said. \"It just means they\u2019re interested in watching it.\u201d",
      "Since Clark was born 22 years ago, participation in girls high school basketball has dropped nearly 20% and the sport has fallen from most popular to number four behind volleyball, soccer and track and field, which all have seen double-digit surges in participation, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "Even as the basketball numbers have dropped, total participation in high school sports has grown, with more than 3.4 million girls competing in high school sports last year.",
      "In the past few years in Grand Island, Jim Ward watched every player on his oldest daughter's middle school team quit basketball in high school, either to focus on another sport like volleyball or wrestling or because they lost interest. During that time, the high school girls team was losing games by margins of 70 points or more.",
      "The team lost 43 of its last 44 varsity games and has not won more than three games in a season since 2016-17, with its last winning season in 2009-10.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Grand Island going into Omaha facing some kids that are going to go D-1 (Division I) and you can only keep up with them for the first half of the first quarter, would you want to play longer?\u201d asked Ward, who serves on the booster club board and has a daughter on the team in 10th grade.",
      "Kelli Jefferies knows success is possible in Grand Island because she led the school to its only state championship in 1979 as a player and racked up 231 victories over 33 years as coach before stepping down in 2012.",
      "But Jefferies said she understands the current struggles.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not really able to compete and be competitive, you can see why kids don\u2019t want to do it anymore,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cThat\u2019s not fun for everyone, for coaches and players and anyone involved.\"",
      "The problems in Grand Island and elsewhere run much deeper than a losing record.",
      "In some communities it can be hard for girls to find opportunities to compete and learn the game when they are young. Many families can't afford to invest the thousands of dollars and countless hours required to play club basketball to prepare them to compete in high school, putting them behind in development.",
      "As teams get competitive earlier and earlier, girls might quit the sport if they are cut in grade school.",
      "Families in Grand Island who want their kids to compete at the highest levels of club sports must drive about two hours twice a week to Lincoln or Omaha for practices and again on the weekends for tournaments if they are not traveling farther to other cities.",
      "Grand Island\u2019s current coach, Kathryn Langrehr, works with middle schoolers and offers free basketball clinics at all the city\u2019s elementary schools to help build a pipeline of players for the sport.",
      "But rebuilding could be challenging, especially given the pressure on kids to specialize in just one sport.",
      "\u201cIt kind of speaks to the world that we\u2019re living in with club sports and specialization of sports, where kids want to participate or are only able to participate in one activity,\" said Jon Dolliver, who oversees basketball at the Nebraska School Activities Association.",
      "Volleyball in particular grew tremendously as the sport became much more visible on television and social media and the U.S. emerged as a world power.",
      "The sport is especially popular in Nebraska, where Creighton University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the state system's flagship campus, are ranked in the collegiate top 10. Nebraska fell short in the national semifinals on Friday. Last year, 92,003 people filled Nebraska's football stadium to watch a volleyball match, setting a world record for attendance at a women's sporting event.",
      "Brandon Traudt's daughter was a strong basketball player in middle school after growing up alongside her brother Isaac, who now plays for Creighton, but she always preferred volleyball. She will soon pursue that passion at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI think girls just naturally \u2014 especially in the state of Nebraska \u2014 gravitate towards volleyball,\u201d Traudt said. \u201cVolleyball is just very, very good in this state.\u201d",
      "Maybe the popularity of the WNBA and players like Clark could change the trends, but Ward, the Grand Island dad, can envision an 8-year-old telling her parents she wants to play basketball only to be told there is no time for that with volleyball and dance.",
      "\u201cI think the Caitlin Clark thing \u2014 it\u2019s tough to say if this third grader sees it that she\u2019s just going to quit volleyball and start playing basketball now. I don\u2019t know,\" Ward said."

      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",
      "Even as its challenges aren\u2019t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a \u201ccrossroads,\u201d said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team.",
      "\u201cWhether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,\u201d Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.",
      "That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.",
      "Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.",
      "\u201cBluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,\u201d Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're \u201ctrying to keep everybody happy\u201d are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't \u2014 see Meta's platforms \u2014 the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.",

      "Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.",
      "Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.",
      "His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.",
      "Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.",
      "\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d",
      "Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.",
      "He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.",
      "He later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.",
      "His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d",
      "He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.",
      "But of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d",
      "He had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.",
      "Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.",
      "Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.",

      "\u201cIt is incredibly rewarding for our team to experience success breeding this species,\u201d zoo curator Byron Wusstig said in a statement. \u201cThis species is not endangered, but it is rarely seen in zoo settings outside of Australia.\"",

      "Adult perentie lizards can reach more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length and can weigh more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms), the zoo said. They have brown skin with cream or yellow markings.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Several environmental groups are suing California air regulators over their recent update of a contentious climate program, saying they failed to address the pollution impacts of biofuels.",
      "The lawsuits target the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires California to reduce the environmental impact of transportation fuels by incentivizing producers to cut emissions. The California Air Resources Board voted last month to increase the state\u2019s emission reduction targets, fund charging infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, and phase out incentives for capturing methane emissions from dairy farms to turn into fuel.",
      "California, which often leads the nation on climate policy, plans to achieve so-called carbon neutrality by 2045, meaning the state will remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state has passed policies in recent years to phase out the sale of new fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers.",
      "One of the lawsuits filed this week, by the nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment, accuses the board of failing to thoroughly analyze the climate impacts of burning biofuels derived from plants and animal waste. Another, filed by Food and Water Watch, Central Valley Defenders of Clean Air and Water, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund, focuses on the impact of pollution often impacting low-income and Latino communities from the capture of methane from cow manure to turn into fuel.",
      "\u201cPeople who live near refineries in California are harmed by the spiraling expansion of polluting biofuels,\u201d but CARB failed to analyze the resulting harm to these communities, said a statement by Katherine Ramos, a program director at Communities for a Better Environment.",

      "Amazon workers affiliated with the Teamsters union launched a strike at seven of the company's delivery hubs less than a week before Christmas.",
      "The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations.",
      "The company says it doesn't expect the strike to impact holiday shipments.",
      "Amazon has a couple hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters mainly have focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors that handle package deliveries for the company. But Amazon has rebuffed demands to come to the negotiating table since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees.",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also says the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers.",
      "Here\u2019s what else you need to know:",
      "The strikes are taking place at three delivery hubs in Southern California, and one each in San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta, Georgia, and Skokie, Illinois, according to the union\u2019s announcement.",
      "The union hasn't said how many workers are participating in the strike, nor how long it will go on. Vinnie Perrone, the president of a local Teamsters union in metro New York, said Thursday that the walkout would continue \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d",
      "The union, which claims to represent 10,000 Amazon workers at 10 facilities, said workers in more locations were prepared to join the fight.",
      "Employees at a company air hub in California have authorized a strike. So have workers at an Amazon warehouse in New York, which unionized with the nascent Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and has since affiliated with the Teamsters.",
      "The Teamsters says its local unions are also putting up picket lines at other Amazon warehouses. A company spokesperson said Thursday the strikers were \u201calmost entirely outsiders, not Amazon employees or partners, and the suggestion otherwise is just another lie from the Teamsters.\u201d",
      "The striking workers are fighting for higher wages, better benefits, and safer work conditions.",
      "The Teamsters have tried to get Amazon to come to the negotiating table since last year, when the labor organization first said it had unionized a group of delivery drivers in California who work for a contractor. Amazon -- which denies it employs the workers -- refused, leading the union to file unfair labor charges against the company at the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "In August, prosecutors at the federal labor agency classified Amazon as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of subcontracted drivers. In September, the company boosted hourly pay for the drivers amid the growing pressure.",
      "Amazon warehouse workers who voted to union in the New York City borough of Staten Island also have tried to get the company to engage in contract negotiations.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board certified the Amazon Labor Union election, but the company objected to the representation vote and refused to bargain. In the process, Amazon also filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the labor board, which it aaccused of tainting the vote.",
      "Some organizers involved with the unionization effort there have long believed Amazon would not come to the negotiating table unless workers went on strike.",
      "Amazon says it doesn't expect the strike to impact its operations, but a walkout \u2014 especially one that lasts many days \u2014 could delay shipments in some metro areas.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said Thursday that the company intentionally builds its sites close to where customers are, schedules shipping windows and works with other large carriers, such as UPS, to deliver products.",
      "\u201cWe believe in the strength of our network and plan for contingencies to minimize potential operational impact or costs,\u201d the spokesperson said."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "Suspected drone sightings in the eastern U.S. are continuing to captivate many, but the federal government's authority to track and disable any threatening unmanned aircraft is set to expire after Friday",
      "As suspected drone sightings over the eastern U.S. including New Jersey continue to captivate many, the federal government's authority to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed threatening is set to expire after Friday and a temporary spending bill before Congress that would extend that power is now in question.",
      "Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17.",
      "Federal and local authorities have been investigating sightings of suspected drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.",
      "Tucked into the bipartisan plan to prevent a government shutdown is a provision that would extend the authority of the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed a credible threat from Dec. 20 until March 14.",
      "That authority is vital, homeland security officials and experts say, to detect and disable any threatening drones flying near military bases, the president's location, U.S. borders, prisons and mass gatherings such as New Year's Eve celebrations and the Super Bowl \u2014 and they were hopeful a reauthorization of those powers will be approved before Friday's expiration.",
      "But the temporary spending bill including the reauthorization fell into question Wednesday when President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected it and told Republicans to essentially renegotiate only days before the deadline when federal funding runs out. Congress continued working Thursday to pass a bill to avert a shutdown.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what a lapse in that authority would mean, including to drone detection systems the federal government has deployed to states, including New Jersey where numerous sightings have been reported, at the request of local officials. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office referred questions about the detection systems to Homeland Security officials.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday declined to comment on the expiration of the drone authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, along with other Biden administration officials and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, has repeatedly called for the reauthorization and expansion of the authority for \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d operations, or C-UAS.",
      "\u201cEnsuring that existing authorities do not lapse is vital to our mission, including protecting the president and vice president, patrolling certain designated areas along the Southwest Border, securing certain federal facilities and assets, and safeguarding the public,\u201d Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee in November 2023. \u201cAny lapse in DHS\u2019s current C-UAS authority would entail serious risks for our homeland security, as DHS would have to cease or curtail existing C-UAS operations.\"",
      "Bills in the House and Senate that would extend and expand the federal government's drone powers remain pending. The bills also would allow state and local officials for the first time to track and disable threatening drones under a pilot program overseen by federal authorities.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, was blocked from quickly advancing the Senate bill when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, objected to its passage. Paul said it wasn\u2019t clear there is a threat from drones that warrants urgent action."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:46:20 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been \u201cinadequate\u201d and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.",
      "The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.",
      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.",

      "Andrews added that with \u201cnecessary resources from Congress\u201d the agency would be \"better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.\u201d",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",
      "Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",
      "The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years. They said there have been more than 150 fossils from the extinct elephant relative found statewide to date, about a third of them in Orange County in the same area as the recent find.",
      "Feranec said the newly unearthed jaw provides \u201ca unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.\u201d",
      "The fossils will be carbon-dated and analyzed to determine the mastodon\u2019s age, diet and habitat during its lifetime and will be put on public display sometime in 2025, museum officials said."

    "story": [
      "The federal government says that two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts and that one is likely to die from its injuries",
      "Two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts, and one is likely to die from its injuries, the federal government said.",
      "They are North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 400 and face existential threats from entanglement in gear and collisions with ships. An aerial survey found the whales swimming about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket on Dec. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "One of the whales is a juvenile that has a thick line that passes across its head and back and is likely to succumb to the injury, the agency said in a statement. The other whale is an adult female who biologists think has suffered a sublethal injury from the entanglement, NOAA said.",
      "NOAA said in a statement Tuesday that it would \u201cwork with authorized responders and trained experts to monitor the whales\u201d and that it will \u201cfurther document the entanglements and determine if entanglement responses will be possible.\u201d",
      "The news of the entangled whales follows the release of new data from researchers this fall showing a slight uptick in the whale's population. A group of researchers said two months ago that the population increased about 4% from 2020.",
      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",

      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",

      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",

      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have confirmed that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger.",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price soared nearly 24% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world\u2019s third-largest automaking group. Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

    "summary": "\u201cIf you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democratic senator told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
    "story": [
      "Fetterman said his colleagues should \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said he hopes President-elect Donald Trump is successful in his second term and that he's not \"rooting against him.\"",
      "\"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\" Fetterman told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"So country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"",
      "Fetterman, who has made headlines as one of the few in his party who have met with several of Trump's cabinet picks, said his Democratic colleagues need to \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is expected to soon secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is expected to secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency as soon as Friday, an accomplishment that exceeds his predecessor's total by one after Democrats put extra emphasis on the federal courts following Donald Trump's far-reaching first term when he filled three seats to the Supreme Court.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has teed up votes on two potential California district judges, likely to be the last judicial confirmations this year before the Congress adjourns and makes way for a new, Republican-led Senate. He said he hoped to complete the votes by the end of Friday.",
      "The first confirmation will tie Trump's number, the second will break it. Come next year, Republicans will look to boost Trump's already considerable influence on the makeup of the federal judiciary in his second term.",
      "Biden and Senate Democrats placed particular focus on adding women, minorities and public defenders to the judicial rank. About two-thirds of Biden's appointees are women and a majority of appointees are people of color. The most notable appointee was Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\u201cPrior to our effort, the number of women on the federal bench was really diminished. It was overwhelmingly white males,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWe consciously moved forward to bring more women to the bench, and believe me, we had a great talent pool to work with. So I think it'll enhance the image of the court and its work product to bring these new judges on.\u201d",
      "Biden also placed an emphasis on bringing more civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor rights lawyers to expand the professional backgrounds of the federal judiciary. More than 45 appointees are public defenders and more than two dozen served as civil rights lawyers.",
      "While Biden did get more district judges confirmed than Trump, he had fewer of higher-tier circuit court appointments than Trump \u2014 45 compared to 54 for Trump. And he got one Supreme Court appointment compared to three for Trump. Republicans, much to Democrats frustration, filled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the court the week before the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg had passed away in September.",
      "Democrats also faced the challenge of confirming nominees during two years of a 50-50 Senate. Rarely a week went by in the current Congress when Schumer did not tee up votes on a judicial confirmation as liberal groups urged Democrats to show the same kind of urgency on judges that Republicans exhibited under Trump.",
      "Some Senate Republicans were harshly critical of Biden's choices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said talk of diversity did not extend to the views of the nominees.",
      "\"One of the consequences of the age of Trump is that it drove Democrats insane and it drove them to the extreme left, so they put people on the bench who were selected because they were extreme partisans,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Liberal-leaning advocacy groups said they are delighted with the number of judges Democrats secured, but even more so with the quality of the nominees. They said diversity in personal and professional backgrounds improves judicial decision-making, helps build public trust and inspires people from all walks of life to pursue legal careers.",
      "\u201cFor our federal judiciary to actually deliver equal justice for all, it really has to be for all, and that is one reason why we certainly applaud this administration for prioritizing both professional but also demographic diversity,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",
      "Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Democrats showed newfound resolve on judicial confirmations.",
      "\u201cThey learned a lesson from the first Trump administration,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cPaying attention to the number of judges you get and the type of judges you put on the court is worth it.\u201d",
      "Part of the urgency from Democrats came as they watched the nation's highest court overturn abortion protections, eliminate affirmative action in higher education and weaken the federal government's ability to protect the environment, public health and workplace safety through regulations. The cases showed that the balance of power in Washington extends to the judicial branch.",
      "Trump will inherit nearly three dozen judicial vacancies, but that number is expected to rise because of Republican-appointed judges who held off on retirement in hopes that a Republican would return to office and pick their replacement.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., acknowledged that the sense of accomplishment for Democrats is muted somewhat knowing that Trump will have another term to continue shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ready to uncork the champagne just because we\u2019ve done some really good work over the last four years,\" Blumenthal said. \"We need to be prepared to work, hope for the best and try to defeat nominees who are simply unqualified. We have our work cut out for us. The prospects ahead are sobering.\u201d",
      "Grassley promised that he'll work to best Biden's number.",
      "\u201cLet me assure you, by January 20th of 2029, Trump will be bragging about getting 240 judges,\" Grassley said.",

      "Under current law, the federal government would hit its borrowing limit sometime in the spring of 2025, during the first months of the second Trump presidency. Trump, however, said he wants it taken care of now, while Joe Biden is president.",

      "\"I don't know what it's like to be a gay man, but I know what it's like to be sitting in your truck in your driveway, replaying in your mind all the memories of this kid that was coming to your house for refuge and as a sanctuary,\" said Dunn. \"And I just vowed that, even if I don't understand it, I was going to be that sanctuary to my own child, my own children, and any other kid in this neighborhood that's going through that.\"",
      "Still, this has been a learning process for both families. Both Dunn and Fisher said they had many questions for their child at the start.",
      "Dunn said he's had to let go of the idea that he needs to be \"authoritarian\" over his children's lives.",
      "\"Sometimes we just need to sit back and let them drive the car for a minute,\" Dunn said. \"And of course, we need to be the guardrails, but we need to just let them drive the car for a minute and try to explore and figure out who they are.\"",
      "He said that Melissa knew who she was from a young age: \u201cWe're really doing ourselves an injustice by not honoring the beauty in the fact that they are brave, bold and have courage to be different and not let anybody tell them that they can't be.\"",
      "For Fisher, she said that to be an ally to her child, she needs to trust him in who he says he is: \"I would much rather go through this and make sure that I'm loving my child for who they feel they really are, than trying to love them for something that I want them to be that they don't feel like they are.\"",
      "Hotlines like the Rainbow Youth Project -- a source used by both the Fishers and Dunns -- hope to be a tool for LGBTQ residents, their families and community members grappling with similar questions.",
      "During this stressful season, Melissa asks people to be kind.",
      "\"It doesn't take anything extra to just leave me alone and let me live my life,\" she said. \"I don't need another parent or a stranger telling me that I'm wrong. It doesn't take anything to be nice and be kind, and we are already going through a lot of pain.\"",
      "If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for free, confidential emotional support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",

      "But in a Thursday interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, Trump suggested the impact of the U.S. government defaulting on its bills could \"possibly mean nothing.\"",
      "\"Nobody really knows. It means nothing, but psychologically, it may mean a lot, right? In other words, it doesn't have a real meaning other than you've violated something,\" Trump told Karl. \"And that may be just, you know, one day, half a story, or it may lead to the depression of 1929, and nobody wants to take the chance, except the Democrats.\"",
      "Despite Trump's suggestion, economic experts have said they agree that breaching the debt ceiling would certainly lead to economic chaos.",
      "\"It would be disastrous for the American economy, for global financial markets and for millions of families and workers whose financial security would be jeopardized by delayed payments,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers during a 2021 standoff over the debt ceiling.",
      "Raising the debt ceiling, Yellen testified, is \"necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy.\"",
      "Here's a primer on the debt ceiling and examples of the possible consequences if the United States is unable to pay its debts.",
      "What is the debt ceiling?",
      "The debt ceiling is a cap on the amount of money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its debts.",
      "Every year, Congress passes a budget that includes government spending on infrastructure, salaries for federal workers and programs such as Social Security. Congress also taxes people to pay for all that spending. But for years, the government has been spending more than it takes in from taxes and other revenue, increasing the federal deficit.",
      "The government needs to borrow money to continue paying out what Congress has already approved, but the debt ceiling puts a limit on how much money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its bills.",
      "What would happen if the US can no longer pay its bills?",
      "If the government cannot borrow money to continue paying for programs, there will be real-world effects for millions of people. Here are some of the possible ones, according to the Treasury Department and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan organization.",

      "Would this be worse than a government shutdown?",
      "Yes. This is an even bigger deal than a government shutdown. A government shutdown occurs when Congress does not approve a new spending bill for the next fiscal year, so new payments, such as paychecks, are stopped. In 2019, around 800,000 federal employees were affected by a government shutdown, and markets dipped.",
      "But the U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. Such an unprecedented situation would destabilize markets, spike interest rates and roil the economic system. Some payments that continue under government shutdowns, such the Social Security payments many seniors rely on as their income, could be stopped.",
      "\"Many more parties are not paid in a default,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said. \"Without enough money to pay its bills, any of the payments are at risk, including all government spending, mandatory payments, interest on our debt and payments to U.S. bondholders. While a government shutdown would be disruptive, a government default could be disastrous.\"",
      "Since the debt ceiling system was instituted in 1917, Congress has never not raised the debt ceiling. Congress has voted 78 times to raise or suspend the debt limit since 1960.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 15:02:26 -0500",
    "summary": "A Georgia appeals court disqualified Fulton County DA Fani Willis from her election interference prosecution of Donald Trump, but has allowed the indictment to stand.",
    "story": [
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified the Fulton County DA from the case.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday disqualified Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from her prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump and his co-defendants in their election interference case.",
      "\"After carefully considering the trial court's findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office\" over what the appeals court called \"a significant appearance of impropriety,\" the ruling said.",
      "The criminal indictment against Trump and his co-defendants still stands, the court said.",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.",
      "Defendants Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and Scott Hall subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "Following the Thursday's ruling, the Fulton County DA's office filed notice that they intend to appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. A spokesperson for the DA's office declined to comment further to ABC News.",
      "The appeals court ruling leaves the question of who takes over the case -- and whether it continues -- to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. That decision may be delayed due to the appeals process.",
      "The case has been on pause after Trump and his co-defendants launched an effort to have Willis disqualified from the case over her relationship with fellow prosecutor Nathan Wade. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, leading Trump to appeal that decision.",
      "The appeals court ruled to disqualify Willis and her entire office from the case because \"no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring,\" the order said, reversing Judge McAfee's original decision.",
      "Wade, who had been the lead prosecutor in the case, resigned as special prosecutor in March after McAfee issued his ruling that either Willis or Wade must step aside from the case due to a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" stemming from a romantic relationship between the DA and the prosecutor.",
      "While the appeals court disqualified Willis and her office, it did not find enough evidence to justify \"the extreme sanction\" of tossing the entire indictment against Trump and his co-defendants, as Trump had sought in his appeal.",
      "\"While this is the rare case in which DA Willis and her office must be disqualified due to a significant appearance of impropriety, we cannot conclude that the record also supports the imposition of the extreme sanction of dismissal of the indictment under the appropriate standard,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The Georgia Court Of Appeals in a well-reasoned and just decision has held that DA Fani Willis\u2019 misconduct in the case against President Trump requires the disqualification of Willis and her office,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said in response to the ruling. \"The Court highlighted that Willis\u2019 misconduct created an 'odor of mendacity' and an appearance of impropriety that could only be cured by the disqualification of her and her entire office. As the Court rightfully noted, only the remedy of disqualification will suffice to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Judge Clay Land -- one of the three judges on the appeals panel -- dissented from the decision, arguing that reversing the trial court \"violates well-established precedent, threatens the discretion given to trial courts, and blurs the distinction between our respective courts.\"",
      "Land argued that the appearance of impropriety -- rather than a true conflict of interest -- is not enough to reverse Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify Willis.",
      "\"For at least the last 43 years, our appellate courts have held that an appearance of impropriety, without an actual conflict of interest or actual impropriety, provides no basis for the reversal of a trial court's denial of a motion to disqualify,\" he wrote.",
      "In his dissent, Land emphasized that the trial court found that Willis did not have a conflict of interest and rejected the allegations of impropriety stemming from her relationship with Wade, including the allegation that she received a financial benefit from his hiring.",
      "\"It was certainly critical of her choices and chastised her for making them. I take no issue with that criticism, and if the trial court had chosen, in its discretion, to disqualify her and her office, this would be a different case,\" he wrote. \"But that is not the remedy the trial court chose, and I believe our case law prohibits us from rejecting that remedy just because we don't like it or just because we might have gone further had we been the trial judge.\"",
      "The Georgia election interference case is one of four criminal cases that were brought against Trump after he left the White House in 2021. His two federal cases, on charges of interfering with the 2020 election and refusing to return classified documents, were dropped following Trump's reelection last month, due to a longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing in New York, following his conviction on charges of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 election, was postponed indefinitely following Trump\u2019s reelection last month."

      "Officials in Fiji say a toxicology report shows seven foreign tourists who were hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar were not poisoned by alcohol or illicit drugs",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Seven foreign tourists who were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar were not poisoned by alcohol or illicit drugs, officials said Wednesday following a toxicology report.",
      "The cause of the tourists' illness over the weekend remains under investigation, Fiji\u2019s Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka said.",
      "\u201cI can confirm that no illicit substances or methanol were found in the ingredients or liquor samples,\u201d Gavoka told reporters in the capital, Suva.",
      "\u201cThe findings that there is no evidence of alcohol poisoning is great news for Fiji, especially for our vital tourism industry,\u201d he added.",
      "All seven tourists have since fully recovered, he said.",
      "They became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday.",
      "The tourists, including Australians and an American, were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, Fiji\u2019s Health Ministry said.",
      "News outlets had reported the cause of the foreigners\u2019 illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos last month in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming drinks tainted with methanol.",
      "The suspicion of methanol poisoning was a blow to Fiji\u2019s tourism industry, which has a reputation for providing safe food and drinks.",
      "Alcohol poisoning is a common danger in many poorly regulated tourist destinations, where reputable brands of spirits are substituted with locally distilled ethanol. Methanol can be an unintended byproduct of unprofessional distillation.",
      "Fiji Permanent Secretary for Health Jemesa Tudravu said the illnesses could have been caused by a chemical reaction or infection. His department was continuing to investigate.",
      "Gavoka urged foreign governments to remove from their travel advisories warnings a risk of drink spiking in Fiji that emerged this week.",
      "He said the tourist industry had been rocked by media reports of suspected contaminated drinks, but tourists had not canceled their vacations.",
      "\u201cThere is no indication of people canceling. What we hear is people who are in a sense of disbelief that Fiji could be spiking drinks or Fiji could be adding some harmful stuff into the cocktails,\u201d Gavoka said.",
      "Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said the incident had been confined to a single resort.",
      "\u201cWe'd like to tell everybody that it's safe to come to Fiji and we have to also find out who has been giving out the negative press about Fiji as a destination. Are they competitors for our tourist visitors?\u201d Rabuka said to reporters."

      "Decades after a former Chicago mayor pledged to extend transit to the city\u2019s far South Side, the federal government is committing to the massive project just before President Joe Biden leaves office",
      "CHICAGO -- Adella Bass dropped her in-person college classes because it was just too hard to get there from the far South Side of Chicago, where the city's famous elevated train doesn't run. And it can take her nearly two hours to get to the hospital where she is treated for a heart condition.",
      "But things are looking up, with bright red signs across the area boldly proclaiming, \"Ready, Set, Soon!\u201d Next year, the city is poised to start making good on a decades-old promise to connect some of its most isolated, poor and polluted neighborhoods to the rest of the city through mass transit.",
      "The Biden administration notified Congress last week that it would commit $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations on the South Side, the Chicago system\u2019s largest expansion project in history. The pledge, which the Federal Transit Administration is expected to formally sign before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, essentially locks in current and future funding.",
      "Still, Bass fears President-elect Donald Trump's administration might try to scuttle it.",
      "Signals abound to assure residents that the project is \u201ca go,\u201d said Bass, who is raising three young children and works on health equity issues that affect residents of a massive public housing development near her South Side home. \"But you just never know with Trump.\u201d",
      "The $1 trillion infrastructure plan Biden signed into law in 2021 focused far more heavily on transit than anything his predecessor advocated. That is why there has been a scramble to finalize some transit grants before Biden's term ends, including commitments last week for rapid transit upgrades in San Antonio and Salt Lake City.",
      "Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, said Trump unsuccessfully encouraged Congress in his first term to pass budgets eliminating funding for some new transit projects that hadn't secured their grant agreements. But it has been practically unheard of for administrations to claw back projects after they won final approval.",
      "Steve Davis, who handles transportation strategy for Smart Growth America, said Trump could try to redirect future competitive grants to prioritize highway construction over alternative transportation methods such as transit. He said Trump's Transportation Department could potentially slow down some allocations from already approved infrastructure projects but would have trouble halting them entirely.",
      "\u201cIf you're building an enormous $2 billion road widening, you need to know you're going to have money in year four or five and there's nothing a hostile administration could do to stop it,\u201d Davis said.",
      "One of the communities that would be served by a new Chicago L station is Roseland, a once-thriving, predominantly Black business district that has fallen victim to the loss of manufacturing and a spike in crime.",
      "Jervon Hicks, who spent many years in and out of jail on gun charges, turned his life around and ended up becoming a mentor for at-risk youth. The new station could help quicken the same transition for others, he said.",
      "\u201cRoseland needs a makeover,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cWe lack a pet store. We used to have a theater. Take some of these abandoned buildings and turn them into job opportunities.\u201d",
      "Unlike the busy \u201cMagnificent Mile\u201d shopping district on Michigan Avenue in the downtown Chicago Loop, the business district on South Michigan Avenue in Roseland has fallen from more than 90% occupancy decades ago to around 10% now.",
      "Among the surviving businesses is Edwards Fashions. Owner Ledall Edwards hopes transportation will spur more to return.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get to the level it was back in the 1970s, but I think the environment is going to improve because of the accessibility,\" he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to get people here in this area much faster.\u201d",
      "Rogers Jones, who for 30 years has run the Youth Peace Center next to the future train station, said he can't wait for the transformation.",
      "\u201cThe community is going to change,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a vibrant community, and people are excited. I know I\u2019m excited.\u201d",
      "Former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley told residents of Roseland and surrounding areas in 1969 that the L would eventually expand there.",
      "Tammy Chase, a spokesperson for the Chicago Transit Authority, said the cost then would have been $114 million compared to around $5.7 billion now, a figure that would keep rising the longer construction is delayed.",
      "The agency has hired a construction firm, opened a Roseland office in a former paint store and begun boarding up homes that will be demolished for the tracks to run through. Ground is expected to be broken in late 2025, Chase said.",
      "U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees transportation spending, points out Chicago's transit system survived wars and depression. It surely also can withstand a pandemic and a presidential administration with different priorities, he said.",
      "\u201cThe big infrastructure projects stand the test of time,\u201d Quigley said. \"These ups and downs, you have to adjust to them, but you recognize transit always comes back. If transit doesn\u2019t come back, it stymies opportunities going forward.\u201d"

      "The 43-year-old had been serving a 12-year prison sentence for first-degree assault since 2017, according to the department.",
      "State Department of Corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello III also denounced the staffers' actions and said the suspensions are \u201cin the best interest of the agency and the communities we serve.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no place for brutality in our department and we will vigorously pursue justice against the individuals who committed this senseless act,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \"These investigations are ongoing and additional suspensions may be issued.\u201d",
      "The labor union representing correctional officers didn't immediately comment.",
      "Brooks' family said in a statement from their lawyer that they are \u201cincredibly shocked and saddened\" about the death, according to The Times-Union in Albany, which first reported the death.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful that Gov. Hochul is taking swift action to hold officers accountable, but we cannot understand how this could have happened in the first place,\u201d the family said in its statement, according to the newspaper. \u201cNo one should have to lose a family member this way.\u201d",
      "State Attorney General Letitia James said her office is also investigating the use of force by correction officers that led to the death.",
      "The Democrat said her staff has obtained video of the incident and will make it public after Brooks' family has viewed it.",
      "\u201cLaw enforcement professionals must be held to the highest standards of accountability, and I am committed to providing New Yorkers with the transparency they deserve,\" James said in a statement."

      "Federal officials have joined with the state of Arizona to begin fulfilling a settlement agreement that was reached with the Hopi Tribe nearly three decades ago",
      "Federal officials have joined with the state of Arizona to begin fulfilling a settlement agreement that was reached with the Hopi Tribe nearly three decades ago, marking what tribal officials described as a historic day.",
      "Government attorneys filed condemnation documents on Friday to transfer dozens of square miles of state land into trust for the Hopi. The tribe will compensate the state nearly $4 million for more than 31 square miles (80 square kilometers) of land near Winslow.",
      "It could mark the first of more transfers of land into trust to help eliminate the checkerboard of ownership that characterizes much of the lands used by the tribe for ranching in northeastern Arizona.",
      "Friday's filing was born out of the 1996 passage of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act, which ratified an agreement between the Hopi and federal government that set conditions for taking land into trust for the tribe.",
      "The wrangling over land in northeastern Arizona has been bitter, pitting the Hopi and the Navajo Nation against one another for generations. The federal government failed in its attempt to have the tribes share land and after years of escalating conflict, Congress in 1974 divided the area and ordered tribal members to leave each other's reservations.",
      "The resulting borders meant the Navajo Nation \u2014 the country\u2019s largest reservation at 27,000 square miles \u2014 surrounded the 2,500-square-mile Hopi reservation.",
      "Since the 1996 settlement, the Hopi Tribe has purchased private land and sought to take neighboring state lands into trust in hopes of consolidating property for the tribe's benefit.",
      "There have been many roadblocks along the way, including in 2018 when the tribe sought the support of local governments in northern Arizona to back a proposed transfer for land south of the busy Interstate 40 corridor. Those efforts were stymied by the inclusion of national forest tracts in the Flagstaff area.",
      "Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma said in a statement Friday that he was grateful for everyone who worked to make the condemnation filing a reality and that the timing for this historic moment was fitting.",
      "\u201cWithin Hopi, it is our time of the soyal\u2019ang ceremony \u2014 the start of the New Year and the revitalization of life,\u201d he said.",
      "Gov. Katie Hobbs, who first visited the Hopi reservation in 2023, acknowledged that the tribe has been fighting for its rights for decades and that politicians of the past had refused to hear the voices of tribal communities.",
      "\u201cEvery Arizonan should have an opportunity to thrive and a space to call home, and this agreement takes us one step closer to making those Arizona values a reality,\u201d she said Friday.",
      "In November, the Navajo Nation signed a warranty deed to take into trust a parcel of land near Flagstaff as part of the federal government\u2019s outstanding obligations to support members of that tribe who were forcibly relocated as a result of the Navajo-Hopi dispute.",
      "Navajo leaders are considering building a casino on the newly acquired land, saying such a project would provide significant economic benefits.",
      "For the Hopi, bringing more land into trust also holds the promise of more economic opportunities. The state lands near Winslow that are part of the condemnation filing are interspersed with Hopi-owned lands and have long been leased to the tribe for ranching and agricultural purposes, according to the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "Federal officials said Friday's filing is the first of an anticipated series of condemnation actions that ultimately would result in the transfer of more than 170 square miles (440 square kilometers) of state land into trust for the Hopi Tribe."

      "Congress is allocating more than $100 billion in emergency aid to address extensive damage caused by hurricane and other disasters",
      "WASHINGTON -- Congress is allocating more than $100 billion in emergency aid designed to address extensive damage caused by disasters after this week's scramble to find consensus on a government spending bill.",
      "The money comes after back-to-back hurricanes \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 slammed into the southeastern United States this fall, leaving havoc in their wake. But the money would go to much more than just those two storms under the bill meant to keep the federal government funded through March 14.",
      "The disaster funding looked set to pass earlier this week until President-elect Donald Trump issued new demands that tanked a compromise and threatened a pre-Christmas federal shutdown. A slimmed-down version cleared Congress early Saturday when Republicans abandoned Trump's core request.",
      "Here's a look at what's in the bill for disaster relief and where the money will go:",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund is essentially the country's checkbook for emergencies. Out of it, the government reimburses states and local governments for things such as removing debris accumulated after hurricanes or overtime costs for firefighters and police who work during disasters.",
      "It also includes money for individual residents, ranging from the $750 payments that disaster survivors can get to $42,500 that some uninsured homeowners can receive to help them rebuild.",
      "Esther Manheimer, mayor of Asheville, the largest city in the North Carolina mountains that was hard hit by Helene, said city officials were pleased to see th additional disaster dollars.",
      "It\u2019s only been four weeks since Asheville residents could drink from and bathe in the water coming out of their faucets. Some businesses in western North Carolina have shuttered permanently or are struggling to survive, and well over 200 roads in the region remain closed.",
      "In a statement earlier in the week, Manheimer emphasized that it was still going to be a long recovery and that \"already we see the long-term economic, budgetary and employment impact Helene left in her wake.\u201d",
      "The disaster relief fund was nearly running on fumes after Helene and Milton. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell warned during a Senate hearing in November that the fund was down to $5 billion.",
      "The Biden administration had asked Congress for about $40 billion for the relief fund but the bill eventually passed provides a lower amount, $29 billion.",
      "It\u2019s important to keep in mind that this isn\u2019t the only money for the disaster relief fund, said Stan Gimont, a senior adviser for community recovery at Hagerty Consulting. He used to run the community development block grant program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "More money can and likely will be designated to the fund later when Congress does a full-year appropriation, he said.",
      "There's also about $21 billion in disaster assistance to help farmers.",
      "North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said earlier this week that he was pleased by the agricultural aid but that the state has a lot of specialty crops such as sweet potatoes and Christmas trees that are generally not covered by federal programs. He said he will have to wait and see what specifically ends up being covered.",
      "\u201cWe are still evaluating the bill as there are a lot of nuances in it. The devil is in the details,\" he said.",
      "Other money will go toward rebuilding damaged roads and highways ($8 billion), while more money (about $12 billion) would go toward helping communities recover through HUD grants.",
      "The block grant money is one of the key funds for homeowners who don\u2019t have insurance or enough insurance to recover from disasters.",
      "There\u2019s also $2.2 billion for low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster.",
      "But the money doesn't go just toward local residents.",
      "For example, there's money for the military to address damage from hurricanes and typhoons and for a new hurricane hunter \u2014 the planes used to research hurricanes \u2014 and funds to help NASA rebuild hurricane-damaged facilities.",
      "No. The money goes to cover more than those two disasters.",
      "Some of the money is specifically earmarked for certain projects such as $1.5 billion designated for assistance after the largest wildfire in New Mexico\u2019s recorded history \u2014 the Hermit\u2019s Peak/Calf Canyon fire \u2014 and the rebuilding of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.",
      "But a lot of the money also goes more generally toward major disasters that happened in recent years.",
      "The types of disasters covered in the legislation include droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, and smoke exposure.",
      "Gimont points out that disaster recovery can take a long time so the country is both paying for disasters that happened previously while it prepares for events that will happen in the future.",
      "Take the massive Maui fire, for instance. It decimated the Hawaiian town of Lahaina last year, but Gimont said just the cleanup itself extended into late summer 2024.",

      "A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct",
      "WASHINGTON -- A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct.",
      "Any movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows.",
      "The 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors.",
      "The court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices.",
      "\u201cThe highest court in the land can\u2019t have the lowest ethical standards,\u201d the committee chairman, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics.",
      "Republicans have said the investigation is a way to undermine the conservative majority court, and all the Republicans on the committee protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected.",
      "Thomas has said that he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife, Ginni, took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since gone back and reported some travel. Crow has maintained that he has never spoken with his friend about pending matters before the court.",
      "The report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he \u201cestablished the practice\u201d of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said.",
      "The investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. \u201cThe number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,\u201d according to the report.",
      "It also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules.",
      "Alito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito has said the flags were raised by this wife.",
      "Thomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "The report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers, or involving companies in which justices owned stock.",
      "Biden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kaganhas publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge.",
      "The report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts\u2019 oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress."

      "Thirty years after Florida required schools to teach African American history, how the subject is taught remains inconsistent across Florida classrooms, a review by The Associated Press has found",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Buried among Florida's manicured golf courses and sprawling suburbs are the artifacts of its slave-holding past: the long-lost cemeteries of enslaved people, the statutes of Confederate soldiers that still stand watch over town squares, the old plantations turned into modern subdivisions that bear the same name. But many students aren't learning that kind of Black history in Florida classrooms.",
      "In an old wooden bungalow in Delray Beach, Charlene Farrington and her staff gather groups of teenagers on Saturday mornings to teach them lessons she worries that public schools won't provide. They talk about South Florida's Caribbean roots, the state's dark history of lynchings, how segregation still shapes the landscape and how grassroots activists mobilized the Civil Rights Movement to upend generations of oppression.",
      "\u201cYou need to know how it happened before so you can decide how you want it to happen again,\" she told her students as they sat as their desks, the morning light illuminating historic photographs on the walls.",
      "Florida students are giving up their Saturday mornings to learn about African American history at the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum in Delray Beach and in similar programs at community centers across the state. Many are supported by Black churches, which for generations have helped forge the cultural and political identity of their parishioners.",
      "Since Faith in Florida developed its own Black history toolkit last year, more than 400 congregations have pledged to teach the lessons, the advocacy group says.",
      "Florida has required public schools to teach African American history for the past 30 years, but many families no longer trust the state's education system to adequately address the subject.",
      "By the state\u2019s own metrics, just a dozen Florida school districts have demonstrated excellence at teaching Black history, by providing evidence that they are incorporating the content into lessons throughout the school year and getting buy-in from the school board and community partners.",
      "School district officials across Florida told The Associated Press that they are still following the state mandate to teach about the experience of enslavement, abolition and the \"vital contributions of African Americans to build and strengthen American society.\u201d",
      "But a common complaint from students and parents is that the instruction seems limited to heroic figures like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and rarely extends beyond each February's Black History Month.",
      "When Sulaya Williams' eldest child started school, she couldn't find the comprehensive instruction she wanted for him in their area. So in 2016, she launched her own organization to teach Black history in community settings.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to make sure that our children knew our stories, to be able to pass down to their children,\" Williams said.",
      "Williams now has a contract to teach Saturday school at a public library in Fort Lauderdale, and her 12-year-old daughter Addah Gordon invites her classmates to join her.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m really learning my culture. Like I\u2019m learning what my ancestors did,\u201d Addah said. \u201cAnd most people don\u2019t know what they did.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers unanimously approved the African American history requirement in 1994 at a time of atonement over Florida's history.",
      "Historians commissioned by the state had just published an official report on the deadly attack on the town of Rosewood in 1923, when a white mob razed the majority-Black community and drove out its residents. When the Florida Legislature approved financial compensation for Rosewood's survivors and descendants in 1994, it was seen as a national model for reparations.",
      "\u201cThere was a moment of enlightenment in Florida, those decades ago. There really was,\" said Marvin Dunn, who has authored multiple books on Black Floridians. \u201cBut that was short-lived.\u201d",
      "Three decades later, the teaching of African American history remains inconsistent across Florida classrooms, inadequate in the eyes of some advocates, and is under fire by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has championed efforts to restrict how race, history and discrimination can be talked about in the state\u2019s public schools.",
      "DeSantis has led attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d in education that rallied conservatives nationwide, including President-elect Donald Trump. In 2022, the governor signed a law restricting certain race-based conversations in schools and businesses and prohibits teaching that members of one ethnic group should feel guilt or bear responsibility for actions taken by previous generations.",
      "Last year, DeSantis\u2019 administration blocked a new Advanced Placement course on African American Studies from being taught in Florida, saying it violates state law and is historically inaccurate.",
      "A spokesperson for the College Board, which oversees Advanced Placement courses, told the AP they are not aware of any public schools in Florida currently offering the African American Studies class. It's also not listed in the state's current course directory.",
      "Representatives for the Florida Department of Education and the state's African American History Task Force did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.",
      "\u201cPeople who are interested in advancing African diaspora history can\u2019t rely on schools to do that,\u201d said Tameka Bradley Hobbs, manager of Broward County's African-American Research Library and Cultural Center. \"I think it\u2019s even more clear now that there needs to be a level of self-reliance and self-determination when it comes to passing on the history and heritage of our ancestors.\u201d",
      "Last year, only 30 of Florida's 67 traditional school districts offered at least one standalone course on African American history or humanities, according to state data. While not required by state law, having a dedicated Black history class is a measure of how districts are following the state mandate.",
      "Florida's large urban districts are far more likely to offer the classes, compared to small rural districts, some of which have fewer than 2,000 students.",
      "Even in districts that have staff dedicated to teaching Black history, some teachers are afraid of violating state law, according to Brian Knowles, who oversees African American, Holocaust and Latino studies for the Palm Beach County school district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many other districts and so many kids that we\u2019re missing because we\u2019re tiptoeing around what is essentially American history,\u201d Knowles said.",
      "Frustration over the restrictions that teachers face pushed Renee O'Connor to take a sabbatical last year from her job teaching Black history at Miami Norland Senior High School in the majority-Black city of Miami Gardens. Now, she is back in the classroom, but she also has been helping community groups develop their own Black history programs outside of the public school system.",
      "\u201cI wish, obviously, all kids were able to take an African American history class,\u201d O'Connor said, \u201cbut you have to pivot if it\u2019s not happening in schools.\u201d",

      "Hopkins is among farmers across the South who are still reeling from Helene\u2019s devastation. The storm made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26 as a major Category 4 storm and then raced north across Georgia and neighboring states.",
      "Experts estimate the cost to farmers, timber growers and other agribusinesses from Florida to Virginia will reach more than $10 billion. The toll includes ravaged crops, uprooted timber, wrecked farm equipment and mangled chicken houses, as well as indirect costs such as lost productivity at cotton gins and poultry processing plants.",
      "For cotton growers like Hopkins, Helene hit just as the fall harvest was starting. Many put most cleanup on hold to try to salvage what remained of their crops.",
      "Georgia farmers suffered storm losses of at least $5.5 billion, according to an analysis by the University of Georgia. In North Carolina, a state agency calculated farmers suffered $3.1 billion in crop losses and recovery costs after Helene brought record rainfall and flooding. Separate economic analyses of farm damage tallied losses of up to $630 million in Virginia, $452 million in South Carolina and $162 million in Florida.",
      "Hopkins figures he lost half the cotton on his 1,400 acres (560 hectares).",
      "\u201cWe were at the most vulnerable stage we could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lint was open and fluffy and hanging there, waiting to be defoliated or picked. About 50% of the harvestable lint ended up on the ground.\u201d",
      "Even with insurance, Hopkins said, he won't recoup an estimated $430,000 in losses from his cotton crop alone. That doesn't include the cost of debris removal, repairing or replacing damaged machinery and the loss of two small pecan orchards uprooted by the storm.",
      "The storm ripped through blooming cotton fields, pecan orchards laden with nuts and fields where fall vegetables like cucumbers and squash awaited picking. Hundreds of large poultry houses used to raise thousands of chickens at a time got destroyed.",
      "Farmers far from Helene's center weren't spared, as tropical-storm force winds reached outward up to 310 miles (499 kilometers).",
      "\u201cIt was staggering,\u201d said Timothy Coolong, a University of Georgia horticulture professor. \u201cThis may be just too much for some folks.\"",
      "Helene was one of the deadliest U.S. hurricanes in nearly two decades, killing more than 200 people. It left more than 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed across the South.",
      "Georgia's government in November diverted $100 million that had been set aside for construction projects or paying off existing debt to fund emergency loans to farmers and cleanup in Helene's aftermath. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has made additional storm relief a priority for the upcoming legislative session.",
      "But Georgia's constitution prohibits using state funds to give direct disaster aid to individuals and private businesses.",
      "In Congress, a new plan late Friday that would temporarily fund federal operations included billions in disaster aid to farmers.",
      "\u201cWe need help, but we need it quick,\" said Jeffrey Pridgen, a fifth-generation farmer who raises chickens in south Georgia\u2019s Coffee County.",
      "Pridgen operated a dozen poultry houses, each large enough to raise up to 20,000 chickens at a time. Helene destroyed four of them, along with thousands of chickens. Only one of Pridgen's houses remains in working condition, the others having been badly damaged.",
      "Pridgen said new chicken houses will cost about $450,000 apiece. Because most of his were decades old, he expects insurance to cover just half the cost.",
      "\u201cI was looking at retirement, but I lost my retirement and my income in one day,\u201d said Pridgen, 62. \"It\u2019ll be two years before we get fully operational again. I\u2019m basically starting over.\u201d",
      "Georgia\u2019s poultry industry took an estimated $683 million hit, with farmers having to rebuild about 300 chicken houses and repair hundreds more.",
      "The poultry processing plant that relies on Pridgen and other storm-impacted farmers for chickens is now operating just four days per week, he said.",
      "\u201cNow for at least a year, perhaps a little bit longer, we\u2019re in rebuilding mode,\" said Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation. \"That affects production in an area for an extended period of time.\u201d",
      "Helene's devastation shouldn't have much impact on consumer prices because crops grown elsewhere can make up for most shortages, said Michael Adjemian, a University of Georgia professor of agricultural economics. Pecans are one possible exception. Georgia is responsible for roughly one-third of U.S. production.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, even a terrible storm like this is going to have a relatively small impact,\u201d Adjemian said. \"And maybe it's not even noticeable, depending on the product.\u201d",
      "Helene cost Georgia cotton farmers roughly one-third of their crop, with direct and indirect losses valued at $560 million. Some were still recovering from Hurricane Michael in 2018.",
      "Cotton growers also were facing low prices this harvest season of around 70 cents per pound (0.45 kilograms), said Taylor Sills, executive director of the Georgia Cotton Commission. That meant they needed a big yield to turn any profit.",
      "\u201cTimes were awful, and then they got hit by a hurricane,\u201d Sills said. \"There are people who lost everything and there are people who didn\u2019t. But everybody lost something.\"",

      "Santa and Mrs. Claus this week took supersized rides to southeast Alaska in a C-17 military cargo plane and a camouflaged Humvee, as they delivered toys to the Tlingit village of Yakutat, northwest of Juneau.",
      "The visit was part of this year\u2019s Operation Santa Claus, an outreach program of the Alaska National Guard to largely Indigenous communities in the nation\u2019s largest state. Each year, the Guard picks a village that has suffered recent hardship \u2014 in Yakutat's case, a massive snowfall that threatened to buckle buildings in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the funnest things we get to do, and this is a proud moment for the National Guard,\u201d Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard, said Wednesday.",
      "Saxe wore a Guard uniform and a Santa hat that stretched his unit's dress regulations.",
      "The Humvee caused a stir when it entered the school parking lot, and a buzz of \u201cIt\u2019s Santa! It\u2019s Santa!\u201d pierced the cold air as dozens of elementary school children gathered outside.",
      "In the school, Mrs. Claus read a Christmas story about the reindeer Dasher. The couple in red then sat for photos with nearly all of the 75 or so students and handed out new backpacks filled with gifts, books, snacks and school supplies donated by the Salvation Army. The school provided lunch, and a local restaurant provided the ice cream and toppings for a sundae bar.",
      "Student Thomas Henry, 10, said while the contents of the backpack were \u201cpretty good,\u201d his favorite item was a plastic dinosaur.",
      "Another, 9-year-old Mackenzie Ross, held her new plush seal toy as she walked around the school gym.",

      "Yakutat, a Tlingit village of about 600 residents, is in the lowlands of the Gulf of Alaska, at the top of Alaska\u2019s panhandle. Nearby is the Hubbard Glacier, a frequent stop for cruise ships.",
      "Some of the National Guard members who visited Yakutat on Wednesday were also there in January 2022, when storms dumped about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow in a matter of days, damaging buildings.",
      "Operation Santa started in 1956 when flooding severely curtailed subsistence hunting for residents of St. Mary\u2019s, in western Alaska. Having to spend their money on food, they had little left for Christmas presents, so the military stepped in.",
      "This year, visits were planned to two other communities hit by flooding. Santa\u2019s visit to Circle, in northeastern Alaska, went off without a hitch. Severe weather prevented a visit to Crooked Creek, in the southwestern part of the state, but Christmas was saved when the gifts were delivered there Nov. 16.",
      "\u201cWe tend to visit rural communities where it is very isolated,\u201d said Jenni Ragland, service extension director with the Salvation Army Alaska Division. \u201cA lot of kids haven\u2019t traveled to big cities where we typically have Santa and big stores with Christmas gifts and Christmas trees, so we kind of bring the Christmas program on the road.\"",
      "After the C-17 Globemaster III landed in Yakutat, it quickly returned to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, an hour away, because there was nowhere to park it at the village's tiny airport. Later it returned to pick up the Christmas crew.",

To affirm their beliefs \u2014 that God is present and hasn\u2019t abandoned them \u2014 the faith community at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is embracing its holiday traditions just days after a deadly shooting there.",
      "\u201cWhen people say, \u2018Where is your God?\u2019 He is more evident now than he\u2019s ever been to us,\u201d the Rev. Sarah Karlen told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m sure the phrase \u2018Prince of Peace\u2019 and \u2018God with us\u2019 is going to be leaned into a little more this year.\u201d",
      "Karlen is a pastor at City Church, which in the late 1970s founded the school where she\u2019s also the theater teacher. This weekend, the church will hold the funeral of a 14-year-old student, Rubi Patricia Vergara, killed Monday when another student opened fire, also killing a teacher and wounding several others at the school on the same campus.",

      "Decked in holiday light displays, including Christmas trees and a Nativity scene, the evangelical, nondenominational church with over 1,200 members also hosted a vigil service Tuesday.",
      "Then, drawing from Scripture and particularly the Book of Job, pastors addressed the challenge of reconciling faith in a loving God with his allowing great suffering to occur.",
      "Karlen also challenged some of the taunts on the school\u2019s social media that questioned its religious beliefs. To the assembly\u2019s applause, she repeatedly affirmed God\u2019s presence in the midst of the grieving and the weariness.",
      "\u201cNone of us on our staff are saying that we understand why or how something happened. But we do understand that God sees us, sees things very differently than we do,\u201d Karlen said later.",
      "Police are continuing to investigate why Natalie \u201cSamantha\u201d Rupnow, 15, attacked the school before fatally shooting herself. While dozens of school shootings have happened across the U.S. in recent years, the vast majority are carried out by teenage boys and young men.",
      "Barbara Wiers said faith is helping teachers, students and families make peace with the possibility they will never have complete answers.",
      "\u201cThere may never be sense made out of this senseless tragedy. But. God, right? God understands, and God was there, and God is still here,\u201d said Wiers, the school\u2019s director for elementary education and communications. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not about man\u2019s judgment, although there\u2019s going to be all of that \u2014 because of the legal system and how that plays out. But God\u2019s just judgment will reign. And we trust him for that.\u201d",
      "The school remains closed as staff work to repair the physical damage so that it won\u2019t retraumatize teachers and students immediately upon their return, Wiers said. Safety and wellness protocols are also being reviewed.",
      "But on Christmas Eve, City Church plans to hold caroling and candlelight services, hoping that the community will draw comfort from the familiar traditions.",
      "\u201cWe know this is a long road for all of us, but the start is to be in the presence of God with one another, and to hug one another, and to sing together, to pray together,\u201d Karlen said.",
      "Other churches affiliated with the school, as well as the broader community in Madison, quickly came together to help, from alumni starting food drives to evangelical ministries sending chaplains to pastors sitting up with those hospitalized.",
      "\u201cHealing will come slowly, but they will not be left alone,\u201d said the Rev. Kerri Parker, executive director of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, whose member organizations include about 2,000 churches and 1 million Christians.",
      "Abundant Life Christian School is part of Impact Christian Schools, a network of private educational institutions that welcome families regardless of their creed, said Impact\u2019s executive director Chuck Moore.",
      "Moore said he hoped the shooting\u2019s occurrence so close to the holidays wouldn\u2019t forever tie Christmas with tragedy for the community.",
      "\u201cEven in the midst of awful, it\u2019s still a time we can rejoice,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe can focus our celebration on who Christ is.\u201d",
      "Already teachers at the school have talked about Jesus and faith in \u201cevery classroom, every subject, all day long, because God isn\u2019t siloed to Sunday,\u201d Wiers said. And that focus will continue when the school reopens sometime in January.",

He hasn\u2019t been altered at all,\u201d Wiers said. \u201cAnd the message hasn\u2019t changed. God is good. God is good all the time. He is faithful and he is true. And while we are brokenhearted, he\u2019s going to walk us through this.\u201d",

      "The park service said in a statement that the plan was was signed Thursday and will take effect in 180 days, barring any legal challenges. It will ban the tours over the park and within a half mile (800 meters) outside its boundary.",
      "\u201cProhibiting commercial air tours protects these lands\u2019 cultural and spiritual significance to the Navajo Nation,\u201d said park Superintendent Lyn Carranza. \u201cCanyon de Chelly National Monument\u2019s Air Tour Management Plan honors the unique nation-to-nation relationship regarding decisions affecting the park and helps to preserve one of the most important archeological landscapes in the southwest.\u201d",
      "The park lies within the Four Corners region inside the Navajo Nation and is among the most visited national monuments in the United States. It's known for its soaring sandstone cliffs and 800-foot (244-meter) high Spider Rock spire. Prehistoric rock art is found throughout the area, which has been home to Native Americans for millennia.",
      "The sightseeing flights reportedly date back to the 1930s, when crews building the Hoover Dam on the Arizona-Nevada border asked helicopter pilots working on the project to give flyovers to their families.",
      "The tours offering a unique overhead view of spectacular landscapes have long been popular at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. Some of the nation\u2019s busiest spots for tour operators have included Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is home to one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes, and Haleakala National Park.",
      "Supporters of the tours say they offer an exciting experience to tourists and allow older people and those with disabilities to see and enjoy the parks. Critics say the flights are an unnecessarily dangerous way to view some of the most stunning public lands in the United States.",
      "Rules designating routes and minimum altitudes were set in 1986 after two tour aircraft collided over the Grand Canyon, killing 25 people. Still, there are currently numerous options for helicopter tours to the Grand Canyon, departing from places including Las Vegas and Sedona, Arizona.",
      "Critics also complain that the buzz of helicopters drowns out the sounds of nature, disrupting the experiences of visitors on the ground and tribal members who call the land around the parks home.",
      "The park service works with the FAA to implement the National Park Air Tour Management Act of 2000, which requires tour operators who want to conduct such commercial air tours to get FAA approval. The law also requires the FAA, in conjunction with the park service, to establish management plans for air tours for those parks and nearby tribal lands where applications are made.",
      "Canyon de Chelly is the last of roughly two dozen national park units where the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility had fought for flyover restrictions. Other national parks where such commercial flyovers essentially are or will be banned in coming years include Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, Glacier National Park in Montana, and Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico. Only two air tours per year are allowed at Death Valley National Park along the California-Nevada border."

      "\u201cThe Coast Guard is keenly aware of and is aggressively responding to the unacceptable activities underpinning the report \u2014 namely sexual assault and sexual harassment,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Coast Guard is working proactively to prevent and reduce these devastating crimes, secure justice for survivors and provide the care and support victims need and deserve.\u201d",
      "Messages to officials at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, were not immediately returned Friday. The Coast Guard previously apologized for how it handled sexual misconduct complaints and said it has made numerous improvements.",
      "Operation Fouled Anchor ran from 2014 to 2019. The investigation reviewed more than 100 allegations of sexual assault at the academy made from the early 1990s to 2006 and how they were handled. Coast Guard officials, however, did not fully disclose its existence to Congress or the public until last year. The existence of the investigation was first reported by CNN.",
      "The investigation found that dozens of sexual assault and harassment cases involving academy cadets had been mishandled by the school, including the prevention of some perpetrators from being prosecuted.",
      "When the investigation did become public, it sparked calls for reform and accountability for offenders and those who protected them. They also resulted in multiple government investigations and formal complaints by more than 20 former cadets who said they were sexually assaulted.",
      "Friday's subcommittee report alleged that in 2018, Admiral Karl Schultz, the Coast Guard commandant at the time, made the decision to not publicly disclose Operation Foul Anchor, on the grounds that the investigation was not yet complete.",
      "That decision came after the vice commandant at the time, Admiral Charles Ray, who like Schultz has since retired, discussed the \u201cpros and cons of going external.\u201d",
      "The subcommittee said a handwritten note by Ray said the pros of disclosing the investigation publicly included \u201crip the band-aid off,\u201d being proactive and purging \u201ccultural guilt.\u201d The cons, Ray wrote, according to the congressional panel, included investigations without end and revictimizing people. Ray also wrote the \u201cproblem is one of the past,\u201d according to the subcommittee.",
      "Other Coast Guard officials presented three scenarios for how to handle Operation Fouled Anchor, with a recommendation to only discuss it if asked by Congress, the subcommittee said.",
      "The officials recommended against fully notifying Congress, writing that \u201cany affirmative Congressional or external communication, especially if briefed under a singular investigatory moniker with a colorful title, vice separate investigations, will risk the initiation of comprehensive Congressional investigations, hearings, and media interest,\u201d according to the subcommittee.",
      "Phone and text messages left at a listing for Schultz were not immediately returned Friday. Contact information for Ray could not immediately be found.",
      "Schultz told CNN in an interview last week that he withheld the investigation from Congress because he was concerned elected officials would not protect victims' privacy. He also denied allegations of a coverup and said he believed there was no legal obligation to give the investigation report to Congress.",
      "Schultz and Ray became the top leaders of the Coast Guard in 2018. The previous leaders told the subcommittee that they had intended to disclose Operation Foul Anchor to Congress and the public.",
      "Friday's report also said the Coast Guard drafted at least 17 versions of a final report for Operation Foul Anchor. The longest, at 26 pages, detailed assaults at the academy. The final version was six pages and omitted much of the information in earlier drafts, the subcommittee said.",
      "The subcommittee's report also accused Coast Guard officials of repeatedly failing to comply with the panel's investigation including by failing to produce documents, \u201caggressively\u201d redacting documents and erroneously claiming some documents were privileged.",
      "The Coast Guard responded that it has undergone an extensive effort to provide requested documents to Congress, including examining more than 1.8 million pages of emails, and has complied with congressional requests for information \u201cto the fullest extent.\u201d",
      "The Senate subcommittee said its investigation is continuing.",
      "\u201cWith the decision to keep Operation Fouled Anchor from Congress and the public, the Coast Guard failed itself and its members who survived sexual assault and sexual harassment during their time in the service,\u201d the subcommittee's report said."

      "Missouri\u2019s governor has commuted the sentence of a white Kansas City police officer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A white former Kansas City police officer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man was released from prison Friday after Missouri\u2019s governor commuted his sentence to parole.",
      "The decision by Republican Gov. Mike Parson to free Eric DeValkenaere came after months of public debate about the case, which had fueled both racial justice protests and impassioned pleas for mercy from DeValkenaere's supporters who asserted he had been unjustly convicted.",
      "DeValkenaere was serving a six-year prison sentence. He was convicted in 2021 of killing 26-year-old Cameron Lamb as he backed into his garage. Lamb\u2019s name was invoked frequently during racial injustice protests in Kansas City in 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Lamb\u2019s family even met with then-President Donald Trump that year.",
      "Parson did not pardon DeValkenaere but rather shortened his sentence to parole, subject to normal restrictions against possessing firearms, traveling out of state without permission and other items. He granted a similar commutation of parole to Patty Prewitt, another high-profile prisoner who had spent 40 years behind bars for her husband\u2019s killing.",
      "The Department of Corrections confirmed both were freed Friday afternoon, before Parson publicly announced his decisions. DeValkenaere had been held in an out-of-state prison for his own safety, said Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann.",
      "Jason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, which supports DeValkenaere, said they \u201cwill continue to fight to completely clear\u201d his name. Johnson said in a statement that DeValkenaere had an outstanding record of service, adding: \"While we strongly maintain that Eric is completely innocent, even those who do not must recognize that the ends of justice are not served by his incarceration.\u201d",
      "The clemency announcements came just weeks before Parson is to end his term, capping a historic string of such actions. Parson, a former rural sheriff, has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 800 people while clearing a backlog of more than 3,500 clemency requests he inherited upon taking office in June 2018. That's the most granted clemency cases of any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Most granted clemency had been convicted of lower-level crimes involving drugs or theft. But Parson also denied more than 3,000 clemency petitions.",
      "Gwendolyn Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, said the DeValkenaere clemency decision will tarnish Parson's legacy and \u201cwill fuel deeper divisions and ignite justified outrage.\"",
      "Grant called Parson's decision \u201cnothing short of a flagrant endorsement of systemic racism and a betrayal of justice. By freeing a convicted officer who unlawfully killed Cameron Lamb, a young Black man, the governor has made it crystal clear that Black lives do not matter in the state of Missouri under his leadership.\u201d",
      "At trial, DeValkenaere testified that he fired his weapon on Dec. 3, 2019, after Lamb pointed a gun at another detective, Troy Schwalm, and that he believed his actions saved his partner\u2019s life.",
      "Prosecutors, however, argued that police shouldn\u2019t have been on the property and staged the shooting scene to support their claims that Lamb was armed.",
      "\u201cDeValkenaere was convicted for killing an unarmed man. Period,\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a social media post Friday. \u201cHe was shown incredible mercy by the Governor. No such mercy was shown to the victims. Today we will focus our time caring for Cameron\u2019s family rather than commenting further.\u201d",
      "Messages left with attorneys for the Lamb family were not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Evidence presented during the trial, which was held without a jury at DeValkenaere\u2019s request, showed that DeValkenaere kicked over a barricade to get into Lamb's backyard.",
      "The trial judge, Dale Youngs, said the officers had no warrant for Lamb\u2019s arrest and had no search warrant or consent to be on the property. He called it a tragic case with troubling facts and said DeValkenaere and the officer with him escalated a situation that had been calmed. He didn\u2019t address allegations that evidence had been planted.",
      "DeValkenaere left the police force after his conviction but remained free on bond until he lost his appeal in October 2023. The Missouri Supreme Court subsequently declined to hear an appeal.",
      "DeValkenaere\u2019s wife, Sarah DeValkenaere, took to social media earlier this week \u2014 as she had done often \u2014 urging followers to request a pardon.",
      "\u201cI miss him so much,\u201d she said in a message on X in November. \u201cSo sad that an officer who dedicated his life to serving our city is now in prison for doing his job.\u201d",
      "Parson did not not offer an explanation for his clemency decisions while announcing them Friday. But he had previously acknowledged the pressure in an interview in August on KCMO Talk Radio.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a week that goes by that somebody\u2019s not reaching out to me about that issue, and we\u2019re going to see what happens here before long. I\u2019ll leave it at that. But you know, I don\u2019t like where he\u2019s at. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d Parson said.",
      "Prewitt, now 75, had filed multiple clemency requests over the years. She was serving a life sentence after being convicted of fatally shooting her husband, Bill Prewitt, in 1984 as he slept in their home in the rural east-central Missouri town of Holden.",
      "Prewitt, a mother of five, said a stranger broke into the house. She declined a plea deal that would have given her the chance for parole after five to seven years. Prosecutors said Prewitt cheated on her husband and her ex-lovers testified at trial in 1985 that she had talked about killing Bill Prewitt.",
      "But Patty Prewitt\u2019s backers argued that her relationship with her husband was improving and that the evidence of her infidelity would not be allowed in court today. In addition, Georgetown University law students examining the case found prosecutors failed to tell defense attorneys that two days after Prewitt\u2019s husband was killed, a neighbor told investigators she had seen a man parked at the end of a nearby dirt road in heavy rain on the night of the murder.",

      "A sheriff in rural, coastal Oregon says he's concerned about letters asking residents to collect information on immigrants",
      "LINCOLN CITY, Ore. -- A sheriff in Oregon says he has contacted the FBI and is increasingly concerned about a letter circulating in his rural, coastal community asking people to write down the license plate numbers of possible immigrants.",
      "The Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a news release on Thursday condemning the letters that have appeared across the county, describing them as divisive. Sheriff Curtis Landers told KPTV that he contacted federal authorities after receiving such a letter himself.",
      "The FBI said Friday it was aware of the mailings. In a statement, it encouraged community members who feel physically threatened to report their concerns to law enforcement.",
      "The letter tells the recipient to be on alert while sitting in their church parking lot or waiting in line to pick up their children at school, so as to write down the license plate numbers of cars believed to belong to immigrants who might lack permanent legal status.",
      "The sheriff's office said it was committed to upholding Oregon\u2019s sanctuary law, which prohibits local police in most cases from inquiring about an individual\u2019s immigration or citizenship status and sharing that information with federal authorities.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraging our community members to do the right thing and use compassion as we encounter these types of messages,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in its news release. \u201cWe strongly advise against engaging in activities such as those outlined in this letter, including collecting or sharing information about individuals based on their demographic or perceived immigration status.\u201d",
      "Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum similarly condemned the letters. \u201cAttempts to intimidate our communities and their leaders through racist letter writing campaigns has no place in Oregon, and we will continue to stand together in opposition to those who seek to divide us,\u201d she said in a statement Friday.",
      "The Associated Press emailed the sheriff\u2019s office on Friday, requesting comment and asking about the number and distribution method of the letters. When reached by phone, the sheriff\u2019s office said Landers and its spokesperson were both out of the office and unable to respond to calls or emails that day.",
      "Landers received a copy of the letter in his mailbox, according to KPTV. Elsewhere in the county, the mayor and city councilors of the small town of Toledo and the mayor of Lincoln City also received copies in the mail, KGW reported.",
      "In response to Trump\u2019s vows to conduct mass deportations during his second term, advocacy groups across the country have hosted know-your-rights trainings to teach immigrants how to protect themselves and their loved ones. The trainings are underway in immigrant-friendly states including California and Illinois \u2014 which both enacted protections for immigrants in response to Trump\u2019s focus on enforcement during his first administration \u2014 and those with more stringent laws affecting immigrants such as Florida.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in a growing number of Republican-led states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring recent laws in Texas and elsewhere that have been placed on hold while courts weigh whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal authority.",
      "Oregon became the first sanctuary state in 1987. Its law bars local and state police from participating in federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant, and also prohibits private immigration detention facilities from operating in the state.",
      "Oregon's sanctuary law has been updated and strengthened over the years, including in 2021, when the Legislature passed a measure creating a hotline for reporting violations of the law."

      "Minneapolis has softened an ordinance that prohibited obstructing entrances and driveways to abortion clinics after anti-abortion activists sued to challenge it on free-speech grounds",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minneapolis has softened an ordinance that prohibited the obstruction of entrances and driveways to abortion clinics after anti-abortion activists sued to challenge it on free-speech grounds.",
      "The City Council this month quietly amended the ordinance to exclude constitutionally protected activities and agreed to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees. Brian Gibson, chief executive officer of Pro-Life Action Ministries, said in an interview Friday that it amounted to an admission by the city that the law violated the freedom of speech.",
      "\u201cThey were accepting fault for having violated our constitutional rights,\u201d Gibson said.",
      "Pro-Life Action Ministries sends \u201csidewalk counselors\u201d to Planned Parenthood clinics in Minneapolis, St. Paul and elsewhere to try to dissuade people from having abortions. The ordinance, which the city enacted in 2022, was designed to protect patients of the Planned Parenthood clinic in the Uptown neighborhood from group members who would approach patients as they drove into the parking lot there. Gibson said they never blocked any entrances, but would try to get people to roll down their windows to take literature or talk.",
      "Minneapolis was the only city the state with such a rule. Gibson said their most immediate concern when they filed the lawsuit in 2023 was to overturn the Minneapolis ordinance, but he acknowledged that they also wanted to prevent St. Paul, where there's a much busier Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, from adopting something similar, which it never did.",
      "The final judgement in favor of Pro-Life Action Ministries and three of its sidewalk counselors was filed in federal court Thursday.",
      "Nationwide, several people have been convicted in the last year alone under the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, known as the FACE Act, or similar laws for physically blockading abortion clinic entrances. That includes activists in Detroit, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Mount Juliet, Tennessee, with some getting prison sentences as high as three to five years.",
      "Toward the end of a long meeting that dealt mostly with other topics on Dec. 5, the Minneapolis City Council went into closed session to approve the agreement on legal fees, then returned in a very brief open session to unanimously exempt \u201cany person or group engaging in conduct protected by the United States Constitution, the Minnesota Constitution or federal or Minnesota law.\u201d",
      "The law still prohibits physically blocking clinic entrances, and the city council's vice president, Aisha Chughtai, said it's consistent with the FACE Act.",
      "She said the council wants to make sure people have access to heath care, including abortions, and voiced support for Planned Parenthood.",
      "\u201cWe also want to be sure to provide very specific carveouts to ensure First Amendment rights are protected and ensure our local authority remains intact,\u201d she told her colleagues at the meeting.",
      "Chughtai did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday. In response to a request for comment from the city attorney's office, a city spokesperson supplied a statement that was nearly identical to what Chughtai said at the council meeting.",
      "\u201cThey amended their ordinance and repaired the damage that was done there. It was total victory for the free-speech folks,\u201d said Peter Breen, head of litigation for the conservative Thomas More Society, which represented the plaintiffs.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States, which was not a party to the lawsuit, said in a statement that under the revision, \u201cPatients continue to be protected from people blocking or obstructing the driveway or sidewalk.\u201d",
      "Breen said they\u2019ll file a bill for the attorney\u2019s fees soon, but that their last estimate was in the $600,000 range.",
      "The Thomas More Society and allied groups are litigating similar restrictions nationwide, Breen said. They\u2019ve asked a federal appeals court to block a similar ordinance in Clearwater, Florida. They\u2019re also fighting similar measures in Westchester County of New York, San Diego, and Detroit.",
      "And they\u2019ve asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a challenge to an ordinance in Carbondale, Illinois. While the Supreme Court in 2000 affirmed a Colorado buffer zone requirement in a case called Hill v. Colorado, Breen noted that the high court more recently in its Dobbs decision, which struck down the constitutional right to abortion, criticized the Hill decision, saying its previous abortion rulings \u201chave distorted First Amendment doctrines.\u201d",
      "Gibson said his members sometimes succeed in persuading people who come to the Minnesota clinics to cancel their abortions. He said they gather outside the St. Paul clinic nearly every day, and even go there Sundays when it's closed just to pray. And he said they had a victory on their first day back outside the Minneapolis clinic when they approached a woman who had parked on the street.",

    "story": [
      "In 2012, Elon Musk had just completed a business trip to London and Oxford. \"Just returned\u2026 I met with many interesting people,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I really like Britain!\"",
      "Fast-forward to 2024, and Musk's views on Britain are a little different.",
      "\"Civil war is inevitable\" \u2026 \"Britain is going full Stalin\"\u2026 \"The people of Britain have had enough of a tyrannical police state\".",
      "These are just some of his recent comments on X, as he renamed the site after he bought it.",
      "He has repeatedly got into spats with politicians including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, he has amplified voices on the right and far-right online and is in talks to donate to Reform UK, according to the party's leader Nigel Farage.",
      "So why has Musk's relationship with America's closest ally apparently soured and what, if anything, does he hope to achieve?",
      "We would love to ask him ourselves but he didn't respond to our requests for an interview.",
      "His X timeline offers some clues though.",
      "The self-proclaimed \"Chief Troll Officer\" often exaggerates in an ambiguous way, unclear if he's being sincere or ironic.",
      "When he writes, \"Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?\" he doesn't really mean that Britain is a totalitarian Communist state but also, he sort of does. Often he reposts content with just a single word - \"interesting\" - or an emoji, rather than going into details.",
      "In recent years, however, Musk watchers have noticed that the kinds of things he boosts to his 200 million followers tend to come from a particular place: a world view that is libertarian and \"anti-woke\", against progressives and centrists.",
      "'What's happening in the UK?'",
      "The shift was explicit during last summer's riots following the horrific killing of three girls at a dance class in the north-west England town of Southport.",
      "False rumours about the attacker were circulated on X, including by far-right accounts which had been unbanned since Musk took over the company two years before.",
      "As a protest turned violent and rioting flared, Sir Keir issued a warning: \"To large social media companies, and those who run them - violent disorder, clearly whipped up online, that is also a crime.",
      "\"It's happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere.\"",
      "Musk replied with one word: \"Insane\".",
      "Later, he would state that \"civil war is inevitable\" and spread a false message from the leader of a far-right party, claiming that Sir Keir was considering building detainment camps for rioters on the Falkland Islands. By the time he deleted the post, it had been viewed more than a million times.",
      "Musk also criticised Britain's \"prison overcrowding situation\" on Joe Rogan's podcast - watched 19m times on YouTube - saying we should \"make Orwell fiction again\", a reference to George Orwell's writings about dystopian society.",
      "While free speech is not Musk's only big issue - he appears to care a lot about existential questions around the future of humanity too - it's a subject that the Tesla, SpaceX and X owner has repeatedly returned to.",
      "Just a few weeks ago, in response to a tweet from a right-wing American influencer, making an exaggerated claim about a report from the last government on radicalisation, he commented: \"What is happening in the UK?\"",
      "And he may be planning to do more than tweet. He was recently pictured with Farage and Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy, amid reports he is preparing to donate a large sum of money to the party.",
      "Why Musk cares about Britain",
      "Musk's interest in UK affairs could be a reflection of how his own political beliefs have changed. He previously described himself as a centrist and even donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign, but now he talks a lot about the \"woke mind virus\".",
      "According to interviews he's given and a recent biography, the transition of one of his children from male to female - and that child, Vivian Wilson, subsequently cutting him off from her life - appears to be one of the key turning points.",
      "Winston Marshall, a former Mumford & Sons guitarist turned podcast host and right-leaning political commentator whose father jointly owns TV channel GB News, speculates that Musk could be picking fights because \"he cares very deeply about the UK\".",
      "\"Britain is the birthplace of liberal democracy, of many of the great philosophies that underpin America,\" Marshall says.",
      "\"So then he looks over to the UK and he sees what's been going on for several years, but which is now crescendoing after the August riots, with many, many people being given long jail sentences for literally Facebook memes in some cases.\"",
      "\"Facebook memes\" sounds pretty harmless but these examples include - for instance - a three-month jail sentence for a person who posted a meme along with the caption \"let's [expletive] riot\" on a Facebook group with \"riot/protest\" in the name during the Southport disorder.",
      "Some question whether the tycoon is really as committed to free speech as he claims.",
      "The Center for Countering Digital Hate, which scrutinises social media companies, was critical of Musk's tenure at X - prompting the tycoon to sue, accusing the organisation of misusing data and scaring off advertisers. The case was thrown out by a US judge.",
      "Its CEO Imran Ahmed called the incident \"indicative of the mindset of a man who simply cannot understand that freedom of speech is a freedom afforded to all, not just to him\".",
      "Other critics have pointed out that Musk has been careful not to criticise the president of China, a country where Tesla has huge business interests, despite Beijing's well-documented culture of censorship.",
      "He has far less at stake, business-wise, in Britain, but the country could still affect his bottom line via the Online Safety Act, passed by Parliament in late 2023. It will allow regulator Ofcom to issue huge fines to social media companies if they're found to have certain types of illegal content on their platforms.",
      "Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at Loughborough University, explains that while some provisions in the bill are uncontroversial, \"where it gets a bit more tricky is where this illegal content blurs across into what we might call the kinds of disinformation or misinformation that we see circulate on a daily basis on social media platforms\".",
      "This could include \"racially or religiously aggravated public order offences or the incitement of violence,\" he says.",
      "The Act comes with some potentially huge punishments \u2013 a fine of up to 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue.",
      "Could it be that Musk is worried about Britain biting off a chunk of X's revenues \u2013 or even, as the Act allows for in some circumstances, blocking access to the site in the UK?",
      "Defenders of the Act argue that it's got nothing to do with censoring free speech. Gawain Towler, former head of press for Reform UK, says while Musk might not have \"a forensic knowledge of all the details of backbench committee\" he does \"see the bigger picture\" \u2013 what Reform activists and others describe as a creeping culture of censorship.",
      "\"You don't have to concentrate always on the trees. And I think Musk sees the forest quite, quite well,\" he adds.",
      "Nobody can read the mind of the world's richest man.",
      "But it's clear that Musk has funnelled his vast wealth into influence and is now exporting his values \u2013 including a mainstream American view of free speech and largely unfettered capitalism \u2013 around the world.",

      "Government plans to limit the payment have, however, been criticised by some MPs, unions and charities.",
      "What is the winter fuel payment and how have the rules changed?",
      "The winter fuel payment was previously paid to all pensioners to help with energy costs during the coldest period of the year.",
      "But in July, the government said future payments in England and Wales would go only to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit.",
      "The changes mean that more than 10 million pensioners will not receive a payment for winter 2024.",
      "Several charities, unions and MPs criticised the decision to means-test the payment.",
      "They expressed concern about the number of older people living on a relatively small income who will miss out, and those who do not currently claim pension credit despite qualifying for it.",
      "The Unite union has asked the High Court for an urgent judicial review of the policy change. It says the government should have gathered more evidence on the impact of the cuts before announcing them.",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment worth?",

      "If you live with someone, and jointly claim benefits, only one of the couple receives the payment.",
      "How is the winter fuel payment linked to pension credit?",
      "Although the winter fuel payment is paid automatically, without a direct claim, the vast majority of those eligible will only receive the money if they have first registered to receive pension credit.",
      "This is a state pension top-up, which itself is worth thousands of pounds a year, and can be a gateway to other financial support, including a reduction in council tax, a free TV licence for those aged over 75, or help with NHS costs.",
      "However, an estimated 760,000 eligible pensioners fail to claim it.",
      "You could be eligible for pension credit if you are above state pension age and have an income of less that \u00a3218.15 a week, or less than \u00a3332.95 as a joint weekly income with your partner. Savings are also taken into account.",
      "Anyone entitled to pension credit for at least one day between 16 and 22 September 2024 will receive the winter fuel payment.",
      "Disabled people, those caring for someone, or those with housing costs could still be eligible even if they have additional income or savings.",
      "You can check your eligibility for pension credit via the government's online calculator.",
      "Information is also available on how to make a claim online.",
      "The final date to claim pension credit in time to get the 2024 winter fuel payment was 21 December.",

      "In mid-November, there was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims, with around 9,000 being cleared each week, according to the latest official figures.",
      "With a similar amount of new applications likely to have been made since then, there is a risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of 2024, according to analysis by BBC Verify.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "What will the rule change mean for the poorest pensioners?",
      "The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - about 15% - already live in relative poverty.",
      "This means their income is less than 60% of the median.",
      "The median income is the amount of money that divides a population into two, with half earning more, and half less.",

      "Asked about the figures, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said many pensioners would be better off from April 2025, when both the state pension and pension credit will increase by 4.1%, under \"the triple lock\" arrangement.",

      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",
      "Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.",
      "\"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.",
      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",
      "\"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over \u20ac1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.",
      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "The latest economic figures come after the Bank of England voted to hold interest rates on Thursday, stating it thought the UK economy had performed worse than expected, with no growth at all between October and December.",
      "The Bank downgraded its growth forecast from 0.3% for the final three months of 2024, to zero growth.",

      "Tulip Siddiq, 42, who as the Treasury's Economic Secretary is responsible for tackling corruption in UK financial markets, is alleged to have brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.",
      "The allegation is part of a wider investigation by Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) into Siddiq's aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed as prime minister of the country in August.",
      "A source close to Siddiq said these were \"trumped up charges\".",
      "The source also said the allegations were \"completely politically motivated\" and designed to damage her aunt.",
      "Conservative shadow home office minister Matt Vickers said: \"The fact Labour's anti-corruption minister is reportedly embroiled in a corruption case is the latest stain on Keir Starmer's judgement.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:29:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will make a key decision which could unlock compensation for millions of motorists.",
    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "But the higher Supreme Court has now agreed to hear an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also allowed motor finance providers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "The time period covers claims regarding leasing deals, as well as Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreements.",
      "The FCA also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision when it reconsiders the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, welcomed the extension.",
      "However, others have questioned whether it creates a further compensation delay for those who were mis-sold these agreements."

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",

      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",

    "summary": "Thanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.",
    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC speaks with parents who insist the school system is \"broken\" as latest government estimates point to a rise in home education.",
    "story": [
      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",
      "Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.",
      "Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter.",
      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",

      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",

At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",

      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 02:22:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The British actress has reunited with Mike Leigh for a film that could score her an Oscar nomination.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after being nominated for an Oscar, British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste is back in the awards race thanks to a tremendous performance in director Mike Leigh's new drama, Hard Truths.",
      "The 57-year-old jokes she feels \"older and wider\" (rather than wiser) this time around - a line she credits to co-star Michele Austin, who plays her on-screen sister.",
      "But waistlines aside, her reunion with Leigh, whom she first worked with on 1996's Secrets & Lies, has prompted some of the most positive reviews of her career.",
      "Hard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who is constantly grumpy and miserable, and the impact her unspoken depression has on those around her.",
      "It would be unfair to call the film a comeback for Jean-Baptiste, because she has been working tirelessly in the intervening years. But her second collaboration with Leigh has led to renewed attention on the film awards circuit.",
      "\"It's kind of a full circle moment, rather than a comeback,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"It's very interesting, because the first time, I was not aware at all that we were even in an Oscar race. You've got to remember, in 1996, there was still a huge independent film presence in the United States.",
      "\"At that time, we weren't that aware of the whole Oscar thing. It was something that happened over there,\" she says, gesturing far away, \"with really big stars. So it really was not on our radar.\"",
      "Having won the top prize at Cannes, it was only when Secrets & Lies played at the New York Film Festival four months later that Jean-Baptiste became more aware of the awards buzz. \"I hadn't even heard of the Golden Globes at that point,\" she recalls.",
      "\"We were just talking about the film, doing loads of interviews, we were just knackered from all the plane rides, so there was a naivety to it the first time.",
      "\"Now we have the internet and it's become more of an aggressive pursuit of those awards. The campaigning process has changed quite a lot. Or maybe it hasn't and we just weren't aware of it back then.\"",
      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",
      "Older and wider, we all begrudgingly are. But Marianne Jean-Baptiste is clearly quite a lot wiser, too.",

      "Corenswet has taken ownership of the cape, though, and is seen in the trailer saving a girl from an explosion, smashing out of a glass cabinet and kissing Lois in mid-air.",
      "He also has a rock hurled at his head by a member of an angry crowd as he walks into a Stagg Industries building, and his Clark Kent alter-ego is seen in the Daily Planet newspaper office and with Pa Kent (played by Pruitt Taylor Vince) in rural Kansas.",

      "David A Gross, who writes the FranchiseRe box office newsletter, said a result like Kraven's was \"the new normal for superhero films\" because \"nothing is working outside of well established stories\".",
      "Four superhero films were released in 2024 and there will be another four in 2025 - down from seven before the pandemic, he said.",
      "\"The Superman story has the history and pedigree to be a hit in today's market,\" he told BBC News. \"It's a 'classic' and will be taken seriously by both superhero fanatics and broader fans.",
      "\"James Gunn knows what he's doing and gives the project total credibility. With this kind of story, casting is changeable, and in this case the new cast is a plus - it's part of updating the story.",
      "\"Nothing is a given now for the superhero genre, but Superman should do very well, and these films are strong around the world.\"",

      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",
      "\"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

    "story": [
      "The mother of a young girl operated on by a disgraced surgeon at a famous London children's hospital said she should never have been left in his care.",
      "Jodee Seeley told BBC Newsnight she was considering legal action after Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh), whom she accuses of \"gaslighting\" her, allowed Yaser Jabbar to operate on her daughter Alana even when complaints had been raised about his misconduct.",
      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a Royal College of Surgeons inquiry found he had performed \"incorrect\" or \"inappropriate\" surgery in several cases.",
      "A spokesperson for Gosh said it understood \"why Alana and her family are worried\"  and apologised that \"they feel information was withheld from them\".",
      "Mr Jabbar had operated on Jodee's daughter in 2022, when she was eight years old, fitting metal plates into her knees for leg lengthening and straightening.",
      "He was a leading surgeon at the renowned hospital, operating on children with complicated disorders and carrying out procedures, such as the one undergone by Alana, who has a complex chromosome abnormality.",
      "The hospital has since initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients to conclude what level of harm they had experienced.",
      "Some cases linked to Mr Jabbar resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Jodee, from Essex, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that she had no idea of the doctor's reputation when her daughter Alana was referred to his care in 2021.",
      "At that point, concerns had already been raised about Mr Jabbar.",
      "She said that at the family's first consultation in March 2021, which lasted \"about five minutes\", Mr Jabbar had advised the invasive surgery.",
      "\"We didn't want to rock the boat too much because he seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing,\" she said.",
      "\"So we kind of went along with it thinking he's an orthopaedic surgeon, it's Great Ormond Street [Hospital]. We trusted him.\"",
      "She said she was told the surgery would improve Alana's mobility and put her \"knee into place... and then from there we could assess whether anything else needed to be done\".",
      "The operation took place 10 months later, in January 2022. During that period, more professional complaints from other surgeons were raised with the managers at the hospital.",
      "None of this was ever disclosed to Jodee or other families of Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "She said the surgery had appeared to go well and, with Alana's leg bandaged up, there had not seemed to be any immediate problems.",
      "But when the bandage came off a few weeks later, Jodee saw two scars instead of one on the inside of her child's leg when they had been told it would be just one incision.",
      "\"The alarm bells rang at that point,\" she said.",
      "As weeks went by, the mobility of Alana, now aged 11, was not improving and she was reporting pain frequently, often needing painkillers.",
      "Jodee said she had thought at first: \"Well, maybe it just hasn't worked? Maybe that wasn't the right procedure and it will be removed? Or maybe it's just too early to tell?\"",
      "She said she had expected regular check-ups from the hospital but a follow-up appointment did not come until July - six months after the operation.",
      "The plates in Alana's knees were supposed to be there for about two years and Jodee says another surgeon at the hospital recommended keeping the plates in place at the follow-up appointment.",
      "Then, by chance, they saw Mr Jabbar on the same visit.",
      "Jodee said he took one look and said they \"needed to come out immediately\" and asked the family to return the following day for another major operation.",
      "He told the family he was worried Alana's tendons could re-fuse to the metal plates, Jodee said.",
      "\"We were really panicked, we were really worried.... [thinking] 'What have we done, is she okay, is it long-term damage?'\"",
      "They returned to the hospital in August 2022 to have the plates removed.",
      "But the family's concern was now so strong that they moved Alana to a different hospital months after.",
      "Jodee said her daughter's mobility was now \"worse\" and that she was \"still having falls\".",
      "Jodee said she was not informed of anything wrong with Mr Jabbar's work until February this year, more than 16 months on.",
      "She said the hospital informed her only in a brief letter with few details.",
      "\"It seemed like quite a general letter... nothing to worry about,\" she said.",
      "She did not realise the extent of Mr Jabbar's reported misconduct until media reports.",
      "\"I did not realise the scale of it or what actually happened or that there had been so many complaints,\" she added.",
      "\"I just felt sick, to be honest,\" she said. \"So obviously devastated. As a parent, obviously you want to protect your child, it is the number one priority. And I knew something was amiss when we had seen him.\"",
      "Jodee said her daughter should never have been put under the surgeon's care and has accused the hospital of a culture of complicity.",
      "She told the BBC she had heard from the hospital immediately prior to talking to reporters.",
      "She said this could be a coincidence or \"they've been pushed to do that because they were aware that I'd be coming to talk to you today\".",
      "\"It does actually feel like they've been gaslighting the whole way,\" she added.",
      "Jodee said she and her family were very private but she had felt compelled to speak out so other victims could know they are \"not alone\".",
      "\"It's really important for other people to know what's happened and to understand if they're being gaslighted as well, that they're not alone, that this is what's going on,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for the hospital said it was sorry to all concerned families, adding that after the Royal College of Surgeons report, it had asked external experts to review all Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "The statement goes on: \"They are working at pace [...]  We understand why Alana and her family are worried [...] and we have reached out to them.",
      "\"We are sorry they feel that information was withheld from them. Once concerns were raised about the surgeon's practice in June 2022, we shared these with the General Medical Council and undertook rapid fact-finding. During this period the surgeon's practice was restricted to simple procedures [...] and always as part of a wider surgical team.",
      "\"We then had to establish the facts before sharing information with patients.",
      "\"We are now updating patients regularly about the progress of the review.",
      "\"We are aware there were concerns regarding specific patients in 2021 that were raised as formal incidents and were fully investigated. The findings in each individual case and collectively did not trigger the threshold for initiating further action at that time.\"",
      "Great Ormond Street's actions in the wake of Mr Jabbar's departure have continued to come under fire.",
      "This year the hospital has initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients, to conclude what level of harm they experienced.",
      "But families who have received the results in recent weeks have called the reviews a mis-representation and a \"whitewash\" of what their children experienced.",
      "Parents have told the BBC how the hospital \"failed their children\", leaving them physically and mentally damaged.",
      "The BBC has spoken to at least four families - and had indirect contact with 12 more - who say the reports do not reflect their children's experiences or minimise their pain and suffering.",
      "The reviews, carried out by specialist surgeons who did not work at GOSH, were based on patient notes provided by the hospital.",
      "Many of the reports were also made without any interviews with the patient or their family.",

      "\"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said.",
      "\"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\"",
      "Dr Duffy says that - perhaps due to its name - players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions.",
      "\"It's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way,\" she says. \"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder.\"",
      "She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",
      "During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are then \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said.",
      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.",
      "The therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said.",
      "Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions.",
      "\"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\"",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",
      "But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments.",
      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "In another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

      "The Lib Dems are calling for this deadline to be extended to 28 February and for applications to be processed quicker, to ensure vulnerable pensioners do not miss out.",
      "Previously all pensioners got the payment to help with energy costs, worth between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300.",
      "But in July the government said future payments in England and Wales would only go to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit, meaning more than 10 million people will no longer be eligible.",

      "Trump had once called Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage a \"great choice\" for ambassador - but Labour were unlikely to choose a political opponent such as Farage.",

      "\"You've got to be pragmatic, practical about this,\" he said.",

      "Ministers argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally, but it has prompted a backlash from the County Councils Network, which represents large county authorities.",

      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",
      "The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed.",
      "In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000.",
      "However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then.",
      "BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November.",
      "The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment.",
      "In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it.",
      "After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people.",
      "However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.",

    "summary": "From fears of an election wipeout to bouncing back with the budget, John Swinney reflects on a chaotic 2024.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",

      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",

      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",

      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",

    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 03:20:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change could increase flood threats without improvements to defences, the Environment Agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",
      "Earlier this year, a cross-party committee of MPs warned that the government had not maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones. A lack of funding has been a key issue.",
      "In response to today's report, Floods Minister Emma Hardy acknowledged that \"too many communities are exposed to the dangers of flooding\".",
      "\"That is why we have committed \u00a32.4 billion over the next two years to maintain, repair and build flood defences to protect communities across the country,\" she said.",

      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",
      "Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers \"shelling out more money\" on multiple subscription services.",
      "It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans.",
      "Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services.",

      "So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals.",

      "\"We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,\" she told the BBC.",

      "And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed.",
      "\"As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Wattan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",
      "\"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:05:06 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can spot patterns in the data from blood tests that can give an early warning of disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the third feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.",
      "And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.",
      "Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.",
      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",
      "These included blood from people with other forms of cancer, or other gynaecological disease that might be confused with ovarian cancer.",
      "More AI and Medicine",
      "More AI and Medicine",
      "A big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare, which limits the data for training algorithms.",
      "And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers.",
      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",
      "Dr Heller says this may be \"three to five years\" away.",
      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",
      "One challenge is that researchers don\u2019t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases.",
      "Over the last two years Dr Slav\u00e9 Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%.",
      "Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do.",
      "\u201cThese are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,\u201d says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.",
      "Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer.",
      "\"We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,\" he says.",
      "More broadly data, or the lack of it, is still a drawback.",
      "\"People aren't sharing their data, or there's not a mechanism to do it,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "Ocra is funding a large-scale patient registry, with electronic medical records of patients who've allowed researchers to train algorithms on their data.",

      "Alawites controlled power in the predominantly Sunni Muslim country for the 50 years of the Assad family's rule, holding top positions in the government, military and intelligence services.",
      "Now, many from the community fear reprisals following the overthrow of the Assad regime by rebels led by HTS, a Sunni Islamist group that was once al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.",

      "In Mezzeh 86, the presence of HTS fighters at a checkpoint did not appear to be a source of anxiety.",
      "Many Alawites did come up and speak with us - keen to distance themselves from Assad's regime.",

      "\"Those who were in the military and did bad things have fled. No-one knows where they are. They are afraid of revenge,\" said Thaier Shaheen, a construction worker.",
      "\"But people who don't have blood on their hands, they are not scared, and have stayed back.\"",
      "There have been reports of a few reprisal killings in parts of the country, but so far there is no evidence to suggest they were carried out by HTS.",
      "\"Until now, we are OK. We are talking to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and they are respectful. But there are people who aren't from HTS but pretend to be them who are making threats. They want our society to fail and they are the ones we are scared of,\" said Mohammad.",
      "After taking control of Damascus, HTS and its allies said those from the deposed regime who had been involved in torture and killings would be held to account, although it is unclear so far what form that justice will take.",
      "HTS also said that the rights and freedoms of religious and ethnic minorities would be protected.",
      "The group has a jihadist past which it has distanced itself from. But it has an Islamist present, and many are asking what that will mean for Syria's plural society.",
      "\"I'm so happy because the Assad regime fell. This is like a dream come true. No-one wants to live under dictatorship. But there is concern. I have to be realistic,\" said Youssef Sabbagh, a Christian lawyer.",

      "At a restaurant in the Old City, we met lawyer Ouday al-Khayat, who is a Shia Muslim.",
      "\"There's no doubt that there's anticipation and anxiety. The signs that come from HTS are good, but we must wait and watch,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not possible to know the opinions of all Shia but there is a concern about a scenario similar to Libya or Iraq. I believe, though, that Syria is different. Syrian society has been diverse for a very long time.\"",
      "We drove around 110km (70 miles) south-east of Damascus, through black volcanic hills, to the city of Suweida, which is home to most of Syria's Druze population.",

      "Activist Wajiha al-Hajjar believes that the protests were not brutally cracked down on like others in Syria, because Assad wanted to show the world and his foreign allies that he was protecting minorities.",
      "\"They did try to suppress our protest but in a different way - not through weapons or shelling, but by depriving us of passports and civil rights, and access to official documents. It became difficult to leave Suweida and a kind of siege was imposed,\" she said.",
      "Hundreds still gather at the square every day. When we visited, there was an air of celebration. Songs were blaring on a loudspeaker, and young girls and boys were doing a gymnastics performance, their families clapping and cheering for them.",
      "\"We are celebrating the fall of the regime, but this gathering is also a show of strength. In the event that there is an extreme regime with extreme laws, we are prepared to stay in this square and demand our rights and demand equality,\" Wajiha said.",
      "Suweida had a quasi-autonomous status under Assad, and the Druze want that to continue.",

    "story": [
      "Jamil Hassan, one of the most feared men in Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, wanted for the torture and killing of civilians, was shaking as he walked down the stairs of his apartment block.",
      "Outside, the 72-year-old climbed into a car in a small convoy with his family and a handful of security guards, just a few suitcases between them.",
      "His neighbour and her teenage son watched.",
      "\"I knew the moment I saw them flee that Assad had fallen,\" she says.",
      "When we entered Hassan's apartment a few days later, signs of the family's hasty departure were everywhere.",
      "In the fridge was a half-eaten carrot cake with a knife still on the plate. The beds were strewn with clothes and empty shoeboxes. Flowers wilted in a vase in the dining room, and cups and plates had been left to dry by the sink.",
      "A framed photo of a smiling Hassan and Assad hung on the wall of the study, with text reading: \"Our skies are for us and forbidden to others\".",
      "Hassan, referred to as \"the butcher\" by many civilians on his street, was one of Assad's most menacing enforcers. He led the Air Force Intelligence and oversaw a network of detention facilities including the notorious Mezzeh Prison, where detainees were routinely tortured.",
      "He is one of many senior regime figures wanted or sanctioned around the world who have abandoned their homes in affluent areas of Damascus and vanished.",
      "Finding these men who ruled Syria with an iron fist will be difficult. Some fear they will strike political deals abroad and evade justice.",
      "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the campaign to topple the regime, has vowed to search for them inside Syria. Rebels aligned with the group now occupy Hassan's apartment and a handwritten note on the front door warns people not to enter.",
      "When we asked them where Hassan might have gone, one grinned and replied: \"I don't know - to Hell.\"",
      "'His guards threatened to kill my dog'",
      "Many apartment shutters on Hassan's quiet street in central Damascus are now closed. Knocks on doors go unanswered.",
      "Those who will speak tell us about their fear at living on a street with a wanted war criminal. \"We were so afraid to talk,\" says the woman who watched him flee. \"It was terrifying to live next to them.\"",
      "Hassan is wanted in the US for \"engaging in conspiracy to commit cruel and inhuman treatment of civilian detainees, including US citizens\". He was convicted in absentia earlier this year in France for his role in imprisoning, disappearing and torturing two Syrian-French nationals. Germany wants him too. An Interpol Red Notice shows a photograph of Hassan alongside a note that he is wanted for \"conspiracy to commit war crimes\".",
      "He was placed under travel bans and had his assets frozen over the repression of civilian protesters. In April 2011 the US says Air Force Intelligence personnel fired tear gas and live ammunition at protesting crowds in Damascus and other cities, killing at least 43.",
      "People on the street describe a formidable figure who was unapproachable and always surrounded by guards.",
      "A makeshift security post outside Hassan's apartment building was constantly staffed by military personnel. The night before the regime collapsed, the men simply took off their uniforms and discarded their weapons, according to another neighbour.",
      "\"It was the first time I'd seen this post with no lights, no sounds, no noise,\" says 27-year-old Amr al-Bakri, a filmmaker who lives with his family in the building next door.",
      "He said locals \"knew what he did to the Syrians - outside of Damascus and in Damascus - so we know it but we can't say anything, just 'good morning sir'. He'd say nothing back.\"",
      "Amr says his family had to give away their pet dog after Hassan's guards threatened to kill it if it didn't stop barking. When Amr's family asked for the guard post to be moved from outside their home, they were told they should move house instead, he says.",
      "The guards would run regular inspections on the street and check the bags of visitors.",
      "\"Sometimes if I had a plumber or handyman to come and fix something one of the guards would come and check if there was really something that needed to be fixed,\" says the woman living in Hassan's building.",
      "Neighbours also say Hassan had a \"golden line\" for electricity that meant his family's lights were always on, while other homes in the neighbourhood were in darkness.",
      "The electrician called to fix any problems at the apartment says he knew Hassan over many years \"but only from a distance\". \"[Hassan] was very strict - a military personality,\" the man says. \"He was a butcher\u2026 He had no mercy.\"",
      "The man told BBC News he had been in prison - not at Mezzeh but elsewhere - and was tortured there.",
      "A local shopkeeper, Mohammed Naoura, says he didn't like Hassan but that you had to appear to support him.",
      "\"We are happy now,\" he adds. \"Nobody believed this would ever happen.\"",
      "Guns on sofas and underground swimming pools",
      "Hussam Luka, head of the General Security Directorate (GSD), was less well-known among residents but had an apartment underneath Hassan.",
      "His \"ruthless, smooth-talking nature\" reportedly earned him the nickname \"the spider\" - and he's under sanctions in the EU, US and UK.",
      "A UK sanctions list says he was \"responsible for the torture of opponents in custody\", while the US Treasury Department says he \"reportedly committed a number of massacres\" while working in Homs.",
      "The White House has said he is one of a small group of officials who might have information about missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "At his home on Monday, rebels were dismantling furniture to be put into storage. They said they arrived after looters had already taken many of the most expensive items.",
      "A photo of Luka and Assad remained, printed in different sizes and styles, alongside documents from security and intelligence events, and ceremonial medals and certificates from the foreign spy service in Russia - where the deposed Syrian leader Assad has fled.",
      "\"This award is to the coordinator of the mukhabarat [intelligence service] organ in the southern provinces of the Syrian Arab Republic,\" one certificate naming Luka says. \"You showed the utmost professionalism and put in huge effort to fulfil the duties entrusted to you for the good of the Syrian people.\"",
      "As rebels clear the apartment, a neighbour wanders in to see what's happening.",
      "When asked what she knows about the regime official, she replies: \"We keep to ourselves, they keep to themselves. No one in this building interacts with each other.\" She walks away.",
      "What lies ahead for Assad and his family?",
      "Assad says he didn't intend to leave Syria, statement claims",
      "Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa",
      "In other affluent areas more homes have been abandoned. Fridges are fully stocked, wardrobes full and in some cases travel documents left behind.",
      "The rebels who have taken over the homes are using them as bases, and say they are also preventing further looting.",
      "At one lavish apartment, men say they are sleeping on blankets on marble floors beneath giant chandeliers and cooking on a camp stove in its modern kitchen. Guns are propped against plush sofas and arm chairs.",
      "\"We don't need any of this,\" a rebel says, gesticulating around the room.",
      "At another, a child peeks through the curtain of a sprawling ground-floor apartment with an outdoor swimming pool. A large family say they are occupying the space.",
      "Perhaps the grandest home in the area is the modern labyrinthine underground dwelling of one of the country's best-known businessmen - Khodr Taher Bin Ali, better known as Abu Ali Khodr.",
      "Bin Ali has been sanctioned by the US, UK and EU for his role in supporting and benefiting from the Syrian regime.",
      "His home has a lift, a full-size gym, an indoor swimming pool, hot tub and sauna, and an industrial kitchen.",
      "In the master bedroom, there are two golden safes, with space for dozens of watches - in a drawer there is a forgotten warranty card for luxury brand Audemars Piguet. A gun case and jewellery boxes in the wardrobe are empty.",
      "The children's ensuite bedrooms still have toys and a Louis Vuitton handbag on the floor and homework and school reports are in the cupboards. A Quran rests on a work top with the words \"A gift from the president Bashar al-Assad\" inscribed on the side.",
      "Around the corner from Bin Ali is the home of Ali Mamlouk, one of Assad's closest associates and among the most senior and notorious members of the regime. He was reportedly given the nickname \"black box\" because of his control over sensitive information.",
      "He was sentenced alongside Hassan by French judges this year for war crimes, and is also wanted in Lebanon for two explosions in 2012 in the city of Tripoli that killed and wounded dozens.",
      "Like Luka, the White House believes Mamlouk is one of few men who could have information about Tice.",
      "His home is padlocked shut, and rebels are more reluctant to grant entry there.",
      "In a guard booth outside, there are notes on visitors to the property before Assad's fall - people delivering chocolates, water and vegetables, and coming to fix the electricity.",
      "\"No one could see, no one could walk, no one could pass by this area. It's actually the first time I'm seeing this place from up close,\" says 17-year-old Mo Rasmi Taftaf, whose family own a house nearby.",
      "\"Whenever he came in or out, guards would cut the roads off,\" one neighbour says.",
      "Shouting down from a second-floor balcony, another gestures towards Mamlouk's large home when asked about the wanted regime figure.",
      "\"It felt like there was a strange atmosphere\" on the street the night before news broke that Assad had fled, he says, without elaborating.",
      "\"His security was here at the time but I saw them leave on Sunday morning - a lot of cars. Ali Mamlouk wasn't here,\" he adds, before returning inside.",
      "Another man, who declines to give his name, says he doesn't want to talk about the regime men.",

      "Many, though, do want justice.",
      "The leader of HTS has vowed to pursue the senior regime figures in Syria and asked other countries to hand over those who fled. Those wanted elsewhere have limited places to run.",
      "Finding the men will be a challenge.",
      "\"While there is no confirmed information on the current whereabouts of senior regime figures like Jamil Hassan, Ali Mamlouk, and others, there are concerns that such individuals could benefit from political deals that enable them to evade justice,\" the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) tells the BBC.",
      "\"Some are likely to have sought refuge in allied countries, complicating future extradition efforts, while others may still be in Syria, living discreetly.\"",
      "On Hassan's street, neighbours speculate about where the vanished war criminal has gone.",
      "His family left few clues in the apartment. But in the office is a certificate for Hassan's daughter signed by Hassan Nasrallah, the late leader of Lebanon-based Shia militant group Hezbollah, thanking her for her \"help and support for this honourable resistance\".",
      "Several neighbours suggest he may be hiding in Lebanon or has transited through there, while the local shopkeeper says he thinks Hassan headed for the coast, perhaps to Latakia in the north - the heartland of the minority Alawite sect to which Assad and many of his closest allies belong.",
      "Meanwhile, Lebanese newspaper Nida al-Watan reports that Mamlouk was smuggled across the border and into the Lebanese capital Beirut by Hezbollah - a long-time ally of Syria's Ba'ath government.",
      "Hezbollah has not confirmed offering assistance to any regime figures, and the Lebanese government has said no Syrian officials targeted by international warrants were authorised to enter through legal crossings. Lebanese security services say Mamlouk is not in the country.",
      "Syrian-British barrister Ibrahim Olabi says regime officials may have acquired new identities and passports, as they were powerful people backed by state institutions.",
      "When it comes to getting justice, he adds, a lack of evidence is not the problem. It is more about finding them and getting them to a place where they can be held accountable.",
      "The SCM says doing this will \"require considerable resources, sustained political will, and international collaboration\".",
      "Failing to do so will send a \"dangerous message that crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, can go unpunished\", it adds.",
      "Ibrahim Olabi says he is hopeful that justice will be served.",
      "\"It will absolutely be a hunt,\" he says, but \"the world now is a small place through social media, private investigators, political leverages\".",

    "story": [
      "The US government has enacted a budget to avert shutting itself down, but the bitterly disputed deal doesn't include a call from President-elect Donald Trump to increase the federal borrowing limit.",
      "US President Joe Biden signed the spending bill into law on Saturday morning. The Senate passed the agreement shortly after a midnight deadline by 85-11. The House of Representatives approved it hours earlier by 336-34.",
      "Without a funding deal, millions of federal employees would have ended up either on temporary unpaid leave or working without pay.",
      "US government debt stands at about $36 trillion (\u00a329tn), with more money now being spent just on the interest payments than on US national security.",

      "Lawmakers earlier this week successfully negotiated a deal to fund government agencies, but it fell apart after Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk called on Republicans to reject it.",
      "The last government shutdown was during Trump's first presidential term in 2019 and lasted 35 days - the longest in US history.",
      "The American Relief Act, 2025 that just passed is 118 pages, stripped down from\u00a0a 1,547-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected this week. It will fund the US government at current levels until 14 March.",
      "Trump's call to lift the debt ceiling - which was a sticking point for Democrats and some Republican budget hawks -  was not included in the final bill, but Republican leaders said that measure would be debated in the new year.",
      "The dramatic budget fight is a preview of the legislative fights that may lie in store when Trump takes office next month.",
      "\"Trying to jam a debt ceiling suspension into the legislation at the 11th hour was not sustainable,\" House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote.",
      "He later praised the bill's passage, saying: \"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club.\"",
      "The deal removes measures sought by Democrats in the first version of the bill, including the first pay rise for lawmakers since 2009, healthcare reforms, and provisions aimed at preventing hotels and live event venues from deceptive advertising.",
      "It does include $100bn in disaster relief funds to help with hurricane recovery and other natural disasters, and allocates $10bn in aid to farmers.",
      "It also includes full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when it was struck by a cargo ship in March.",
      "Musk, who Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his administration, had lobbied heavily against the earlier version of the bill.",
      "During the debate, Republicans said they looked forward to a \"new era\" with Trump taking office on 20 January and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress. Currently, the Senate remains under Democratic control.",
      "The budget wrangling left Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson bruised as he faced criticism from members of his own party, raising a question mark over whether he can win a 3 January vote in the chamber to keep his job.",

      "This is the Ozo running club, formed by Igbo people to celebrate the culture of one of the largest of Nigeria's more than 300 ethnic groups.",
      "\"We wanted to create a space where young Igbo people could connect and re-connect to their culture,\" said Chibueze Odoemene, who co-founded the club with Emeka Atumonyogo, and Chigo Ogbonna.",
      "In less than three months, the Ozo running club already has more than 300 members.",
      "This rapid growth speaks not only to the deep desire for community, but to the significant boom of social running clubs in recent years.",
      "Strava, the popular running app, said there had been a 59% increase in running club participation globally this year.",
      "But for the Ozo running club, the weekly Saturday meets aren't simply about running, pace or fitness - it's a place where strangers become family.",
      "Even as the runners wait to join their respective speed groups - fast, medium, slow, and walking pace - a buzz and energy cuts through the calm of the park as Afrobeats music pulses from a nearby speaker.",
      "\u201cIgbo kwenu!\u201d shouts Mr Odoemene, his voice booming across the park to gather everyone\u2019s attention.",
      "The group responds in unison with a low, rumbling \u201cEyy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgbo kwezo!\u201d he calls out again, his tone both commanding and warm.",
      "Once more, a unified \u201cEyy\u201d follows, resonating among the runners and setting the tone for the morning.",
      "This traditional Igbo call-and-response is more than a greeting - it\u2019s a moment of pride, a reminder of shared roots and identity that runs as deep as their commitment to each other and the weekly run.",
      "\u201cThe chant is used as a call of unity, community, and love among all Igbo peoples,\u201d said Mr Odoemene.",
      "Running clubs like Ozo, which are often free, have become spaces for people to make new friends, create a community, and possibly even meet future partners.",
      "The co-founders, who met at other Igbo social events, laugh at the prospect of a love story blossoming at their club.",
      "\u201cIf people meet the love of their lives, that's amazing, but the most important part for us is to build a fun community,\u201d said Mr Odoemene.",
      "For Francesca Ngozi Ezennolim, 21, the prospect of romance is not what brought her all the way from Reading, about 64km (40 miles) from London, on a Saturday morning, but the promise of community.",
      "\u201cI don't have a lot of Igbo friends,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI do have a lot of Nigerian friends - but it's hard to find Igbo friends.\u201d",
      "Donning a black athletic outfit, she told the BBC she hopes the running club will fill that hole in her life.",
      "And she is not alone.",
      "A first-timer to the club, Jennifer Iwuamadi, 23, echoed the same sentiments.",
      "\u201cIt's so important to come to an Igbo run club because we get to socialise with our brothers and sisters. It's a great way to get fit and network,\u201d she said.",
      "Although the Igbos are one of Nigeria's largest ethnic groups and are prominent in the diaspora, many feel their culture is under threat. In 2006, the United Nations cultural organisation (Unesco) predicted that the Igbo language would become extinct by 2025.",
      "However, in the UK, their numbers have risen over the last decade - from around 8,000 to 11,000, according to the Office for National Statistics.",

      "In contrast, speakers of Yoruba, the other main language in southern Nigeria, have declined from 15,000 to 10,000 over the same period.",
      "Nevertheless, some young Igbo people told the BBC they have struggled to make friends outside their parents' community.",
      "\u201cI have so many Yoruba friends, but I want to meet people from my tribe,\u201d Ms Ezennolim told the BBC.",
      "\u201cWhen people think about Nigerians, they don't really think about Igbo. Nigeria is not just one piece, it's multiple pieces,\u201d said Mr Odoemene.",
      "But isn't it divisive to have a running club which focuses on Igbo culture?",
      "The founders vehemently shake their heads.",
      "\"You don't have to be Igbo to come to the run club,\" said Mr Atumonyogo.",
      "He adds that people from Iran, Italy, and the Caribbean have come to their sessions - and they encourage others to join in, learn about Igbo culture, ask questions, and immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere.",
      "Yet, beneath the joy and camaraderie, there is a darker side to the Igbo story.",
      "In Nigeria, many people still associate the Igbos with the 1967-70 Biafran war, which left some one million people dead after Igbo leaders in the south-east led a campaign to secede from the rest of the country.",

      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "In his book The Trouble with Nigeria, the late Chinua Achebe, one of the most renowned Nigerian authors, who was Igbo, said: \"Nigerians will probably achieve consensus on no other matter than their common resentment of the Igbo.\"",
      "These words capture - in the view of many Igbos - a history of marginalisation that continues to resonate.",
      "For them, this history underscores a deeper purpose - the desire to make their mark and amplify Igbo representation.",
      "Uzoma Ehziem, 34, who moved to the UK almost two decades ago, said he does not feel Igbo culture gets the attention it deserves.",
      "He is one of the club's pacers and believes that Yoruba culture dominates what many in the UK and, globally, think of as \"Nigerian\".",
      "From the legendary Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti to the first African Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, and contemporary stars like Davido, Ayra Starr, and Tems, many of the most prominent figures in Nigerian pop culture are Yoruba.",
      "The exception is literature, where Achebe, and contemporary Igbo authors like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Akwaeke Emezi have gained international fame.",
      "Many in the running club feel the world should know more about the Igbo people.",
      "\"If you tell someone you are Nigerian, the first thing someone will ask is: 'Are you Yoruba?'\" Mr Ehziem said.",
      "The club does not only organise running sessions. It has added monthly social outings for members of the community - from karaoke to dodgeball sessions and even an Igbo gala that will take place next year.",
      "But for now the weekly running clubs have become a source of joy and camaraderie for members.",
      "As the run winds down and all the group meet at the benches again, Mr Odoemene rounds up the runners with the same chant of unity.",
      "Old friends catch up and new friends say hello.",
      "People exchange phone numbers, and as they part ways, the promise to meet again next Saturday is a reminder this isn\u2019t just a fleeting encounter but the beginning of lasting relationships rooted in community and cultural pride.",

      "\"No-one is saying they wanted the death of Samuel Paty, but in lighting 1,000 digital fuses they knew that one of them would lead to jihadist violence against the teacher,\" according to prosecution's submission.",
      "The context in October 2020 was one of heightened tensions over jihadist violence, after Charlie Hebdo republished some of the controversial Muhammad cartoons.   Five years earlier most of the staff of the magazine had been murdered in a jihadist gun attack at their Paris office.",
      "This week in court the longest jail terms were requested for the two friends of Anzorov who accompanied him when he bought a knife and a fake gun. One of them also drove Anzorov to the school on the afternoon of the attack.",
      "Neither of these defendants is a radicalised Muslim, and it was not established in court that they knew of Anzorov's plans.",
      "That was why the prosecution downgraded the charge against them from \"complicity in a terrorist attack\" which carries a possible life sentence.",
      "The four other accused are people with whom Anzorov conversed on chatlines, again without him ever revealing his intention to kill Paty.",
      "One of these, a convert to Islam called Priscilla Mangel, admitted making \"provocative\" remarks online about the Paty case but said she would never have made them had she known Anzorov's intentions.",

      "For defence lawyers, none of the accused would have faced criminal proceedings for what they said, had it not been for the murder of Paty.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:00:24 GMT",
    "summary": "As the longest serving G7 leader, the Canadian prime minister has weathered many storms. But this time might be different.",
    "story": [
      "It was one of the worst weeks of his political career, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ringing in the season.",
      "At the Liberal Party's annual holiday gathering, Trudeau put on his party face, despite being blindsided the day before by the snap resignation of one of his most trusted allies, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, just hours before she was due to deliver an economic statement in Parliament.",
      "But even as some members of his own party were calling on him to leave, the prime minister struck a resolute, defiant tone as he addressed the party faithful in his dark blue suit and tie.",
      "He alluded to his \"difficult\" week, comparing it to a family fight.",
      "He discussed being \"audacious\" and \"ambitious\" in the face of adversity, and made pointed digs at his political rival, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada.",
      "Pundits remarked afterwards that it sounded a lot like a campaign speech, and that despite the latest political turmoil, Trudeau appears to be digging in.",
      "That stance did not change on Friday, even after the leader of the country's progressive New Democrat Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh said he would introduce a motion to topple Trudeau's government in the new year. It was the support of the NDP that had kept the Liberals in power. An election now appears imminent.",
      "Yet Trudeau has so far given no indication that he will resign soon, though he reportedly told fellow party members that he would take time over the winter holiday to think about what to do.",
      "Political observers say Trudeau has often shown a streak of defiance when he is under pressure, something that has helped him weather a number of controversies in his nine years in power.",
      "And he has often been underestimated, such as when he won a majority government in 2015 at the age of 44, despite being portrayed by his political opponents as something of a dilettante.",
      "But as pressure mounts on him to resign, some of those same experts say he may need a new strategy.",
      "Proving his doubters wrong",
      "When Trudeau first ran for prime minister, three words followed him around: Just not ready.",
      "That phrase was the tagline of an attack ad played repeatedly throughout the country as he tried to unseat the incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative who had been in power since 2006.",
      "It conveyed common criticisms he faced at the time about his young age, his relative lack of experience and his winding path to politics.",
      "Trudeau \"sort of meandered around\" in his early life before becoming a drama teacher in Vancouver, said Canadian historian Raymond Blake, seemingly insulated as the well-known and wealthy son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.",
      "But not long after entering politics, Trudeau adopted a fighting stance.",
      "It is a trait that some say he learned from his father, who was known for his charismatic yet combative leadership style, and who is famous for his catchphrase of \"just watch me,\" which he glibly told a reporter at the height of a political crisis.",
      "\"His father had an image of really being a resilient, very tough politician,\" said Lawrence Martin, a long-time Canadian political columnist based in Washington DC.",
      "The younger Trudeau went on to defy the odds himself by pulling off a historic win for his Liberal party, taking them from third-place in parliament to a majority mandate in his first federal election.",
      "\"This kind of makes him feel that he can overcome big obstacles,\" said Mr Martin, adding that, politically, Trudeau operates with \"a hyper amount of self-confidence\".",
      "Trudeau's path to power turned bumpy once he had assumed office, after he became involved in a number of political scandals.",
      "In his first term, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould - the first indigenous woman to hold the job - quit over what she described as attempts at interference and \"veiled threats\" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.",
      "As he vied for a second term in 2019, Trudeau's re-election campaign was rocked by images that were released showing him as a younger man donning brown face on at least three occasions.",
      "And a year later, in 2020, Trudeau faced yet another ethics scandal involving a potentially large government contract for a youth charity that had worked with Trudeau family members.",
      "But in the face of every setback, Trudeau held on to power. He won re-election twice, making him the longest-serving leader of his G7 peers.",
      "\"Trudeau has survived so much,\" Prof Blake said, noting that his political successes and leadership have won the loyalty of many in his party despite the scandals.",
      "Is Freeland's exit a turning point?",
      "While Trudeau has weathered many storms, there are signs that his time may be up.",
      "For one, history is not on his side. Only one Canadian prime minister, Sir John A MacDonald - the country's first - served four consecutive terms.",
      "Trudeau is also working against a sinking popularity. A September poll from Ipsos suggested around two-thirds of Canadians disapprove of him. Just 26% of respondents said Trudeau was their top pick for prime minister, putting him 19 points behind Conservative leader Poilievre.",
      "And then there's the slowly dwindling support within Trudeau's own party. So far, at least 18 Liberal MPs have called for their leader to step down.",
      "\"He's delusional if he thinks we can continue like this,\" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told reporters this week.",
      "\"It's unfair to us MPs, it's unfair to the ministers and most importantly it's unfair to the country. We need to move on with a new direction and we need to reboot.\"",
      "According to Long, who has driven the push to remove Trudeau, as many as 50 of the 153 Liberal MPs want him to quit immediately. Roughly the same number are Trudeau loyalists, he said, and the rest are on the fence.",
      "\"There's still some party loyalists who like him and, you know, want to still support him,\" said Mr Martin, the DC-based columnist. \"But if you had a secret vote of Liberal caucus about whether he should stay on or not, he would be defeated handily.\"",
      "The prime minister is also seemingly driven to stay by his disdain for his political opponent Poilievre, Mr Martin observed.",
      "\"He does not want to back down, and he does want to take on Pierre Poilievre, whom he detests,\" he said.",
      "Trudeau's stubborn perseverance in the face of a dismal political forecast has drawn  comparisons to outgoing US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his candidacy months before the November election only after mounting internal pressure.",
      "Prof Blake said that Trudeau's legacy, like Biden's, will hinge on how he exits. Fighting a losing battle, he said, could give Trudeau \"a lasting scar\". But the prime minister has a remarkable ability to survive, he noted.",
      "\"He's been a survivor, and he hasn't done what's normal. Will normal - whatever it is - fall into place this time? Perhaps, but I'm not convinced.\"",
      "Trudeau's dilemma is also similar to one faced by his father, who won three elections in a row, and went on to win a fourth after leaving power for less than a year.",
      "But by 1984, more than 15 years after first becoming prime minister, the elder Trudeau - like his son now - faced dire polls. It seemed clear he would not win the next election if he stayed on. He decided to step down, telling the public that he made the decision after taking a walk in an Ottawa snowstorm.",
      "Since then, the term \"walk in the snow\" has become synonymous with political resignation in Canada. This Christmas, it remains to be seen whether Trudeau will take his own walk.",

    "summary": "Hideko Hakamata spent decades fighting to save her brother: the world's longest-serving death row inmate.",
    "story": [
      "When a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the world's longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.",
      "\"I told him he was acquitted, and he was silent,\" Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.",
      "\"I couldn't tell whether\u202fhe\u202funderstood or not.\"",
      "Hideko\u202fhad been fighting for her brother's retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.",
      "In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted - ending Japan's longest running legal saga.",
      "Mr Hakamata's case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japan's justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.",
      "Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners' risk of developing a serious mental illness.",
      "And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didn't commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.",
      "Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hideko's close care.",
      "When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in \"his own world\" for years.",
      "\"Maybe it can't be helped,\" she says. \"This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.",
      "\"They made him live like an animal.\"",
      "Life on death row",
      "A former professional boxer,\u202fIwao Hakamata \u202fwas working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the man's wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.",
      "Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (\u00a3199; $556) in cash.",
      "\"We had no idea what was going on,\" Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.",
      "The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.",
      "He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.",
      "Two years after his arrest, Mr\u202fHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.",
      "One prison visit in particular stands out.",
      "\"He told me, 'there was an execution yesterday - it was a person in the next cell',\" she recalls. \"He told me to take care - and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.\"",
      "Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japan's death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.",
      "\"Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution,\" Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.",
      "\"You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you don't know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.\"",
      "James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that \"the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading\". The report concluded that inmates were at risk of \"significant mental health issues\".",
      "Hideko could only watch as her own brother's mental health deteriorated as the years went by.",
      "\"Once he asked me 'Do you know who I am?' I said, 'Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata'. 'No,' he said, 'you must be here to see a different person'. And he just went back [to his cell].\"",
      "Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasn't until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.",
      "A key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.",
      "They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamata's defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his - and alleged that the evidence was planted.",
      "In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.",
      "Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hideko\u202fwho appeared in court, pleading for her brother's life.",
      "Mr Hakamata's fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.",
      "The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered - but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.",
      "That was enough to convince presiding judge\u202fKoshi Kunii, who declared that \"the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place\".",
      "Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.",
      "Hideko's first reaction was to cry.",
      "\"When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears,\" she says. \"I am not a tearful person, but my\u202ftears\u202fjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.\"",
      "Hostage justice",
      "The court's conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.",
      "Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called \"hostage justice\" which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, \"denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning\".",
      "\"These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions,\" Ms Doi noted in 2023.",
      "David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.",
      "He said one reason it dragged on is that \"critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010\".",
      "The failure was \"egregious and inexcusable\", Mr Johnson told the BBC. \"Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.\"",
      "Hideko\u202fsays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.",
      "But Mr Johnson says false accusations don't happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels - from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.",
      "\"Judges have the last word,\" he added. \"When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.\"",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamata's acquittal was a watershed - a rare moment of retrospective justice.",
      "After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised to\u202fHideko\u202ffor how long it took to achieve justice.",
      "A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visited\u202fher\u202fhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.",
      "\"For the past 58 years\u2026 we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden,\" Mr Tsuda said. \"We are truly sorry.\"",
      "Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.",
      "\"We believe that everything that happened was our destiny,\" she said. \"We will not complain about anything now.\"",
      "The pink door",
      "After nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwao\u202falongside family friends and supporters.",
      "Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her \"cute\" little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.",
      "The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.",
      "\"We were always together when we were children,\" she explains. \"I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.\u202f And so, it continues.\"",
      "She walks into Mr Hakamata's room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.",
      "\"He wanted to become a champion,\" she says. \"Then the incident happened.\"",
      "After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.",
      "\"I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.\"",
      "It's the first thing one notices when visiting Hideko's apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.",
      "It's unclear whether it has worked \u2013 Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.",
      "But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.",
      "When asked who she blames for her brother's suffering, she replies: \"no-one\".",
      "\"Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.\"",
      "Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.",
      "Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brother's freedom, says this was their fate.",
      "\"I don't want to think about the past. I don't know how long I'm going to live,\" she says. \"I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\"",

      "Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself.",
      "Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms.",
      "\"I don't see them as evangelical believers,\" he says.",
      "\"I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives.",
      "\"There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer.\"",
      "'Living under siege'",
      "Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade.",
      "As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power.",
      "One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths.",
      "Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living \"under siege\" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion.",
      "\"In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory.\"",
      "Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as \"Jesus is the Lord of this place.\"",
      "Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them.",
      "But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact.",
      "\"These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates.\"",
      "She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela.",
      "'Neo-crusade'",
      "While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has \"increased dramatically\" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall.",
      "Jagun, who is a babalorix\u00e1 (high priest) of the Candombl\u00e9 religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities.",
      "\"This is a form of neo-Crusade,\" he says. \"The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God.\"",
      "But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints.",
      "\"If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] \u00d2g\u00fan, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings.",
      "\"That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'.\"",
      "Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution \u2013 that of religious freedom.",
      "And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule."

    "title": "Five unanswered questions from the Pelicot trial",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 01:49:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Although the Pelicot trial is over, some questions remain over the case that shook France.",
    "story": [
      "French rape survivor Gis\u00e8le Pelicot walked out of a court in southern France for  the last time on Thursday after her ex-husband was  jailed for 20 years for drugging and raping her, and inviting dozens of strangers to also abuse her over nearly a decade.",
      "Dominique Pelicot, 72, was found guilty of all charges by a judge in Avignon. He was on trial with 50 other men, all of whom were found guilty of at least one charge, although their jail terms were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Although the trial is over, there are still questions lingering over the Pelicot case and what happens next.",
      "1. What will Gis\u00e8le Pelicot do now?",
      "When she climbed the steps of the Avignon courthouse for the first time in September, no one knew Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's name. Over the course of the next 15 weeks, her fame as a rape victim who refused to be ashamed of what had been done to her grew vertiginously.",
      "By the time she left the tribunal on Thursday, crowds of hundreds were chanting her name and her picture was on the front pages of newspapers worldwide.",
      "She is now perhaps one of the best-known women in France. This means that although she has stopped using her husband's surname, it will be impossible for her to return to the anonymity that served her so well as she tried to rebuild a life following the revelation of her husband's crimes.",
      "Gis\u00e8le is not the first person whose unimaginable suffering has turned her into an icon. At great personal cost, she has become the symbol of a fight she never chose. It seems unlikely, then, that she will want to become an outspoken activist against gender violence, or a prominent feminist figure. Rather, she may go back to what she has said has always given her solace: music, long walks and chocolate \u2013 as well as her seven grandchildren.",
      "\"At the start of the trial she said: 'If I last two weeks, that will be a lot.' In the end, she made it to three and a half months,\" her lawyer Stephane Babonneau said. \"Now, she is at peace, and relieved it's all over.\"",
      "2. What really happened to Caroline?",
      "Days after Dominique Pelicot's crimes came to light, his daughter Caroline Darian was summoned to the police station and shown photos of an apparently unconscious woman dressed in unfamiliar lingerie. Later, she said her life had \"stopped\" when she realised she was looking at photos of herself.",
      "Her father has always denied touching her, but Caroline \u2013 whose anguish and devastation were apparent in many court sessions \u2013 has said she would never believe him and accused him of looking at her \"with incestuous eyes\".",
      "But the lack of proof of the abuse Caroline is convinced was inflicted on her has led her to say she is \"the forgotten victim\" of the trial. That notion has visibly seeped into her relationship with her mother. In her memoir \u2013 published after her father's arrest \u2013 she accused Gis\u00e8le of not showing her enough support, implicitly choosing to side with her rapist ex-husband over her daughter.",
      "Although Gis\u00e8le and her children have always sat next to one another in court, often whispering huddled together, there have been signs of the toll the trial has taken on their relationship.",
      "On Friday, Caroline's brother David highlighted \u2013 as he has done before \u2013 that the trial had not just been about Gis\u00e8le but about their whole \"annihilated family\".",
      "\"Us children felt forgotten,\" he said. \"Very honestly I feel that while our lawyers did a remarkable job on the defence of our mother, we were a little bit less taken into account.\"",
      "In her memoir, Caroline lamented Gis\u00e8le's \"denial as a coping mechanism\".",
      "\"Because of my father,\" she wrote, \"I am now losing my mother.\"",
      "3. How many defendants will appeal?",
      "Apart from Dominique, all of the jail terms handed down to the defendants were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Several defence lawyers were visibly satisfied, meaning it is unlikely they will encourage their clients to appeal against their sentences. A man called Jean-Pierre Mar\u00e9chal got 12 years \u2013 five less than prosecutors had asked \u2013 and his lawyer Patrick Gontard told the BBC it was \"out of the question\" he would appeal.",
      "The months or years the men spent in pre-trial detention will count towards their total sentences, meaning that some may be freed soon if they have served their minimum term.",
      "One man who was facing 17 years ended up being sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, and his lawyer Roland Marmillot told the BBC that because he had already spent several years in jail it was likely he would be released relatively soon.",
      "Still, by the morning after the trial closed, two men each jailed for eight years had already appealed. More are expected to follow over the next ten days \u2013 the period of time appeals can be lodged for.",
      "4. What else could Dominique Pelicot be guilty of?",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted to assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris in 1999. A cloth imbued with ether was put over her mouth but she managed to fight the attacker off and he fled. It was only in 2021, after he was arrested for the crimes he inflicted on his wife Gis\u00e8le, that Pelicot's DNA was cross-checked with a speck of blood found on Marion's shoe, and he admitted to his guilt.",
      "He has, however, denied any responsibility in another cold case \u2013 the 1991 rape and murder of another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, for which there is no DNA. Investigators have argued that the two cases present too many similarities to be coincidental.",
      "Other cold cases where similar modi operandi were used are also being looked at again.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "5. Will the trial be a turning point?",
      "\"There will be a 'before' and there will be an 'after' the Pelicot trial,\" one Parisian man told the BBC in the early days of the trial.",
      "For many, this sentiment has only grown over the last few months during which the intense media coverage of the Pelicot trial generated countless conversations around rape, consent and gender violence.",
      "\"What we need to do is have much, much harsher sentences,\" Nicolas and Mehdi, two residents of Mazan - the village where the Pelicots lived - told the BBC. They said they were \"disgusted\" when they found out one of the defendants was a man they had played football with.",
      "\"With longer sentences they'll at least they'll think twice before doing stuff like this,\" they said, adding that it was \"crazy unfair\" that some of the men could come out of jail in the next few months.",
      "It is worth noting, however, that the risk of incurring a 20-year prison sentence for aggravated rape did not deter Dominique Pelicot from offering his unconscious wife to be raped by strangers he met online.",
      "There have been calls to reform French legislation on rape to include consent, but that has stalled in the past and would take considerable work in the current divided French parliament.",
      "Some have argued that schools have a responsibility to better teach new generations about sex, love and consent. B\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, has said she believes \"change will not come from the ministry of justice but from the ministry of education\".",
      "Fran\u00e7oise, a resident of the area where Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot used to live, told the BBC she thinks a way must be found to bridge the gap between what children are taught in schools and the type of material they have access to online.",
      "\"Young people are so exposed to sex on the internet and at the same time schools are very prudish,\" she said. \"They should be much more open and frank to match and explain what kids see.\"",
      "What these exchanges show is that, while it will take time before any changes become tangible, a conversation has now started. It will continue until there are no more unanswered questions.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:11:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Army defectors say units sent to fight against Ukraine will have high morale but won't be battle hardened.",
    "story": [
      "What Haneul remembers most about his time in the North Korean military is the gnawing, continuous hunger. He lost 10kg in his first month of service, due to a diet of cracked corn and mouldy cabbage.",
      "Three months into training, he says almost his entire battalion was severely malnourished and needed to be sent to a recovery centre to gain weight.",
      "When they were later deployed as frontline guards to the border with South Korea, rice replaced corn. But by the time it reached their bowls, much had been siphoned off by rear units, and the remainder had been cut with sand.",
      "Haneul says his unit was among the best-fed, a tactic to stop them defecting to South Korea. But it failed to prevent Haneul.",
      "In 2012, he made a death-defying dash across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) \u2013 the strip of land dividing the North from the South.",
      "His experience and that of other military defectors helps shed light on the condition of thousands of North Korean troops deployed to the frontline in Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Pyongyang has reportedly sent around 11,000 troops to help Russian forces reclaim part of its Kursk region taken by Ukraine in a surprise summer offensive.",
      "Earlier this week, Seoul, Washington and Kyiv said the soldiers had now entered the fight \"in significant numbers\", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed.",
      "However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, most belong to the elite Storm Corps unit, and have \"high morale\", but \"lack an understanding of contemporary warfare\".",
      "Only the taller, sportier men are selected for the Storm Corps, says defector Lee Hyun Seung, who trained North Korea's special forces in the early 2000s before defecting in 2014.",
      "He taught them martial arts, how to throw knives and make weapons out of cutlery and other kitchen utensils.",
      "But even though the Storm Corps' training is more advanced than that of regular North Korean units, the soldiers are still underfed and even malnourished.",
      "Online videos, reportedly of the troops in Russia, show younger, \"frail\" soldiers, Haneul says. They are a stark contrast to Pyongyang's propaganda videos, where men are seen bursting out of iron chains and smashing blocks of ice with their bare hands.",
      "During his entire time in the army, Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session.",
      "The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables. Haneul says he ignored instructions to \"shoot any intruders\" and let the man go with a warning.",
      "It is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea. It appears that the country's leader Kim Jong Un has directed much of his limited resources into missiles and nuclear weapons rather than his standing army.",
      "But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are \"incredibly tough\", even for the special forces. The 28-year-old, who worked as a driver in the air force for seven years, says that during his service, conditions deteriorated and rice gradually disappeared from meals.",
      "\"The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.\"",
      "Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk.",
      "Crucially, the Storm Corps are not a frontline unit. \"Their mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and create chaos deep within enemy territory,\" Ryu says.",
      "But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood.",
      "\"Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.\"",
      "The language barrier seems to have created an additional hurdle. On Sunday, Ukraine's defence intelligence unit said communication issues had resulted in North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight.",
      "With these assessments, it could be easy to dismiss the troops as \"cannon fodder\" and a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's desperation. But that would be a mistake, the defectors say. Their loyalty to the regime and fighting spirit will count for a lot.",
      "\"Most of the soldiers in the Storm Corps come from working-class or farming families, who are highly obedient to the party and will follow orders unquestionably,\" says Haneul, whose father and cousin were in the special forces.",
      "Intense, ideological \"brainwashing\" sessions, held every morning, will further ensure they are mentally ready, Lee adds.  He believes the North Korean troops \"will become accustomed to the battlefield, learn how to fight the enemy, and find ways to survive\".",
      "At least 100 North Koreans dead in Ukraine war, says South",
      "What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's war",
      "Although the soldiers will not have been given a choice over whether to be deployed, Ryu thinks many will have wanted to go. The ambitious will see it as an opportunity to advance their careers, he says.",
      "And given how tough it is to serve in North Korea, some will have relished the chance to experience life abroad for the first time.",
      "\"I think they'll be more willing to fight than Russian troops,\" he adds, admitting that in their situation, he too would have wanted to be sent.",
      "Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces, agrees with the defectors' appraisals. \"Just because they lack food and training, does not mean they are incapable. They will acclimatise quickly. We should not underestimate them.\"",
      "While 11,000 troops are unlikely to turn the tide of such an attritional war \u2013 it is estimated Russia is suffering more than a thousand casualties a day \u2013 experts and officials believe this could be just the first tranche, with Pyongyang potentially able to send up to 60,000 or even 100,000 if they are rotated.",
      "In these numbers, Mr Chun believes they could end up being effective.",
      "Also, Kim Jong Un will be able to shoulder big losses without affecting the stability of his regime, the former soldiers say.",
      "\"Those who have been sent will be men without influence or connections \u2013 to put it bluntly, those who can be sacrificed without issue,\" Haneul says.",
      "He remembers being shocked to learn there were no children of high-ranking parents in his frontline unit: \"That's when I realised we were expendable.\"",
      "He does not expect much resistance from the families of the deceased, whose sons, he says, will be honoured as heroes.",
      "\"There are countless parents who have lost a child after sending them to the military,\" he adds, recalling his second cousin who died. His aunt received a certificate, praising her son for his heroic contribution.",
      "The loyalty of the soldiers and their families could blunt Ukrainian and South Korean hopes that many will simply defect once they enter the fight. Kyiv and Seoul have discussed conducting psychological operations along the frontline to encourage the men to surrender.",
      "But it seems they do not have access to mobile phones. According to Ukrainian intelligence, even Russian soldiers' phones are seized before they encounter North Korean troops.",
      "So, possible infiltration strategies include broadcasting messages through loudspeakers or using drones to drop leaflets.",
      "Both Ryu and Haneul decided to defect after reading anti-regime propaganda sent across the border from South Korea. But they are doubtful this would work so far from home.",
      "They say it takes a long time to build up the desire and courage to defect.",
      "Furthermore, Haneul suspects the officers will have been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to flee. He remembers his comrades opening fire as he made his daring sprint across the DMZ.",
      "\"Twelve bullets flew just a metre over my head,\" he says.",
      "Even capturing the North Korean troops may prove challenging for Ukraine.",
      "In the North, being a prisoner of war is considered extremely shameful and worse than death. Instead, soldiers are taught to take their own lives, by shooting themselves or detonating a grenade.",
      "Ryu recalls a famous military song entitled Save the Last Bullet. \"They tell you to save two bullets, one to shoot the enemy and one to shoot yourself.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the former special forces trainer Lee is determined to help. He has offered to go to the frontline to communicate directly with the soldiers.",
      "\"It's unlikely they will defect in large numbers, but we have to try. Hearing familiar voices like mine, and others from North Korea, might impact their psychology,\" he says.",
      "Haneul just hopes they get home to North Korea. He knows there is a chance some of his relatives are among the troops sent to help Russia.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:56:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-husband - who is under investigation for other attacks - has a divided personality, a doctor finds.",
    "story": [
      "It was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his \"\u00e9lan\" - as the French might put it - that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd.",
      "There he stood. A 68-year-old pensioner who had already spent several months inside one of France's most notorious prisons, Les Baumettes in Marseilles. The prison was a grim, intimidating place, crowded with members of the port city's warring drug gangs.",
      "And yet the man in the visiting room who rose to greet Dr Laurent Layet on a cold day in February 2021 seemed \"clean, polished\u2026 He had just cut his own hair. He came towards me with this assertive attitude.\" Dr Layet was surprised, to put it mildly.",
      "The psychiatrist was the first of many people to scrutinise Dominique Pelicot. Each expert was looking for clues to explain how this apparently genial pensioner could have committed such grotesque crimes and deceived his unsuspecting victim for so long.",
      "In all his years interviewing hundreds of rapists and suspected rapists on behalf of French police and prosecutors, Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom.",
      "\"Something didn't fit. I had never encountered such an exceptional case,\" Dr Layet remembers thinking at the time.",
      "At the end of a gruelling, four-month trial that has enraged people across France and far beyond - even as they were inspired by the dignity and courage of Gisele - Dominique Pelicot's confident demeanour, a grandiose presence in the courtroom in Avignon, remained intact.",
      "One might expect a man in Pelicot's position - a globally reviled sexual predator, and rapist, facing the near-certain prospect of dying in prison - to cut a wretched figure. And there have been a handful of brief moments when he wept, openly, in court - usually for himself.",
      "But for the most part, he struck an imperious pose, courtroom microphone in one hand, his body slouched in a throne-like chair (to accommodate the accused's health issues), sometimes looking bored, occasionally interjecting like a ringmaster seeking to keep an unruly circus - the 50 other men on trial beside him - in their place.",
      "\"I am a rapist, like the others in this room. They knew everything,\" he intoned, speaking with the confidence of a man who assumed his words would put an end to all further discussion.",
      "But what are we to make of that domineering performance? And what have we really learned of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife?",
      "Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket. Called in to assess Pelicot, Dr Layet noted how breezily he dismissed his crime, like a genteel grandfather caught pocketing a few cigarettes.",
      "Dr Layet detected a \"dissonance\" in the man's behaviour, and the strong implication that he was hiding something more serious. He told the police that this one was worth closer inspection.",
      "In court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges.",
      "A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness. He could not be dismissed as a \"monster\". Nor was he psychotic - unable to tell reality from fiction.",
      "And yet. There was a \"fissure\", a split, in Pelicot's personality.",
      "A showier witness might have borrowed from popular culture to compare him to a tormented Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or perhaps to Hannibal Lecter, stiff-backed in his prison cell in The Silence of the Lambs.",
      "Instead, Dr Layet reached for a mundane image.",
      "\"Almost like a hard drive,\" he suggested. A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Later, in an interview with the BBC at his office in Carpentras, Dr Layet explained that Pelicot's mind had become divided, over time, like a partitioned computer disk, into two entirely separate \"water-tight parts\u2026 with no leakage between them. His split personality is very effective and very solid. We either have the 'normal Mr Pelicot' or the other Mr Pelicot at night, in the bedroom.\"",
      "Asked in court to explain that \"other\" Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities. They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC:",
      "\"Egocentrisme, fragilite narcissique, perturbations emotionnelles\u2026 une deviance paraphilique melant candaulisme, voyeurism et somnophilie.\"",
      "\"Egomania, narcissistic fragility, emotional disorders... an abnormal sexual deviancy combining candaulism [exposing your female partner to others for sexual enjoyment], voyeurism and somnophilia.\"",
      "Pelicot's own defence lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, enthusiastically embraced the \"split\" personality theory in her closing arguments at the trial. She suggested that the charming young man Gisele Pelicot had fallen in love with and quickly married back in 1973 \"was not the man that had harmed her\".",
      "But that is not what Dr Layet - or the other psychiatrists we have consulted for this article - meant.",
      "There may be two sides to Pelicot's behaviour, but there is - to stick with Dr Layet's computing metaphor - only one operating system that controls his cruel, private urges and his public demeanour.",
      "A simpler way of putting it is that Pelicot has an antisocial personality disorder - a term preferred by psychiatrists these days to words such as psychopath or sociopath. Several experts have concluded it is a reasonable diagnosis to use in the context of Pelicot's warped mind.",
      "He is not \"mad\" - he cannot claim diminished responsibility for his actions. But he does show well-established traits of a personality disorder characterised by a lack of empathy towards other humans. Those traits may have been sharpened by the sexual abuse he experienced as a child.",
      "Which brings us to another key question. Did Pelicot only become a rapist in retirement, or was he preying on women long before he began drugging his wife?",
      "Sitting towards the back of the courtroom one Tuesday afternoon late in the trial, surrounded by journalists tapping away on their laptops, Florence Rault looked at Dominique Pelicot with a particularly well-informed sense of disgust.",
      "\"It can be assumed that what happened in Mazan\u2026 is only the culmination of a long process,\" she said later, in a BBC interview.",
      "Ms Rault, a lawyer specialising in criminal cases, knew something deeply troubling about Pelicot - allegations of appalling crimes arguably more disturbing than those for which he was about to be convicted.",
      "For many years, she had been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.",
      "More than 20 years before the rapes for which he has now been sentenced - in 1999 - Pelicot is accused of assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris. She fought the attacker off.",
      "He eventually admitted to being present at the scene in 2021 after DNA - a spot of blood on the victim's shoe - was finally found to match Pelicot's. But he continues to deny he attempted to rape her and the investigation continues.",
      "\"Once he was told that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said 'Yes, it's me,'\" Ms Rault remembered.",
      "And that discovery quickly led to a link to an even older cold case. In 1991, another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, had been raped and murdered. Although crucial DNA evidence had gone missing, the similarities between the scenes were so striking that Pelicot is under investigation for the crime, which he denies. The search for other potential links to older crimes is also ongoing.",
      "If you've been affected by issues of sexual abuse, information and support is available at BBC Action Line.",
      "Ms Rault is not expecting any more confessions from Pelicot in relation to the cold cases.",
      "\"Until he's confronted with indisputable proof, he will deny [everything],\" said Ms Rault, who once sat beside Pelicot at a hearing and was struck, like Dr Layet, by his \"relaxed, rather serene\" demeanour.",
      "Ms Rault now watched him in the Avignon courtroom and saw the same behaviour. She also noted how Pelicot emphatically and tearfully denied drugging and raping his own daughter, Caroline, despite having taken deeply troubling photos of her, asleep, and without her knowledge.",
      "\"She's convinced that he sexually abused her too. But since we don't have any formal evidence like DNA to put in front of him, of course he will continue to deny it,\" said Rault, arguing that, for Caroline, the agony of uncertainty was as cruel and traumatic as the suffering of a victim who knew exactly what had happened to her.",
      "Pelicot's attitude towards his family in court was often revealing. The psychiatrist, Dr Layet, pointed out that the accused narcissistically focused on the love his wife and children once felt for him, not his betrayal of their trust.",
      "For Pelicot, this \"started out as a love story\" and he \"doesn't want this to be ignored\", said Dr Layet.",
      "But Ms Rault had come to court to look for other signs. Above all, she wanted to shore up her sense that Pelicot's crimes were highly premeditated.",
      "\"Serial rapists\u2026 usually have an impulse. They commit rape. They leave, and then they forget. This is not the case with [Pelicot] at all,\" she said.",
      "Ms Rault recalled the methodical actions of Marion's attacker inside an estate agent's office in 1999. The way he had made an excuse to return to his car - almost certainly to collect a rope and a bottle of ether to drug her. Then Ms Rault noted that the man in the glass cage in Avignon demonstrated a similar self-possession and saw it as further evidence that this was a deeply calculating criminal.",
      "\"When he says he has urges and acts on impulse, it's nothing like that. He is very calm.\"",
      "On the same day that Ms Rault was in the Avignon courtroom, I was sitting nearby. Gisele Pelicot was a few metres to our right. Dozens of the accused sat in front of us. Dominique Pelicot was over to the left side of the room.",
      "During a break in proceedings, I walked over to him. According to French law, journalists are not allowed to talk to the accused. Instead, I stood for a while and watched him as he sat in his chair, behind his glass wall, one hand on his stick. Then his head turned towards me, and he held my gaze for what must have been 20 seconds - although it felt much longer.",
      "His expression did not change. He did not seem to blink. And then, like a bored man switching between equally boring television channels, he looked away."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:12:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC hears how roofs flew off homes as people sheltered inside in the cyclone-hit French territory.",
    "story": [
      "On the night Cyclone Chido hit the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, Zinedine was in his home, a small house made of corrugated iron and wood where he lives with eight of his relatives.",
      "Zinedine had received a warning from the authorities about the cyclone, but he didn't take it too seriously.",
      "\"I thought it was like in previous years when they warned that a cyclone was coming but it would just be a bit of rain. So we stayed home.\"",
      "This time however the island was about to be hit by winds of more than 124mph (200km/h) - the strongest cyclone to hit the island in almost a century",
      "So far 31 people are known to have died, according to French officials, and thousands more feared missing.",
      "When another, more urgent cyclone warning came through, Zinedine swung into action.",
      "\"I told my mum it's never happened before that they send a message like this so I think this time it's serious.\"",
      "He suggested they go to their neighbours' place, a bricks and mortar house not far from his, in a poor neighbourhood high up in the hills of Mayotte's Petite Terre, the smaller of its two islands.",
      "But his mum didn't want to go, and he felt he had to stay home with his family. The 20-year-old tourism student is the eldest boy in his family and feels responsible for them.",
      "When the storm started, he and his mum hid his younger siblings under a table. Then there was a loud noise.",
      "\"The iron roofing of our house flew off. We panicked and looked for shelter. There were iron sheets, wood and other big objects flying everywhere.\"",
      "He took his siblings to the neighbour's hut when he turned around he noticed his mum hadn't followed.",
      "\"I decided to go back outside to get my mother even though it was dangerous with the wind and everything. I'd rather die than leave my mum to die.\"",
      "His mother stood in the middle of their damaged house holding a one-year-old baby. She was terrified and wouldn't let the baby go. Zinedine snatched him from her arms and ran to give him to the neighbours. He eventually had to carry his mother out of the house.",
      "\"Luckily we're all safe but we've lost everything. The only things we were able to save were our papers and diplomas.\"",
      "Now he's trying to rebuild his family's home. Finding new building materials is incredibly difficult in Mayotte at the moment due to high demand, and he couldn't afford new roofing for his house so he tracked down some of the corrugated iron sheets that were blown off by the storm and plans to re-use them.",
      "\"I'm trying to do what I can. Even though I'm not a builder, I want to do it myself because I don't know if the authorities will help us.\"",
      "All across Mayotte, others like Zinedine are attempting to do the same, the sound of hammers ringing late into the night.",
      "But as resourceful as the people of Mayotte are, they're also angry at the lack of support they say they've received from the government.",
      "During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the islands on Thursday, he was booed whilst trying to make a speech. As he visited a hospital, frustrated staff complained of being overwhelmed.",
      "Most of the people we spoke to when in Mayotte were yet to receive any state aid, five days after the cyclone.",
      "\"We've only received food donations from volunteers who've also given us clothes and water. The mayor's office tried to help a bit but that's it\" says 18-year-old mother-of-three Yasmine Moussa.",
      "She took her three boys, the youngest of whom is just three months old, to the closest shelter, a secondary school in the neighbourhood of Labattoir, shortly after receiving the storm warning on Friday afternoon.",
      "\"On the day of the cyclone my children were crying because of the noise. When we  looked outside we saw corrugated iron roofs flying everywhere. They kept asking me what was happening, why everything was breaking,\" she said.",
      "\"I said to them it's just wind and rain but the next day when they saw everything was destroyed. They couldn't sleep that night.\"",
      "When she headed back home, she could hardly recognise her own neighbourhood.",
      "\"Mango trees had fallen during the storm and were blocking the roads. My neighbour had to point my house out to me because I couldn't even spot it. There was water everywhere, the toilet was broken, my TV, everything was ruined. I tried to save what I could.",
      "\"I was in tears, I never imagined this would happen.\"",
      "Now she has nowhere else to go. She says the conditions in the shelter are decent but she needs a house to take her children to. They now sleep on mattresses in one of the school's classrooms with a dozen other families.",
      "\"It's not normal to sleep like this. The doors don't lock and sometimes strangers walk in. I worry for my children's safety and that they will try to steal from us.\"",
      "The Red Cross told the BBC there are at least 100,000 people in shelters around Mayotte.",
      "President Macron has promised compensation for the uninsured, who make up the majority of the population, but he hasn't said how much they'll get.",
      "The needs are huge: almost all of the islands have to be rebuilt. But some on the political right in France argue that spending too much money in Mayotte will only encourage more undocumented migrants to come to the French territory.",

    "story": [
      "As the new Syria struggles to take shape, old threats are re-emerging.",
      "The chaos since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad is \"paving the way\" for the so-called Islamic State (IS) to make a comeback, according to a leading Kurdish commander who helped defeat the jihadist group in Syria in 2019. He says the comeback has already begun.",
      "\"Activity by Daesh [IS] has increased significantly, and the danger of a resurgence had doubled', according to General Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mainly Kurdish militia alliance backed by the US. \"They now have more capabilities and more opportunities.\"",
      "He says that IS militants have seized some arms and ammunition left behind by Syrian regime troops, according to intelligence reports.",
      "And he warns there is \"a real threat\" that the militants will try to break into SDF-run prisons here in north-east Syria, which are holding about 10,000 of their men. The SDF is also holding about 50,000 of their family members in camps.",
      "Our interview with the general was late at night, at a location we can't disclose.",
      "He welcomed the fall of the Assad regime - which detained him four times. But he looked weary and admitted to frustration at the prospect of fighting old battles once again.",
      "\"We fought against them [IS] and paid 12,000 souls,\" he said, referring to the SDF's losses. \"I think at some level we will have to go back to where we were before.\"",
      "The risk of an IS resurgence is heightened, he says, because the SDF is coming under increasing attacks from neighbouring Turkey - and rebel factions it supports - and must divert some fighters to that battle.   He tells us the SDF has had to stop counter terrorism operations against IS, and hundreds of prison guards - from a force of thousands - have returned home to defend their villages.",
      "Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the PKK - banned Kurdish separatists who have waged an insurgency for decades, and are classed as terrorists by the US, and the EU. Turkey has long wanted a 30km \"buffer zone\" in the Kurdish region in northeastern Syria. Since Assad's fall, it is pushing harder to get it.",
      "\"The number one threat is now Turkey because its airstrikes are killing our forces,\" said General Abdi. \"These attacks must stop, because they are distracting us from focusing on the security of the detention centres,\" he said, \"though we will always do our best.\"",
      "Inside Al-Sina, the largest prison for IS detainees, we saw the layers of security and felt the tension among the staff.",
      "The former educational institute in the city of Al-Hasakah holds about 5,000 men - suspected fighters or supporters of IS.",
      "Every cell door is padlocked and secured with three bolts. The corridors are divided into sections by heavy iron gates. The guards are masked, with batons in hand. Getting access here is rare.",
      "We were allowed a glimpse inside two cells but could not speak to the men inside. They were told we were journalists and were given the option of hiding their faces. Few did. Most sat silently on blankets and thin mattresses. Two men paced the floor.",
      "Kurdish security sources say most of the prisoners in Al-Sina were with IS until its last stand and were deeply committed to its ideology.",
      "We were taken to meet a 28-year-old detainee - thin and softly spoken - who did not want to be named. He said he was speaking freely, though on the key issues he wouldn't say much.",
      "He told us he left his native Australia at the age of 19, to visit his grandmother in Cyprus.",
      "\"From there, one thing led to another,\" he said, \"and I ended up in Aleppo.\" He claimed he was working with an NGO in the city of Raqqa when IS took over.",
      "I asked if he had blood on his hands, and was involved with killing anyone? \"No, I wasn't,\" he replied, barely audibly.",
      "And did he support what IS was doing? \"I don't wish to answer that question because it might have an effect on my case,\" he replied.",
      "He hopes to get back to Australia one day, though he's unsure if he will be welcome.",
      "About three hours drive from Al-Sina, behind the wire of Roj camp, many believe that freedom is coming. Somehow.",
      "This bleak expanse of tents - ringed by walls, fences and watch towers - is home to almost 3,000 women and children. They have never been tried or convicted but they are the families of IS fighters and supporters.",
      "There are several British women in the camp. We met three of them, briefly.  All said they had been told by their lawyers not to speak.",
      "In a windswept corner we came across a woman willing to talk - Saida Temirbulatova, 47, a former tax inspector from Dagestan. Her nine-year-old son, Ali, stood quietly by her side. She hopes the overthrow of Assad will mean freedom for them both.",
      "\"The new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa [the head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] made an address, saying he will give everyone their freedom. We also want freedom. We want to leave, most likely for Russia. It's the only country that will take us.\"",
      "The camp manager tells us that others believe IS will come to their rescue and break them out. She asked us not to use her name as she fears for her safety.",
      "\"Since the fall of Assad, the camp is calm. Typically, when it's this quiet, it means the women are organising themselves,\" she said. \"They have packed their bags ready to go. They say: 'We will get out of this camp soon and renew ourselves. We will come back again as IS.'\"",
      "She says there's a visible change, even in the children, who chant slogans and swear at passersby. \"They say: 'We will come back and get you. It [IS] is coming soon.'\"",
      "During our time in the camp many children raised the index finger of their right hands. This gesture is used in Islamic prayer, but also became used by IS militants.",
      "The women in Roj camp aren't the only ones packing their bags.",
      "Some Kurdish civilians in the city of Al-Hasakah are doing the same - fearing a comeback by the jihadis and another ground offensive by Turkey in north-eastern Syria. This would be the fourth invasion by Turkish forces. It's expected soon.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 01:39:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The offensive that ended Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule has left the country facing an uncertain future",
    "story": [
      "Last week, while touring Damascus, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) was approached by a young woman who asked for a photo with him. He gently requested that she cover her hair before taking the picture.",
      "The incident quickly sparked heated debate across Arabic social and mainstream media.",
      "What happened may have been small but it was telling because it encapsulated the tightrope that Syria's new rulers Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK - must walk.",
      "On one side is the diverse, and, in some cases more liberal, Syrian population, along with the international community, whose acceptance is crucial for HTS's survival and legitimacy. To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women.",
      "On the other side, Islamist hardliners criticised al-Sharaa for taking the photo at all, describing the woman as a \"mutabarijah\" - a term for a woman perceived to dress immodestly or wear makeup - and insisting his action violated religious rules.",
      "These hardliners hold significant sway over militant factions and could rally opposition within al-Sharaa's own Islamist base.",
      "HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.",
      "The group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions.",
      "In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia.",
      "His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.",
      "Significant unease",
      "It is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda.",
      "But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.",
      "Even if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision.",
      "However this is not a new challenge for HTS.",
      "From IS to al-Qaeda to HTS",
      "For a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving.",
      "HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction.",
      "It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions.",
      "This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.",
      "While its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom.",
      "Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman.",
      "However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.",
      "How rebels won hearts and minds",
      "HTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies.",
      "The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.",
      "The civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa.",
      "The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches.",
      "But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth.",
      "Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.",
      "The group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers.",
      "During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia.",
      "However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.",
      "Hardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions",
      "Although some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo.",
      "Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib.",
      "Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".",
      "Despite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future.",
      "For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024.",
      "These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces.",
      "And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.",
      "Other rebel rivalries",
      "Until recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology.",
      "For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad.",
      "The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.",
      "HTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders.",
      "Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership.",
      "IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces.",
      "With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.",
      "To consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority.",
      "Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria.",
      "In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.",
      "'Power grab'",
      "When asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\"",
      "This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form.",
      "But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.",

      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "HTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge.",
      "Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone.",
      "Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny.",
      "Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.",
      "Some viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria.",
      "Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives.",
      "Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key.",
      "A week ago the young woman wanting a photo was asked to cover her hair.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:07:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Leaked intelligence from military spies is helping turn the civil war in the resistance\u2019s favour, BBC finds.",
    "story": [
      "The once formidable Myanmar military is cracking from within - riddled with spies secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels, the BBC has found.",
      "The military only has full control of less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a BBC World Service investigation reveals.",
      "The junta still controls the major cities and remains \"extremely dangerous\" according to the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar. But it has lost significant territory over the past 12 months - see map below.",
      "The soldier spies are known as \"Watermelons\" - green on the outside, rebel red within. Outwardly loyal to the military but secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels whose symbolic colour is red.",
      "A major based in central Myanmar says it was the military's brutality that prompted him to switch sides.",
      "\"I saw the bodies of tortured civilians. I shed tears,\" says Kyaw [not his real name]. \"How can they be so cruel against our own people? We are meant to protect civilians, but now we're killing people. It's no longer an army, it's a force that terrorises.\"",
      "More than 20,000 people have been detained and thousands killed, the UN says, since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021 - triggering an uprising.",
      "Kyaw initially thought about defecting from the army, but decided with his wife that becoming a spy was \"the best way to serve the revolution\".",
      "When he judges it safe to do so, he leaks internal military information to the People's Defense Forces [PDF] - a network of civilian militia groups. The rebels use the intelligence to mount ambushes on the military or to avoid attacks. Kyaw also sends them some of his wage, so they can buy weapons.",
      "Spies like him are helping the resistance achieve what was once unthinkable.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November this year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "The investigation reveals that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass. Much of the remaining area is contested.",
      "The military now controls less than at any time since they first took control of the country in 1962, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled).",
      "Co-ordinated operations between ethnic armies and civilian militia groups have put the military on the back foot.",
      "After heavy territorial losses earlier this year Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing made a rare admission that his forces were under pressure.",
      "The leaked Watermelon intelligence from within the military is helping to tip the balance. Two years ago, the resistance set up a specialised unit to manage the growing network of spies and to recruit more.",
      "Agents like Win Aung [not his real name] collect the Watermelon leaks, verify them where possible, and then pass them on to the rebel leaders in the relevant area.",
      "He is a former intelligence officer who defected to the resistance after the coup. He says they are now getting new Watermelons every week and social media is a key recruitment tool.",
      "Their spies, he says, range from low-ranking soldiers to high-ranking officers. They also claim to have Watermelons in the military government - \"from the ministries down to village heads\".",
      "They are put through a strict verification process to ensure they are not double agents.",
      "Motivations for becoming a spy vary. While in Kyaw's case it was anger, for a man we are calling \"Moe\" - a corporal in the navy - it was simply a desire to survive for his young family.",
      "His wife, pregnant at the time, pushed him to do so, convinced the military was losing and he would die in battle.",
      "He began leaking information to the Watermelon unit about weapons and troop movements.",
      "This kind of intelligence is crucial, says pro-democracy rebel leader Daeva.",
      "The ultimate goal of his resistance unit is to take control of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city and his former home. But they are a long way off.",
      "The military retains the majority of major urban areas - home to crucial infrastructure and revenue.",
      "\"It's easier said than done to attack and occupy [Yangon], Daeva says. \"The enemy will not give up on [it] easily.\"",
      "Unable to physically penetrate the city, Daeva from his jungle base directs targeted attacks by underground cells in Yangon using Watermelon intelligence.",
      "In August, we witnessed him making one such call. We were not given the details but were told it was to direct an assassination attempt on a colonel.",
      "\"We will do it inside the enemy's security parameters,\" he told them. \"Be careful, the enemy is losing in every direction,\" he added, telling them that this meant they were more likely to be on alert for infiltrators and spies.",
      "Daeva says several major attacks by his unit have been the result of tip-offs.",
      "\"We started with nothing and now look at our success,\" says Daeva.",
      "But it comes at a cost. Watermelons have to live in fear of both sides, as navy corporal-turned spy Moe discovered.",
      "Deployed from Yangon to Rakhine - a border region where the military is fighting an ethnic group siding with the resistance - he had to live with the terror that his intelligence could mean he himself was attacked.",
      "In March this year, his anchored ship was hit with a projectile missile, followed by open fire. \"There was no place to run. We were like rats in a cage.\" Seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in the rebel attack.",
      "\"Our ability to protect [the moles] is very limited,\" admits Win Aung. \"We can't publicly announce that they are Watermelons. And we can't stop our forces from attacking any particular military convoy.\"",
      "He says that when this is explained to the Watermelons, however, they do not falter. Some have even responded: \"When it comes to that moment, don't hesitate, shoot.\"",
      "Outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "But there are times when the spies can no longer bear the danger.",
      "When Moe was set to be sent to another dangerous front line, he asked the Watermelon unit to smuggle him out into a resistance-controlled area. They do this using an underground network of monasteries and safe houses.",
      "He left in the dead of night. The next morning, when he did not show up for duty, soldiers came round to the house. They interrogated his wife Cho, but she remained tight-lipped.",
      "After days on the run Moe arrived at one of Daeva's bases. Daeva thanked him over video call, before asking him what role he wanted to play now. Moe replied that, given his young family, he would like a non-combat role and would instead share his knowledge of military training.",
      "A few weeks later he crossed into Thailand. Cho and the children fled their home too and hope to eventually join him and build a new life there.",
      "The military is aggressively trying to reclaim lost territory, carrying out a wave of deadly bombings. With Chinese- and Russian-made fighter jets, it is in the air that it has the upper hand. It knows that the resistance is far from being one homogenous group and is seeking to exploit divisions between them.",
      "\"As the junta loses control, their brutality increases. It's getting worse. The loss of life\u2026 the brutality, the torture as they lose ground, literally and figuratively,\" says UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews.",
      "The military is also conducting sweeps for Watermelons.",
      "\"When I heard about the sweeps, I stopped for a while,\" says Kyaw. He says he always acts like a staunch supporter of the military to avoid unwanted attention.",
      "But he is scared and doesn't know how long he can stay hidden. Defecting is not an option, as he worries about abandoning his ageing parents, so for now, he will keep acting as a military spy, hoping to see a day when the revolution is over.",
      "If and when that day comes, Watermelons like Kyaw and Moe will not be forgotten, Win Aung vows.",
      "\"We will treat them with honor, and allow them to choose what they want to do next in their lives.\"",
      "The military did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "About the data:",
      "Researchers commissioned by the BBC questioned multiple sources from 12 February to 13 November 2024 for each of more than 14,000 village groups to assess the level of military control in their area.",
      "The names and boundaries of village groups were sourced from the Myanmar Information Management Unit, or MIMU, which is hosted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).",
      "In every case, the research team spoke to at least one source with no official affiliation to the military or the opposition - such as academics, charity workers, journalists and local residents.",
      "When sources provided conflicting information for a village group, unaffiliated sources were prioritised and further cross-referenced with media reporting.",
      "Responses were divided into three possible categories of control:",
      "Military: The military is present and active in the region. It operates a local administration or provides certain public services, which are all functioning normally.Contested: The military is present in the region, but there are limits to its effective control. This could include areas where general administration and public services are not fully operational, or where the military divides administration with regional ethnic armed forces.

Civil services may be provided by resistance forces, ethnic armies or a civilian government, likely supported by a rebel armed militia.",

    "title": "Rare accounts of life for women inside notorious Iranian prison",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 02:25:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Interrogations, beatings, cramped quarters and the tight bonds women forge inside Tehran's Evin prison.",
    "story": [
      "Crouched alone on the floor, in a tiny, windowless cell, Nasim could hear what sounded like other prisoners being tortured. The guard would bang on the door and say: \"Can you hear that beating? Get ready, you're next.\"",
      "She was \"interrogated for 10 to 12 hours every day\" and repeatedly threatened with execution.",
      "The bare cell, no more than two metres across, had no bed or toilet. Four months in solitary confinement was the 36-year-old hairdresser's introduction to Iran's notorious Evin prison. The only people she saw were her interrogators. She thought that she would \"die and no-one would know\".",
      "We have pieced together accounts from multiple reliable sources to build a picture of everyday life for Nasim and other women, who are currently being held in Evin prison.",
      "Many were among the tens of thousands of people arrested in connection with the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Mahsa had been arrested for allegedly breaking Iranian laws that require women to wear the hijab and she died in police custody.",
      "While people have spoken about conditions in Evin after they have been released, it is rare to get details of inmates' lives while they are still inside.",
      "What we have heard reveals not only brutality, but a place of complex contrasts where the prisoners continue to campaign for women's rights and defiantly challenge restrictions imposed on them. There are surprising moments too - one inmate, occasionally allowed time alone with her husband, has even got pregnant.",
      "Nasim - who loves rap music and make-up - was taken into custody in April 2023 after joining protests with her friends, one of whom was killed in the government crackdown. She survived interrogations \"by thinking about those who died on the street\". People who saw Nasim when she came out of solitary confinement have described cuts and bruises on her body and how she was tortured to make false confessions.",
      "Rezvaneh was also arrested following the protests, along with her husband, in 2023. They both ended up in Evin, which has separate sections for men and women. Her interrogators said they would kill her husband and \"hit him so much that he would turn black like coal, and purple like an aubergine\".",
      "After solitary confinement, interrogations and humiliation, Nasim was moved to the women's wing, that houses about 70 people, including Rezvaneh, most of whom were arrested on political charges.",
      "It is where the British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcilffe, who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022, spent nearly four years of her sentence.",
      "Most of the women there have been sentenced because of their activism, for offences including spreading propaganda, drawing arms against the regime, and endangering national security.",
      "They live in four crowded cells with up to 20 people in each one and bunk beds stacked three-high.",
      "Living together in cramped quarters often causes friction, and sometimes fights - both physical and verbal - break out. But the women also forge tight bonds.",
      "In winter, \"everyone is freezing\" and the women \"walk around with hot water bottles\" to stay warm. In summer, they swelter in the heat.",
      "There is a small kitchen area with a couple of hobs where - if they have enough money to buy food from the prison shop - they can cook for themselves to supplement the basic prison meals that are brought to their cells.",
      "A dark, dirty area at the end of a corridor serves as a place to smoke. A small cemented yard with a little area for plants and a volleyball net provides a bit of outside space.",
      "They can wear their own clothes and are free to move around their living quarters which have two bathrooms. Every evening, they queue to use the toilet and brush their teeth.",
      "It was here, after she had been in prison for about four months, that Rezvaneh found out she was pregnant.",
      "She had struggled with infertility for years and had given up on ever having a baby. But according to Evin's rules, she and her husband - who is still a prisoner in the men's wing - were occasionally allowed to meet in private and, on one of these occasions, she conceived.",
      "When she realised she was pregnant she \"cried for several days\".",
      "She found \"the worst thing was the mental pressure and tensions inside the prison\". Finding a quiet place in the crowded cells, where people spend most of their days sitting on their beds, was a constant challenge.",
      "The prison food left her craving apple juice, bread, and meat, which were hard to get hold of. When she could get some meat from the prison shop it was at least twice the price of meat on the outside.",
      "The prison eventually allowed her to have an ultrasound scan at four months, and doctors told her she was having a girl.",
      "As she listened to \"each heartbeat the sense of hope became stronger\". But she was afraid that the conditions in prison would endanger the baby's health. Rezvaneh was not just concerned about her diet - she has epilepsy and needed to avoid stress. Prison doctors told her she had a high risk of miscarriage.",
      "Vida, a journalist, loves to paint. She uses bedsheets for canvases and paints portraits of the other women.",
      "One, which was smuggled out of Evin, is of Kurdish prisoner Pakhshan Azizi who travelled to Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria to help victims of the Islamic State group. Pakhshan has been sentenced to death, following charges of using arms to fight the Iranian regime, and there is great concern this sentence could be carried out soon.",
      "Vida has been warned not to draw anything with a hidden meaning. On one of the walls in the yard she painted crumbling bricks with a green forest behind them. The authorities sprayed over it.",
      "In a corridor she painted a picture of an Iranian cheetah running. Some of the women \"kept saying how much good energy they got from it\". But one night the authorities \"went and painted over it\" and restricted Vida's access to painting supplies.",
      "One of her murals has been left intact though - huge, blue ocean waves on the walls of the corridor where the women go to smoke.",
      "Getting medical care has been a constant battle for the women. One of the inmates, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, has life-threatening heart and lung conditions.",
      "But in prison she has had to fight long and hard for access to a doctor. Relatives said that officials repeatedly blocked treatment because she refused to wear a headscarf to a medical appointment. The authorities only relented after fellow prisoners went on hunger strike for two weeks. Narges was released for 21 days at the start of December on medical grounds.",
      "Behind bars, she and the others have carried out protests, pushing the boundaries and continuing to fight for their rights. Although the law requires them to wear headscarves, many refuse. And after a long fight with the authorities, the women were allowed curtains around the beds so they could have some privacy, out of view of CCTV cameras.",
      "One of the toughest things for the women is waiting to hear their sentences. Nasim's interrogators had threatened her with the death penalty and she had to wait nearly 500 days to find out her fate.",
      "She found solace in her fellow prisoners - who she has described as sisters who give her life and act as \"a balm on the wounds\" of her wings.",
      "Every morning, one of her friends pulls aside the bed curtain and makes her get up for breakfast.",
      "\"Each day we think of something to do, so by the end of the day we can tell ourselves, 'We lived today,'\" one of our sources explains.",
      "Others spend their time reading poetry, singing, playing homemade card games and watching TV - there are two televisions where they can watch Iranian channels showing drama, documentaries and football.",
      "It is these small things that kept Nasim going while she waited for her sentence, under the constant threat of execution. When the sentence finally came, she was given six years in prison, 74 lashes and 20 years in exile in a small town far from Tehran. She had been charged with distributing propaganda and drawing arms against the Islamic Republic.",
      "Despite the severity of the sentence, Nasim felt she could breathe again, and embrace the life she thought she had lost.",
      "Three other women in the wing have been sentenced to death for drawing arms against the regime or affiliation to armed groups. However one of them has had her sentence overturned.",
      "More than 800 people were executed in Iran last year - the highest number in eight years, according to Amnesty International. Most were for crimes involving violence and drugs. A handful were women.",
      "So every Tuesday, the women protest against executions, chanting in the prison yard, refusing to move all night and staging hunger strikes. The campaign has spread through jails across Iran, gaining international support. On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death the women in Evin burned headscarves.",
      "There have been repercussions - sometimes the guards raid their cells and women have been beaten and injured. They can also be taken for further interrogations, put back in solitary confinement or have phone calls and visits blocked. Most of the guards are women and \"sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are cruel and hard-hearted, depending on what orders they receive from a higher authority\", says one of our sources.",
      "The Iranian government routinely denies allegations of human rights violations, saying conditions inside Evin prison meet all necessary standards and prisoners are not mistreated.",
      "As Rezvaneh's due date approached, the prison authorities allowed her to temporarily leave prison for the birth. In October, she had a baby girl.",
      "But her joy and relief at the safe arrival of her daughter is mingled with fear, sadness and anger. Her husband was not allowed out of prison with her, although she has been able to take their daughter to visit him in Evin.",
      "And because of the stress, Rezvaneh has struggled to produce breastmilk. She is expecting to be recalled to Evin prison soon with her baby daughter to serve the rest of her five-year sentence - if she's not granted an early release, that could be nearly four years.",
      "Babies are usually allowed to stay with their mothers in jail until the age of two. After that they are often sent to a close relative, or if that is not possible, they might be placed in a children's home.",
      "But rather than stop the inmates, one prisoner has said the challenges they face have made her  \"braver and stronger,\" supporting their belief that \"the future is clear: to fight, even in prison\".",

    "title": "Werner Herzog keeps working, predicts: \"You'll have to carry me out from a set feet first\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

    "title": "Darren Criss on counting his lucky stars",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:29:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Darren Criss became a fan favorite on the hit TV series \"Glee,\" and won an Emmy for \"American Crime Story.\" Now he's starring in the acclaimed musical \"Maybe Happy Ending.\" He talks about his road to Broadway, and his credo that \"Life is a cabaret.\"",
    "story": [
      "Thirty-seven-year-old Darren Criss is a star on Broadway, and a regular at piano bars. \"Keep the music going, you know?\" he said. \"I think the expression goes, 'Life is a cabaret!'\"",
      "When he's in Los Angeles, it's Tramp Stamp Granny's, where he and his wife, Mia, are the owners. \"It's kind of a beautiful little Hollywood tale,\" he said. \"She slings the drinks, and I sling the tunes.\"",
      "One rule in a piano bar? Play the hits.  Criss had his first hit at the University of Michigan. He starred as Harry Potter in an unauthorized student show based on the books that became a YouTube sensation in 2009.",
      "\"This was a very interesting moment in time,\" he said, of \"A Very Potter Musical.\" \"That really did kind of change my life. That would kind of set me on the path to where I am now.\"",
      "From 2009: The unofficial parody show \"A Very Potter Musical\":",
      "I asked if \"A Very Potter Musical\" was the first musical to go viral. \"I don't know; I guess we'll let the YouTube historians sort of decide the validity of that,\" Criss said.",
      "But Criss took a detour on his way to Broadway, by becoming a TV star. \"'Glee' was happening at the time,\" he said. \"And I went out for it, like hundreds of thousands of other people in my situation at that time. And I happened to book it.\"",
      "He played Blaine Anderson, and quickly became a fan favorite. \"I owe my tenure on that show to the sub-cultural fan base army that we had gathered from the Potter stuff,\" he said.",
      "Watch Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) perform Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\" on \"Glee\":",
      "Criss went on to win an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of serial killer Andrew Cunanan in \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.\"",
      "Now he plays an obsolete robot named Oliver in a new musical, \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" one of the most acclaimed shows currently on Broadway. The New York Times calls it \"joyful,\" \"heartbreaking,\" and \"supersmart.\"",
      "Criss said, \"This show begins with a song which is the question the show posits: Why love? Why do we do it? If we know that loving something enters you in a contract that has an inexorable back end \u2013 which is the loss of something \u2013 why do we do that, if we know that that's gonna happen?\"",
      "According to Criss, this show came along at the perfect time. He and his wife, Mia, have a two-and-a-half year-old daughter, and earlier this year they welcomed a baby son.",
      "I asked, \"Does this feel like the best year of your life?\"",
      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",
      "He's had some hard years, too. In 2020, his father, Bill, died at 78 from a heart condition. In 2022, his brother, Chuck, died at 36 by suicide.",
      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it.

    "summary": "The iconic singer-songwriter has long been a silver screen presence \u2013 as an actor, a subject of documentaries, and the figure in biopics. But Bob Dylan's love of movies has been a recurring theme in his art and his persona.",
    "story": [
      "A new Bob Dylan biopic, \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, arrives in theaters Christmas Day. As historian Douglas Brinkley tells us, it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy love affair between Dylan and the movies.",
      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",
      "-- \"I Shall Be Free\" by Bob Dylan",
      "Young Bob sported a leather jacket after seeing Marlon Brando in \"The Wild One.\" When he saw the juvenile melodrama \"Blackboard Jungle,\" with its innovative rock 'n' roll soundtrack, he reportedly said to a friend, \"This is exactly what we've been trying to tell people about ourselves.\"",
      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",
      "Once Dylan made it to New York's Greenwich Village, it was the art-house international films that caught his eye: Truffaut's \"Shoot the Piano Player\" \u2026 Fellini's \"La dolce vita.\" That film, about a tabloid journalist searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic Rome, looked, Dylan later said, \"like life in a carnival mirror.\"",
      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",
      "His music has enhanced scores of movie scores, from \"The Big Lebowski,\" to more recently \"St. Vincent.\"",
      "One film stuck with Dylan for decades: \"The Gunfighter,\" starring Gregory Peck. When Peck heard his name in Dylan's epic 1986 ballad \"Brownsville Girl,\" he phoned him up to thank him. Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997, when he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "The new biopic \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring an astounding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is hardly the first cinematic depiction of Dylan. But it's a reminder of the enduring and symbiotic relationship between Dylan and the movies \u2026 and a welcome excuse to revisit the work of this singular American artist.",

    "title": "The story of Handel's \"Messiah\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

      "Actress Blake Lively is suing her \"It Ends with Us\" co-star Justin Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "For months, rumors swirled of an onset of discord between the two actors that appears to have culminated with a lawsuit by Lively in which she alleges Baldoni \u2013 who was also the film's director \u2013 caused her \"severe emotional distress.\"",
      "The complaint, which was obtained by CBS News, names Baldoni, the studio behind \"It Ends With Us\" and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the complaint, which was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "The complaint also says Baldoni \"abruptly pivoted away from\" the movie's marketing plan and \"used domestic violence 'survivor content' to protect his public image.\"",
      "\"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\" attorney Bryan Freedman told the AP in a statement. Freedman represents Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.",
      "Freedman pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio \"proactively\" hired a crisis manager \"due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\" He said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film \"if her demands were not met.\" Those demands were not specified in the statement.",
      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" while promoting the film, Baldoni said he hoped the movie would help to create a safer world through compassion and empathy. He said he wanted men to go see the romance movie and take accountability in their lives after watching it.",
      "\"I want men to go to the theater and in some ways see a version of themselves. You have two very different characters. Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Iconic rock band the Grateful Dead was named a Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating decades of their innovation and success.",
      "\"It's a legacy thing for me and us, I think,\" drummer Mickey Hart said of the honor.",
      "The surviving members \u2014 Bobby Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Hart \u2014 told \"CBS Mornings\" the honor is not just for the band members, but for their fans.",
      "\"They kept us goin,'\" Weir said.",
      "Grateful Dead forms",
      "The band formed in the San Francisco Bay area in the mid 1960s. Weir was 16 when he first heard Jerry Garcia playing banjo outside a music shop in Palo Alto.",
      "\"It was New Year's Eve, basically he invited us in. We had enough fun that evening that we decided it was too much fun to walk away from,\" Weir said.",
      "Kreutzmann recalled seeing Garcia and Weir play at a club.",
      "\"I was totally blown away by Jerry's ability to hold the audience in his hands. Jerry held the light for everybody,\" he said. \"That week he called me and said, 'Hey, you wanna be in a band?' I said, 'Sure.'\"",
      "Kreutzmann later brought Hart into the band in 1967.",
      "\"Bill invited me to play and sit in. When I heard the band, I go, 'Whoa.' We all got turned on to the Grateful Dead in different ways, but we really got turned on to it,\" Hart said. \"We got bit.\"",
      "Garcia also recruited Phil Lesh, a classically trained musician, to play bass. Lesh, one of the band's original members, died in October at 84 years old.",
      "Grateful Dead's legacy",
      "In their 30 years as a band, the Grateful Dead scored just one Top 40 hit with \"Touch of Grey,\" and not a single Grammy nomination.",
      "\"We've had people come up to us, say, 'You guys are never gonna make it. You play too long. You play too loud,'\" Kreutzmann recalled.",
      "But through their decades together, they built a legion of followers known as \"Deadheads,\" who started recording and sharing their concerts.",
      "\"You'd look from the stage and it looked like a forest of trees of microphones,\" Kreutzmann said of their fans recording their concerts.",
      "Their record company advised against allowing fans to record, but the band refused, saying they weren't worried about piracy.",
      "\"It was the smartest thing we ever did,\" Kreutzmann said.",
      "The Grateful Dead played more than 2,300 concerts and fans recorded most of them.",
      "\"Those cassettes went out all over the world,\" Hart said. \"They were our archivists as well.\"",
      "When Garcia died in 1995, the band broke up after 30 years together. They weren't sure they could find a way to carry on without their frontman.",
      "\"When Jerry left that was the end of the Grateful Dead. Period. There's just no way that you can replace a Jerry Garcia,\" Kreutzmann said.",
      "The surviving members went off to start other projects and bands, but the Grateful Dead's spirit would always live on. Weir said Garcia visits him in dreams from time to time, including recently.",
      "\"In the dream, Jerry comes to me and he says, 'Listen, I'm gonna invite a song in to meet you. I want you to meet this song.' \u2026 What that dream did was, it solidified in me the notion that, yes when we play the songs, they're living things,\" Weir said. \"They come and visit our world and they come through us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet back in 2020 in Los Angeles.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\"Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\" the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "An email from The Associated Press seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez's behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing. It also comes after Pete\u00a0filed a lawsuit in October against blogger Milagro Gramz, accusing Gramz of purposely spreading false information on behalf of Lanez.",
      "That lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida against Gramz, a popular content creator who is legally known as Milagro Elizabeth Cooper. The lawsuit accuses Cooper of intentionally causing Pete emotional distress by cyberstalking, promoting and sharing deepfake pornography of Pete and questioning if she was actually shot.",
      "Tuesday's petition says a protective order issued to prevent previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system. Lanez is being held at a California prison in rural Tehachapi.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",

      "During the interview, Glaser also reflected on advice from those who have hosted major award shows before.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",

      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",

Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",
      "The Congolese government had sent a rapid intervention team to the Kwango province, 435 miles southeast of capital city Kinshasa, consisting of epidemiologists and other medical experts. Their objective was to identify the disease and mount a suitable response. Government officials had earlier warned locals to avoid touching people infected with the illness or the bodies of those who had died.",
      "Congo has suffered from many disease outbreaks in recent years, including typhoid, malaria and anemia. The country has also grappled with an\u00a0mpox outbreak, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease, according to the WHO.",
      "Anti-malaria medicine provided by the WHO was being distributed at local health centers in Congo, and WHO officials said more medical supplies were due to arrive in the country Wednesday.",
      "It's the rainy season in Congo, which often sees a rise in malaria cases, and will certainly complicate treating those most at risk.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

      "Nearly 3 million Americans will receive full Social Security benefits under legislation passed in the waning hours of the current Congress and now headed to President Biden, who is expected to sign into law.",
      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",

      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came shortly after midnight, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down.

You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill.. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",

      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers.

    "title": "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits, but policies still cause hardship",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:25:50 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" said an 84-year-old woman whose late husband's Social Security benefits were slashed. \"It's not fair.\"",
    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits will be cut nearly in half \u2014 reduced by $557, to $601.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",
      "Later, she became a public school teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, paying into CalSTRS, California's educator pension fund. However, her plans for retirement took an unexpected turn when she discovered the intricacies of the pension system.",
      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",
      "But these policies brought a different kind of heartache for Dede Ruel, a retired school psychologist in Illinois.",
      "She said she recently received a letter from Social Security informing her that she owed more than $13,000, reducing her Social Security checks by 21%.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",
      "\"I have been trying to appeal it through their process and I've been denied at every level,\" Ruel said.",
      "The Social Security Administration's press office provided comments after the initial publication of this story, stating that \"state and local government employers are\u00a0required\u00a0to disclose potential effects of WEP/GPO on newly hired non-covered employees.\"",
      "\"We work to pay the right people the right amounts at the right time, and Social Security issues correct payments in most cases,\" a Social Security spokesperson said. \"However, there is room to improve, as people count on the agency to prevent overpayments and underpayments from happening.\"",
      "Bipartisan support for the Social Security Fairness Act",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, one of the most bipartisan bills in Congress this session, aims to repeal WEP and GPO.",
      "The House\u00a0voted\u00a0to pass the legislation Nov. 12, and the Senate approved it on Friday, Dec. 20.",
      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",
      "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" Paternostro said. \"It's not fair.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the amount of Michelle Cosgrove's benefits.",

    "title": "How a U.S. government shutdown could have impacted benefits and services",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. government faced the threat of a shutdown if Congress didn't pass a spending bill before Dec. 21, 2024. Here's a look at the potential impact.",
    "story": [
      "Update, 12:45 a.m. Saturday:\u00a0The U.S. government avoided a prolonged government shutdown after the House and Senate approved a short-term\u00a0funding bill,\u00a0sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "As the fight over a federal spending bill went down to the wire, the U.S. faced a looming deadline for a government shutdown that could have began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. That raised questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted if funding lapsed just days before the holidays.",
      "The threat of a shutdown stemmed from controversy over a spending bill to extended funding through March 14, but which fell apart after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill. A revised version also failed on Thursday before another attempt on Friday finally passed.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Could a shutdown hurt the U.S. economy?",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers, among other impacts, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "\"A government shutdown could leave a visible mark on the economy,\" he wrote. \"Apart from the direct macroeconomic consequences of a shutdown, financial markets and private sector confidence could also be affected.\"",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

    "summary": "The strikes were scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle, and could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
    "story": [
      "Workers at Starbucks stores began a five-day strike Friday to protest lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "The strikes by baristas and other workers were scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle and could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve. Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks' baristas, said at least 10 locations were closed down as of midday Friday.",
      "In Los Angeles, striking Starbucks barista Cassie Pritchard told CBS News Friday that workers are looking for \"fair wages that are livable\u2026You should be able to afford rent, food and healthcare.\"",
      "Pritchard said Starbucks' offer of a 1.5% yearly raise won't even keep up with inflation.",
      "\"It's a pay cut in reality,\" Pritchard said. \"It's a nominal pay raise, but it's only in name.\"",
      "The walkouts came a day after the Teamsters union announced strikes at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Starbucks said early Friday there was \"no significant impact\" to its store operations.",
      "\"We are aware of disruption at a small handful of stores, but the overwhelming majority of our U.S. stores remain open and serving customers as normal,\" the Seattle-based coffee giant said in a statement.",
      "Workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize, but Starbucks has nearly 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores",
      "Starbucks Workers United, which began the unionization effort in 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The union noted that Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But it said the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years.",
      "\"Our CEO is the face of corporate greed in America right now,\" Pritchard told CBS News.",
      "\"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners,\" Starbucks Workers United President Lynne Fox said.",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week.",
      "\"We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations are currently focused on pay raises. Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of at least 1.5% for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",
      "Starbucks said the union wants to increase the minimum wage for hourly workers by 64% immediately and 77% over the life of a three-year contract.",
      "Starbucks said it already pays an average of $18 per hour. With benefits \u2014 including health care, free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 Starbucks' pay package is worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "The strikes won't be the first for Starbucks during the busy holiday season. In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",
      "The union and the company struck a different tone early this year, when they returned to the bargaining table and pledged to reach an agreement. Starbucks said it has held nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and has reached more than 30 agreements with the union.",
      "But Starbucks has struggled with falling sales and lower customer traffic in the U.S. and abroad this year, and the CEO who promised to work for a labor agreement, Laxman Narasimhan, was forced out this summer. Niccol quashed a unionization campaign at Chipotle when he was the CEO there, but he pledged to work constructively with the union in a September letter.",
      "Now, Starbucks and the union appear to be at an impasse.",
      "\"In a year when Starbucks invested so many millions in top executive talent, it has failed to present the baristas who make its company run with a viable economic proposal,\" Fatemeh Alhadjaboodi, a Starbucks barista from Texas and bargaining delegate, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S., as the House appeared to have averted a government shutdown late Friday.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",

      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",
      "Air traffic controllers are also deemed essential employees and would be expected to work while foregoing a paycheck. Employees would be paid after a shutdown were to end.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group representing the industry, on Friday said a government shutdown could cost the sector $1 billion per week given that disruptions would occur during a peak travel period.",
      "\"A prolonged government shutdown threatens holiday travel disruptions that Americans won't tolerate,\" Geoff Freeman, the group's CEO, said in a statement. \"It's hard to see how anyone in Congress wins if they force TSA workers, air traffic controllers and other essential employees to work without pay during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.\"",
      "A survey by the group also found that 60% of Americans said they would consider changing their travel plans if a government shutdown occurs, including canceling flights and trips altogether, resulting in significant economic losses for travel-related businesses.",
      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",
      "In the event of a shutdown, the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the U.S. would be expected to show up to work without pay.",
      "What would a government shutdown mean for passport processing?",
      "According to the State Department's contingency plan, consular operations will continue as normal \"so long as there are sufficient fees to support operation,\" given that they are integral to national security. That includes passport and visa services.",
      "Still, some passport services could be limited, if they are located in buildings run by another agency that is inoperational.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 17:20:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what's driving up home heating costs, and how much families are expected to spend this winter.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to spend more money heating their homes this winter than on holiday gifts, according to new research.",
      "The elevated cost of staying warm indoors amid cold outdoor temperatures comes after an unusually hot summer, that led to households spending bigger shares of their budgets on cooling costs, compared with previous years, according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

      "The IRS\u00a0said\u00a0Friday it is sending a total of $2.4 billion in \"special payments\" to 1 million people, part of an effort to ensure that Americans who didn't receive all of their federal stimulus checks during the pandemic will get the money in their bank accounts.",
      "The payments will vary by person, with a maximum amount of $1,400 per recipient, the agency said in a statement.",
      "\"To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we're making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,\" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.",
      "Who will get a payment from the IRS?",
      "The tax agency said it's disbursing the funds after reviewing internal data that showed many people had filed tax returns but yet didn't claim what is known as the \"recovery rebate credit\" in 2021.",
      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",
      "Most taxpayers who were eligible for the stimulus payments have already received them directly, or later through the recovery rebate credit.",
      "Do you need to apply for the IRS payment?",
      "No. The IRS said it's sending the payments automatically to about 1 million people who filed tax returns and who qualified for the recovery rebate credit yet didn't claim it. The agency will send a letter to recipients to let them know they will receive the payment.",
      "When will the IRS send the payments?",
      "The tax agency said the checks will be sent in December, with most of the payments arriving by late January 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Three Major banks and Zelle rushed to bring a peer-to-peer payment network to market without first ensuring users would be protected against \"widespread\" fraud, alleges a lawsuit filed on Friday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",
      "JPMorgan also accused the agency of pursuing a \"political agenda,\" stating that the agency was \"overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase said it prevents nearly $20 billion in fraud attempts each year, and that 99.95% of its transactions are completed without dispute.",
      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",
      "\"These troubling alleged practices need to be addressed by all parties as quickly as possible,\" Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's crucial that in our increasingly cashless age, we have digital financial systems that the public can trust and use without fear of losing their money.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

      "Senators on Wednesday voted 73-27 to approve a motion to move forward with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, and then on Thursday voted 73-23 to proceed to the bill, with both tallies clearing the 60-vote fillibuster threshold. Only a simple majority is needed for final passage in the Senate in order to pass the bill to President Biden's desk.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure on Wednesday. Vance and fellow Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Joe Manchin, an independent and outgoing senator from West Virginia, did not participate in Thursday's vote.",
      "The Senate was scheduled to reconvene on Friday, and is expected to resume consideration of the measure after votes related to confirming two judges to serve in California.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Wednesday. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",

      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",

      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said last week, the Associated Press reported.",

      "Although 2024 is winding down, the U.S. housing crisis\u00a0lives on. But even as steep home prices and elevated mortgage rates sideline many would-be homebuyers, some real estate markets around the country continue to attract them.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) this month released a list of 10 local housing markets it expects to be hot spots in 2025, outperforming the rest of the country in sales. The locations have been chosen by NAR based on their current individual strengths across 10 key economic, demographic and housing factors that are considered predictors of future market activity.",
      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Mr. Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Mr. Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Mr. Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through the PSLF.",
      "\"From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\"",
      "Still, he has fallen short of his goal to deliver widespread relief to millions of other Americans. Mr. Biden's first attempt at mass cancellation was blocked by the Supreme Court, and his second attempt remains tangled in a legal battle brought by Republican states.",
      "In October, he proposed another rule that would cancel loans for people facing various kinds of financial hardship, though it's unlikely to take effect.",
      "President-elect Trump hasn't detailed student loan plans for his second term, but on the campaign trail he called Mr. Biden's cancellation plans illegal and \"vile.\" Republicans in Congress have slammed Mr. Biden over his cancellation work, saying it unfairly transfers the burden to taxpayers who didn't go to college or already repaid their loans.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",

      "Americans are being urged not to buy or use liquid-burning portable firepits sold for tabletops and other uses following the deaths of two people and dozens of injuries.",
      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",
      "Little opted to share what happened to her while noticing the popularity of the firepits while shopping for the holidays.",
      "\"When I search Yankee swap gifts under $30, it's pretty much the No. 1 gift that comes up right now,\" Little said. \"A lot of different companies are making them.\"",
      "The CPSC recently warned against FLIKRFIRE Tabletop Fireplaces and announced the recall of Colsen-branded firepits after a series of alarming incidents left 19 people with burn injuries, with some requiring surgery and others permanently disfigured.",
      "Fire pits that require pouring isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or other liquid fuel into an open container or bowl and then ignite the pooled liquid in the same location in which it was poured violate voluntary safety requirements.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters says workers at seven Amazon facilities went on strike Thursday morning in an effort by the union to pressure the e-commerce giant for a labor agreement during a key shopping period. People have begun picketing in some locations, including one in the New York City borough of Queens.",
      "The Teamsters say the workers, who authorized walkouts in the past few days, are hitting the pavement after Amazon ignored a Dec. 15 deadline the union set for contract negotiations. Amazon says it doesn't expect any impact on its operations during what the union calls the largest strike against the company in U.S. history.",

      "Why are Amazon workers striking?",
      "\"Amazon is pushing its workers closer to the picket line by failing to show them the respect they have earned,\" Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien said in a statement.",

In the process, the company has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement.",
      "\"The truth is that the Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated, and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal and is the subject of multiple pending unfair labor practice charges against the union,\" Nantel added.",
      "The Teamsters have argued Amazon essentially controls everything the drivers do and should be classified as an employer.",
      "Some U.S. labor regulators have sided with the union in filings made before the NLRB. In September, Amazon boosted pay for the drivers amid the growing pressure.",

      "The Fed said Wednesday it's cutting its benchmark interest rate for a third time this year, continuing the sharp turnaround begun in September when it started lowering rates  from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves lower interest rates, but the Dec. 18 cut had been widely expected by Wall Street.",
      "Why is the stock market down today?",
      "Investors were unsettled by the Fed's forecast for fewer cuts in 2025, even though many economists had already been paring their expectations given sticky inflation.",
      "\"Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves,\" Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an analyst note. \"The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected\u2014this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year.\"",
      "The bigger question centers on how much more the Fed could cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024.",
      "Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point's worth. That's down from the four cuts they had expected just three months ago.",
      "\"We are in a new phase of the process,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. The central bank has already quickly eased its main interest rate by a full percentage point, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, since September.",
      "What happened to the stock market today?",
      "Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their pace of cuts, Powell pointed to how the job market looks to be performing well overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. He also cited uncertainties that will require policy makers to react to upcoming, to-be-determined changes in the economy.",
      "While lower rates can goose the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and boosting prices for investments, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",
      "Powell said some Fed officials, but not all, are also already trying to incorporate uncertainties inherent in a new administration coming into the White House. Worries are rising on Wall Street that President-elect Donald Trump's  preference for tariffs and other policies could further juice inflation, along with economic growth.",
      "\"When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,\" Powell said. It's \"not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.\"",
      "One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, thought the central bank should not have even cut rates this time around. She was the lone vote against Wednesday's rate cut.",
      "Wall Street's worst performers",
      "The reduced expectations for 2025 rate cuts sent Treasury yields rising in the bond market, squeezing the stock market.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%.",
      "On Wall Street, stocks of companies that can feel the most pressure from higher interest rates fell to some of the worst losses.",
      "Stocks of smaller companies did particularly poorly, for example. Many need to borrow to fuel their growth, meaning they can feel more pain when having to pay higher interest rates for loans. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, General Mills dropped 3.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year.",
      "Nvidia, the superstar stock  responsible for a chunk of Wall Street's rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows.",
      "\"As we wrote in our 2025 outlook a couple of weeks ago, stretched positioning and sentiment left stocks vulnerable to a sell-off,\" Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial said in a note about today's market sell-off. \"The big jump in inflation expectations and related bond sell-off was a convenient excuse.

      "Speaking in a Wednesday press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that progress in driving inflation down to the central bank's goal of a 2% annual rate has been slower than expected, with consumer prices in November rising\u00a02.7% on a yearly basis, fueled by elevated housing and food costs.",
      "\"I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call\" to cut rates, Powell said about Wednesday's rate cut. \"The slower pace of cuts for next year reflects the higher inflation readings we've had this year.\"",
      "The Fed might opt to skip a rate cut in January, while resuming easing at its March meeting, said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.",
      "\"While the Fed opted to round out the year with a third consecutive cut, its New Year's resolution appears to be for a more gradual pace of easing,\" Watson said.",
      "New monetary policy phase",
      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Given that inflation has been sticky this year, many analysts have predicted that the Fed was likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Powell's bullish economic outlook",
      "While Powell said that the slow progress in grinding down inflation has been \"a bit frustrating,\" he also sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy, stressing that the nation's growth has far outpaced that of other developed economies.",
      "\"It's pretty clear we've avoided a recession \u2014 growth this year has been solid,\" Powell said. \"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable,\" while other countries have contended with slow growth and \"struggles with inflation.\"",
      "He added, \"I expect another good year next year.\"",
      "As far as Trump's stated plans to enact broad-based tariffs, which many economists forecast could prove inflationary, if enacted, Powell said the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is examining the potential impact from tariffs, but it will be \"quite some time\" until there are policies put into place by the second Trump administration for the central bank to examine, Powell added.",

      "The Justice Department is investigating whether the routers' relatively low price violates a law stipulating that companies can't sell goods for less than the cost of production, the WSJ reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. On Amazon.com, a handful of router models by T-Link are available for sale with a base model costing around $99. The routers are available for sale through a business unit in California as well.",

Found in everyday devices like laptops, tablets and even electric toothbrushes, these batteries can catch fire if they overheat or are damaged.",
      "Last July, panic erupted on an American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Miami after a laptop battery in a carry-on bag ignited.",
      "\"It was absolute chaos. It truly felt like every man for themselves. And it was terrifying,\" said Shilpa Patel, a passenger on the flight. \"I don't know if we're going to explode. All I know is I need to get out and I need to survive.\"",

      "\"Any fire at 30,000 feet is unacceptable,\" said David Wroth of UL Standards & Engagement, a safety research organization.",
      "A survey of more than 800 flight attendants conducted by UL found that 87% are concerned about lithium battery risks on airplanes, and more than a third believe airlines should do more to ensure passenger safety. While the FAA requires airlines to include general safety information in preflight announcements, those warnings often don't address the specific risk of\u00a0battery fires.",
      "\"It's a balance we probably need to do a better job striking with the airlines,\" said Ben Supko, who oversees hazardous materials safety for the FAA. \"Passengers don't fully understand how serious the risk is.\"",
      "Supko said passengers need to monitor devices during a flight and immediately notify the crew if a device becomes warm, discolors, or bulges. Passengers are also warned not to pack lithium batteries\u00a0in checked luggage, as fires in the cargo hold are harder to extinguish.",
      "\"When you don't know what's going to happen, you act erratically,\" said Patel. \"It costs us nothing just to say, 'Hey, the reason why we're so serious about this is because it could be really dangerous. It could catch fire.'\"",
      "The UL survey also found that one in four passengers admits to packing lithium batteries in their checked bags. It is a dangerous practice for one reason in particular: It would be even harder to put out a fire in the plane's cargo hold.",

      "Continuing a decades-long effort to change the nation's bankruptcy system, Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to propose legislation on Wednesday aimed at making the process less costly and complicated for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who seek court-sanctioned relief from debt each year.",
      "\"People typically file for bankruptcy for one of three reasons: a job loss, a medical problem or a family breakup \u2014 and when they do, they're faced with an expensive and complicated system,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement in reintroducing the bill, known as the \"Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act.\"",
      "\"My bill would simplify and modernize the consumer bankruptcy system to make it easier and less expensive for people to get relief,\" Warren added.",
      "Bankruptcies rising",
      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate. The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the AFL-CIO, a labor union, and consumer advocacy groups Public Citizen and National Consumer Law Center.",
      "\"Big corporate debtors continue to reap the rewards of our broken bankruptcy system while everyday Rhode Islanders facing financial hardship struggle to obtain basic relief. I'm pleased to support this bill that makes the consumer bankruptcy system fairer and easier to access for those facing crushing personal debt,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.",

      "No-payment discharge. For low-income filers, this option would wipe out unsecured debt other than child support or debts incurred by fraud.Debt-specific plans.\u00a0This would let individuals resolve debts specific to their financial situation, pausing debt collection efforts\u00a0 paused while filer remains current on loans.",

      "The change would be a welcome one, according to advocates, who say the current bankruptcy rules can steer people in the wrong direction.",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where the filer's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in three to six months.",
      "With a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, payments can be spread out, but the overall costs for filers is significantly higher, running an average of $4,500. Only about a third of people who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged, research shows.",

      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",
      "Following the legislation's failure, the Biden administration instituted asylum restrictions that dramatically cut off the flow of immigration. When asked about the timing amid criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration possessed the authority without Congress to act on the border, Mayorkas acknowledged that the administration may have taken the action more quickly if they knew the border deal would be torpedoed.",
      "\"Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly,\" Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments come as border crossings have dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration, after reaching record highs a year ago.",
      "The Homeland Security Secretary noted that before Mr. Biden came into office, the \"trend lines of migration\" were increasing exponentially in 2018 and 2019 worldwide, \"and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\" He added over time, the Biden administration built up capabilities that have allowed it to transport individuals and decompress areas seeing surges in immigration, saying that \"we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration.\"",
      "\"We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four, and we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case,\" Mayorkas said.",

He understands the process,\u00a0 but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has\" with the House and Senate, which will be in Republican hands in January.

      "That's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job. We have ran that play before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We're \u2013 in my eyes, you use Christmas. You use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, let's get it done now.",
      "There's also a bigger danger to this, too, is, if we're not funding the government long term\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: \u2026 now all of a sudden, you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well.",
      "So, basically, it was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the C.R.",
      "But I want to ask you about the dynamic here because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the speaker of the House. What role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president. We have a vice president. We have a speaker. And it feels like - - as if Elon Musk is our prime minister.",
      "And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unelected.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Well, unelected.",
      "But, I mean, he has a voice. And I think a lot of \u2013 large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these \u2013 a 1,500-page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order.",
      "The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over this spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: They were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united. And it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal.",
      "Do you support him if \u2013 he's standing for reelection. Should he still lead the party, if you're saying he was leading in the wrong direction with a 15-page (sic) initial funding deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. And I do. I do support Speaker Johnson. I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats on the House, right?",
      "So that's a tough job to begin with. But the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with \u2013 with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members to find a solution just goes to prove that he's found a way.",
      "But there also \u2013 this can't be the norm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the C.R. is, this cannot be the norm. We have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills.",
      "Homeland security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But, right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention.",
      "Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July. And there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81-year-old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public.",
      "Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I wasn't aware.",
      "I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining in age, like a lot of members do. And, sadly, some of these members wait until it's too long \u2013 too \u2013 too \u2013 things have gone too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think it's maybe \u2013 I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it.",
      "I'd say, on the other side of the aisle, it's the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think this goes \u2013 gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there. And, apparently, it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows.",
      "I need to get to the border, because that is \u2013 you have, what, 800 miles of the border in your district.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Border Patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low.",
      "Does that mean, coming into office, that essentially the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Oh, no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has started to do some things right, the Trump administration is going to do everything right, in this manner.",
      "And I will tell you why. This is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat \u2013 the worldwide threats to homeland \u2013 to our homeland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I will share some of the open-source stuff in Syria. A lot of us are rooting for a free Syria.",
      "A free Syria brings a lot of opportunities for first ability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy. He imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going?",
      "Well, let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to get his thoughts on the homeland security challenges facing the new next administration.",
      "Here's part of our conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We recently saw that killing of the UnitedHealthcare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): The rhetoric on social media following that \u2013 that murder is extraordinarily alarming.",
      "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country. And, unfortunately, we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I \u2013 look, we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's against CEOs? That's against the government? That's against leadership?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances.",
      "And the language of violence accompanying or being a part of those narratives is something that we're very concerned about that. That is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the health care industry and what that company was doing. It's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And \u2013 and the victim is a person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers.",
      "And I don't think \u2013 I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents.",
      "Why is it so hard to reunite families? And how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force. But there's more work to be done.",
      "Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma.",
      "So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is unclear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 because the \u2013 we were not left with good records. Data was not kept. And so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.",
      "The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, we certainly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.",
      "That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: What we do is, we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.",
      "Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking. But there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian. And they move, and, sometimes, the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.",
      "I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration.",
      "How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is, critically, one element of it. It is not the only element of it.",
      "The president took executive action in June of this year. That has been a key driver of the \u2013 the low number of encounters at our border. We are now delivering\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the U.S. since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, it is \u2013 Margaret, it is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War II.",
      "This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you have said to me one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then, fast forward, you had this bipartisan near- miss on a border bill. All that time passed.",
      "Why wait until five months before the U.S. election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow, that ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, remember where \u2013 Margaret, remember where we were when the president took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The prior administration had imposed Title 42, which is a public health authority\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42, which we did. That held until May of 2023.",
      "We then turned to Congress, and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding.",
      "Denied. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics.",
      "Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020, if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "Because Republicans argue in this back-and-forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis starting at day one, when Trump era immigration policy was peeled back, remain in Mexico, the 100-day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction.",
      "Did those measures \u2013 and I know you weren't yet in office personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Remember something. Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea.",
      "The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019. And that is reflected worldwide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Remember something also about the executive action that the president took in May \u2013 in \u2013 in June of this year. We also over time built capabilities that we did not previously have, not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world.",
      "We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10-year high under President Biden, a 10-year high. So what shifted at DHS that \u2013 that prompted this deportation of more than, what, 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year?",
      "That \u2013 that's one of the highest numbers in recent years\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Congress didn't give you the power, how did you do it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we did it with skill, with strategy, and with unflinching dedication to that mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would also suggest that there is the ability to do it without Congress acting, right? That's the downside of showing you can make it work.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes, but, Margaret, we made those very impressive statistics happen.",
      "But there is much more work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And what we have to do is to ensure that the problem does not continue.",
      "This broken system needs to be fixed. And it's not just to ensure that individuals who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States are removed, but it's also to ensure that we are providing humanitarian relief\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to those who qualify, one of our proudest traditions, and that we are also fueling the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that this massive Chinese hacking known as Salt Typhoon, the hacking of eight telecom companies that siphoned up this metadata, the phone call records, logs and information for millions, potentially, of Americans, was accessed.",
      "Why hasn't the U.S. government stopped it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: The intrusion is a very significant one and an extraordinarily impactful one and an absolutely unacceptable one.",
      "And the president has demonstrated a strong response to the People's Republic of China. It is very sophisticated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I'm sorry,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically, when he met with Xi Jinping?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, just recently, the United States Department of Commerce proposed a \u2013 an action against China Telecom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So this is an ongoing situation. It is not static.",
      "The intrusion is a very sophisticated one. The telecommunications companies are working very vigorously to remediate it. They are working in partnership with us, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the largest intelligence compromise, potentially, in U.S. history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is a very serious compromise, and requires very serious action to remediate and recover from it, and also very serious response to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "How did you find it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is not something I can \u2013 I can speak to.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL (R-AR): Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you.",
      "This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did.",
      "Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines? I mean won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the president's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page because with narrow majorities we've got to work together. And that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Mark Short, who was the director of legislative affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025.",
      "What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and, again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, wanted to use the budget reconciliation process. That's still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of The Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business having access to capital.",
      "So, I think we're on the same page. And I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that last year when we - last year, in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security for an all of the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on. We are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor, as well, as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on U.S. investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies.",
      "Your Democrat colleague, Rosa DeLauro, insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation were - was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the - America's - America's national security. But striking that balance has been difficult. But I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people - a majority of members clearly wanted a simple, straightforward, continuing resolution and not what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR.",
      "So, I think president - I mean Speaker Johnson did a good job coming back around from that, focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with Majority Leader Thune on how we would tackle reconciliation to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. That's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing chair of House Financial Services, was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have a strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica De La Cru of Texas. And we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan, our conference chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from south Florida, joining our committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: They will be active leaders in Financial Services policymaking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, I know you've been trying to restrict Captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, first, we need the United States to be very active, work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime as it relates to all the people murdered, killed, imprisoned, tortured, in the - from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing Captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that. But it needs to be stopped.",
      "But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict Captagon and cut off the funding because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime. And that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that.",
      "Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well, a source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former Congressman Matt Gaetz's alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. Last month, on this program, you said it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "Do you still object?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And it's not - well, I don't know, but that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are - they have released documents before. But I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution because you open up a pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years, conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Congressman French Hill, thank you and have a Merry Christmas.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Late last week we spoke with retiring West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, known for playing a pivotal, sometimes frustrating, role with Democrats in many of their legislative achievements. The full interview is on our YouTube channel and website. For the broadcast, we looked to next year when Republicans are fully in charge of Washington.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when you were speaking to us on FACE THE NATION last January, you said, \"I love my country too much to vote for Donald Trump. I think it would be very detrimental to my country.\"",
      "He's the president-elect. Do you think he is detrimental to America?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (I-WV): January 6th was a bridge too far for me. And I think everyone knows that. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him and we always got along great. We're very friendly. Had - just - we just had disagreements on some things. But you can do that.",
      "When the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray with everything you have that the president will be successful.",
      "This is about our country. And I want him to succeed. And I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've talked about the need to return to bipartisanship and regular order.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Donald Trump is promising to destroy regular order, upend the system.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I - I have -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I have - I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that won't (ph) let that happen. They have the chance (ph). They have the power. And I think there's enough Republican senators, and Democrat senators too. That are not going to let the filibuster blow apart, they're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to. It takes four Republican senators, just four. And I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That will protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around. And in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's the power of the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans, \"a once in a generation investment in border security,\" but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So, with 51 votes, not the 60, you - you're saying right now that this is - this is not how the system's supposed to work.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Hold on, Margaret. If - he's going to have to show the financial connotation and the cost it's causing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then step two is tax reform. That's the plant.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Yes. Well, here, I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically, when you've given up, that you can't work with the other side, they come out of the box that way. So, this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting. That was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. We wrote that bill in my committee. And I guarantee you, I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I feel - no, I feel horrible about that we had to do it in reconciliation. I feel horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. We didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3 percent. We brought down gas prices from $5 to $3. We did all of that. But the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic. The prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort, made it almost unbearable for people to - for the burden they were carrying.",
      "The IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president-elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. When you pass a piece of legislation, and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it.",
      "If the White House says, I want this type of interpretation, that makes it very, very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. I said, you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way. In spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals, we're still depending on China when we were supposed to be weaning ourself off of China. He can fix that immediately.",
      "President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He - and change - change the bill. It will be his - it will be his energy bill. But, you know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Reprograming, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there, tax credits for nuclear biofuels. Do you think parts - you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I think it almost has to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: The investments are made. And most of the investments - the majority of the investments are made in what you would consider red states. Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: They couldn't talk about it. He was tongue tied.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, can't you just exact - tell what the bill did. They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. The only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything with renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running.",
      "Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So, I said, we're going to produce what we need, and we do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So, the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil, you wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill, then he can change it, change the name, it will be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. OK? My Democrat friends are so far off the rail. OK, I love them all, but they're - I said, guys. But a lot of them really understand it. They just can't speak it because the base has gone so far. And that's - I just - I couldn't take it anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, she is a Republican, but she's also known for being pretty independent.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: She's the best of the best, my - my dear friend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She said, \"the next four years are going to be hard. The Trump administration's approach is going to be, everybody toe the line, everybody line up. We got you here. And if you want to survive, you better be good or we will primary you.\"",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Thank God for rank choice voting. Without - without rank choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the Democrat and Republican Party control the primaries, they can control you up here. So, they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry, you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So, I'm going to find somebody else that I can control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who else is going to stand up to the president-elect when they disagree and be willing to say so out loud? Are there other senators up here who will do it?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I would hope - you know, you - my father used to tell me, if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're OK. If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I never did say, oh, you're wrong. You don't go - you can't start out a conversation that's going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end.",

Carstens sought help finding American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago.",

I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean you would almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have, like, 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing and yet in a way fascinating.",
      "But really the bottom line is that we have to help and - or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search has been exhausted.",

We conducted a joint search of a facility that we thought - we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So, I understand, of course, their past. What I can tell you right - is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",

But really the long - the - I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. With the time that we had on the ground, it seemed to be our best shot. So, we gave it a good, hard look. We're going to review all the information and evidence that we collected, and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability. But really our job is to just to keep searching.",

Again, in the joint search that we conducted with the interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's going to have to be brought back. It's going to have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints. They may have traces of DNA.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens is the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and he joins us now from Amman, Jordan. This was a high risk visit to Damascus, the first since the Assad regime fell. Why was it important to be face to face and go there?",
      "ROGER CARSTENS, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: Margaret, thanks for having me on today. You know, I think it was important because we've been in the area since about the 9th of December, shortly after Damascus fell and the Assad regime left. We flew out to Beirut, later, we restaged to Amman, and our job's been really to cast a wide net to work with partners, allies, NGOs, and even members of the media to try to cast this wide net to search for places that we believe Austin Tice may have been held over the last 12 years. But there's something about getting face to face with the people that have been searching and certainly something about getting face to face with the interim authorities to determine what's seen, to what extent has it- have these sites been cleared, and to maybe find bits of information that you're just not going to get over a phone or over email.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told reporters that you were amazed at the number of secret prisons that Bashar al-Assad had, more than 40 of them. Have those prisons been searched yet, and do you know if journalist Austin Tice was held in them?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I think obviously a lot of them have been, not only by members of the general public, but also by members of this conglomerate of people that are on the hunt and search for not only Austin Tice, but people like Majd Kamalmaz, and other Americans that have gone missing. So if another, I would say, underground prison compound's discovered even tomorrow or three days from now or three weeks from now, at this point, I'm not gonna be shocked. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating.

Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So Margaret, I'm- I'm not one of the policy people that render some of these decisions, that's done by people that spend years perfecting this. They're- most of them are lawyers, and I wasn't smart enough to get a law degree. But what I can tell you is that they've treated us well in terms of our search. I've been talking to them for, I wanna say almost, probably nine or 10 days, and they've been helpful in conducting the search. They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we- we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So I understand, of course their- their past. What I can tell you right- is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: You know, Margaret, we had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities. And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites and of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long- the- I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. You know, you can get information from Syria, which to an extent has been a black box in terms of gathering information on Austin, and with all the things, all the, I guess I'd say reports being overlaid, it becomes clear that some places have a higher probability than others. And this, with the time that we had in the ground, seemed to be our best shot. So we- we gave it a good, hard look. We're gonna review all the information and evidence that we collected and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability, but really, our- our job is to just keep searching. You know, it- sometimes it takes a while to determine whether the information is valid or not. And when we g- go to the hard work of crosschecking it, but out of all the sites that we could have looked at, out of the 40 or so prisons that we've identified, and out of the six priority prisons, we went to the one that we felt had the highest chance of giving us some sort of evidence that Austin had been there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prison- prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist? Have you gone through them to look for evidence of Austin and the Virginia doctor you mentioned, Majd Kamalmaz?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So we've had a chance to find various documents, or I would even say file folders, holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's gonna have to be brought back. It's gonna have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints, they may have traces of DNA. So we're still in the, I would say the research phase, but the bottom line is we did find some documents. We're taking a hard look at them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with, but I will tell you this. I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. My office SPEHA is involved because of the diplomatic angle and aspect. So today on the ground, we were working with members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people that are experts at looking at crime scenes, and they did a wonderful job of sweeping it, using all their skills, talents, and capabilities to bear, to- to find the right documents that might make sense to gather the evidence that they felt might give us a- more certainty. But that's- I'll probably just leave it at that. We were with members of the- the law enforcement community, the FBI, and I think they- they were the ones that were able to give us this good look that we otherwise would not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Debra Tice, Austin's mother, sent a letter that became public to the Israeli prime minister, asking him to have his military stop bombing prisons, because she believed her son might be in one of them. Has that bombing complicated the search?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say, to the extent that- of knowledge that I have, no. Now I may not have full- a full picture. You talked earlier about the dis- or the difference between being in Beirut and talking to people on the phones and sending texts, WhatsApp, Signal messages, or being in Amman and doing the same. When you get on the ground and get face to face, you're able to suck in or vacuum in a lot more information. From the information that I've received, the bombing has not really impeded any of the search efforts for Austin. However, I would not want to be too firm about that because there are bits of information that I may not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This wasn't your first trip to Damascus. I know back in 2020, you went there at the direction of then president Donald Trump- Trump, along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then, and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Well, what I can tell you is that the regime, when we talked to them in- in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They- they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL, as we call it. They essentially asked for a lot and said, if we're- the United States were able to deliver everything, they might be willing to have a discussion about this- this person that we're asking about, or to discuss our interests. At that time, they wouldn't even mention his name. So they were not- they were asking for a lot and giving pretty much nothing, and it made for the conversations very frustrating. I would say that at some point we came across information and that's- as highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, that led us to believe that at one point, the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they- did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through. But at one point we- we feel very confident that the regime did detain and have Austin Tice in their custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And before I let you go, the family of Dr. Majd Kamalmaz was told by U.S. intelligence that their father likely died when he was in captivity. Is there a reason for them to continue to hope? Did you discover anything about him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say that if I were in their shoes, I would always want to press to- until I get something that's very conclusive. And my role is- being a part of the U.S. government, my job is to pursue- pursue as rigorously as I can, the truth. And my- I would probably tell the family, and I actually have, I- I've met the family numerous times, I've been in their homes, I've had a chance to- to break bread with them. And I always tell them, no matter what the status is of Majd, we're bringing him home one day. I think if I was in the family's shoes, I'd always have a hope that he was alive. I think the U.S. government's been firm, at least on the information that they've been able to provide about his status. But regardless, we're gonna keep pursuing Majd's case. And one day, at some point, I think we're gonna be able to put that to rest and bring him home.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Sen. Joe Manchin, independent of West Virginia, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Manchin, thank you for making time for us.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Margaret, it's always good to be with you. You know that, and I enjoy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're always plain spoken, and there's a lot to get to with you. I have to start on this moment of time we are in. There's such uncertainty here on Capitol Hill about whether Congress can come to this new agreement just to keep the lights on and the government funded. After Jan- after- Excuse me, let me start again. There's concern that the government may not come to an agreement to keep the lights on after December 20. This is after Elon Musk and President Elect Trump came out against a bipartisan deal at this 11th hour. Do you think the government's going to shut down?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I don't. I don't think anybody- I think anyone's been here from 2013 remembers- goes back, when it was shut down, all the harm it's done to so many good people, not their fault at all. Innocent people in America, getting harmed because of dysfunction here in Washington. I think what you'll see, Margaret, is, if they're having a hard time getting their legs under them right now, President Trump is out there, but also he wants to hit the ground running. So he's looking, don't put me behind- behind the eight ball, if you will. So they're watching everything very closely. Unfortunately, what you're going to see is a bunch of CRs, probably, you know, right now\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Continuing resolutions.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Continuing resolution, was going to go, okay. That means we're going to continue what we've been doing, and nothing new, nothing different. And that's a very, very poor way of running a government, a very expensive way of running a government, because you should be making some adjustments to make things smoother and better and- and things of that sort. Especially the military. It's very difficult in the military. But they were going to go to March. They wanted to wait. That's what Mike- Mike Johnson, the Speaker, wanted to wait until, I think, after his January 3 election for Speaker, because he's on the thin margin here, and they're just- they're just basically, I mean, just stone cold, they just can't do anything. And that one vote vacate, he's always threatened by just one Republican and say, well, if you don't do what I want, I'm going to go ahead and- and ask for a vacation- a vacate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To oust the speaker.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: To oust the speaker, and he can be threatened with that, and that just shuts everything down. So you only have a two vote threshold over there. I think 20- 220, is what they have, 218. But what gets me- it blows my mind. They won't even think about- I know there'd be moderate centrist Democrats, 10, 15, 20 that would have no problem voting for Mike Johnson to help him, but they're saying, oh no, no, the Democrats will extract too much. Well, if you have 200 Republicans and 10 or 15, or 20 Democrats, I think they'll be more than reasonable just being able to participate, because over there, majority rules.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems, though, the direction is coming not from the elected members, but from the outside. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, was the one who came out against this short term funding deal, and then the President Elect also said, he's- that he's not on board. He's not even in office yet.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think what they looked at as they started getting into the bill, what's- the agreement was made on a continuing resolution, but\u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This 1500 page bill that had other\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, [cross talk] that was agreed upon. There was- that went through all the spending. And you know, Elon's coming in as the new DOGE czar and- and looking at that. So wait a minute, why are you doing that, when it's behind the eight ball before we start? They're- they're looking at all these things here. What they don't\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think these are regional- these are reasonable objections?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No. I can understand where they're coming from. Did I say they're reasonable? No. This Congress, 118th Congress. First of all, Mike Johnson and the Republican leadership in the House has to come to grip that's the worst performing Congress in the history of our country. That means lack of production. And I say that because most of the time there's been about 500 bills that have been passed, and every two year, it's 117th Congress, one of the most productive. 118th was not, they become in charge again. But because of that thing that you went through with Kevin McCarthy, how all that unfolded and what it left them with, they have been just tied in knots and can't get anything through. And they- they will not reach out and work for- with Democrats to continue to have a majority with some bipartisanship. If they can't get over that hump, and if Democrats can't get over that hump, that they've got to work with Republicans, when they're in charge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats did come to a bipartisan agreement on this short term spending deal, and then the President Elect said, no deal.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Right, right. So\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Democrats were working with Republicans on that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, oh no, this last deal that was made here. Mike Johnson shouldn't have done an extension to March, okay, with the CR. We should have finished out. The Senate had all appropriation- 12 appropriation bills done, working with Patty Murray and Susan Collins. Those are two wonderful senators that really worked hard and did their job. And then, boom, nothing happens. And Schumer, for whatever reason, didn't put them on the floor. Should have, we should have had our package altogether. That's all doable. But I would have thought they would have finished out this year, the 118th Congress, and President Trump comes in and starts his new term on the 20th of January. That'll be the 119th Congress. But they're looking at things, they don't want to be strapped with certain things. And they- they- they have a lot of input, let's put it that way, an awful lot of influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- you are an independent and you are independent minded.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Always have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you will object at times to\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014to what the party direction is. Will you support whatever it is that Senate leadership says Democrats should be on board with, if it's to keep the lights on?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Let me make sure you understand. I will never vote to shut down the government. There's no reason. There's- you have no excuse in the world just because it's not the right thing, not perfect enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't that mean that the Senate will just have to swallow whatever it is the House sends up here?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much- pretty much, you're in a situation now, they just want to get out of here and not let the government shutdown and live to fight another day. I can see what's coming now. So my vote, or anybody's vote, right now, I think they're going to come to an agreement. They'll swallow hard, say, let's go home for Christmas. That's what's going to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So whatever it is that gets sent here by the House\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much, whatever it is right now, no matter what they have to do to skinny it down, they're not going to fight. There's not much fight left. Okay? The die has been cast. The election of November pretty much set the die where it's going. So whether you do it now and fight to the death now, it's going to be changing anyway when President Trump brings his new administration in. So they're just trying- President Trump and him are just trying to wield their power right now, and they have that influence with the Republican delegation, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President Elect has now publicly called for the debt ceiling to be dealt with. Not clear if he wants it\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014completely eliminated or lifted. It won't happen? Well, he says it has to be part of this deal before he takes office January 20.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't see the Democrats, basically- and this is going to be from a bipartisan standpoint. You have to have bipartisanship here, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll need 60 votes in the Senate to do this.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's exactly right. And you've got 51 Democrats right now. So if you had all 49 Republicans, you'll need 11 Democrats to raise that debt ceiling. I just don't see getting the votes to do that. My reason for saying that is that's going to have to be, the Republicans do it when they take over with- with the trifecta, if you will. They're saying is, well, this debt we're getting from- from everybody that you've given us to us, and why won't you raise it now so we can go ahead and just do our work? Well, if you're going to do all the thing with DOGE, and you're going to be in charge of all of the rearrangement of government, and trying to look at the waste, fraud and abuse in government, then you shouldn't, maybe have to raise that right now, you know. So- but if you do, you have to justify why you're doing it. I would think that would be their thought process. I'm not sure what they're going to end up with. But I don't see an appetite, and I have not heard an appetite of that being thrown in. Yesterday was the first time we heard about that, and that being thrown in right now to the mix, it's either this or nothing. I don't know how they're going to get over that one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the President Elect understands the political realities that you are talking about, that there aren't the votes?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think he understands- he understands it an awful lot better now than he did in 2016 when he won the first time. So now he's had- he's got- got some experience under him. He understands the process and- but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has with the Republican congregation or delegation, if you will. On the House and the Senate. The Senate has always been more dependent- independent. Senators are independent to a certain extent. The six year term makes you\u00a0 a little bit more independent, so you have that to deal with. But on the house, it's every two years, the whims and wishes of the person that's setting and if they're popular at the White House, makes it almost impossible for them to- to fight back hard, or sit down and work out a really tough agreement that the President wouldn't be on board for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been pushing to make it easier or less burdensome for energy companies to be able to drill, this permitting reform that you've been pushing.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, all types of energy. What I- what we did, Margaret, we did- we did a permitting- we were working on a permitting bill, the John Barrosso, Republican, and I worked together for over a year and a half trying to work through the nuances of trying to say, okay, you have to produce energy that this country needs to operate on our economy, and also be able to defend ourself with our military. That comes from fossil fuels. Renewables is a direction that there's- we'd like to be able to go with technology that will lets- they give us the energy with less carbon emissions. So we looked at everything, and only thing that we said, we came to this permitting bill, how can we produce the energy we need today and continue to invest and not waste money, but invest in technology we- for the energy we want for tomorrow? That's what the bill did. And with that, we had, I mean, a really great bill that came out of our committee, 15 to 4, never happened before. So you would think that it would be a slam dunk. Here we have something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it didn't make it into that short term (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And you would think that President Trump, I was hoping, and I tried everything I could to talk to him and make sure they understood: this bill will allow you to do what you want to do, produce the energy that this country needs. We're producing more energy than anybody in the world. People don't realize that. And you never heard\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Record levels. Record levels of output of oil and natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2014record levels, and you never heard- you never heard President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, and even when she was running for president, until a couple weeks before the election they even acknowledge it. They never did acknowledge that with the IRA, we paid down $230 billion of debt. That was part of the bill. Never talked about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think they were\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: They just couldn't, because it wasn't where they were. They were forced. I wrote the bill, energy portion, and it forced them to have a balanced energy position, and- and then they were just going balls to the wall, to the- with the EVs and everything else. And I told them it was completely wrong. They were way ahead of their skis. We were trying to bring the manufacturing and also the production and- and supply chain with critical minerals back to the United States, or with our free trade agreement countries, there will be reliable supply chains. Right now, they cut everything in half. The rules were absolutely horrible, and I've been fighting them ever since. And I think maybe the President Trump can clean that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't see this latest proposal from you, making it into some 11th hour deal to avoid a government shutdown?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: If the President Trump would- if President Trump would actually say to Mike Johnson, I need that permitting bill. I need that permitting bill to do what I've got to do. If he thinks he wants to raise this- the debt ceiling because he doesn't want to be encumbered about how he wants to operate, I can tell you he's going to be tied in knots wanting to do that, the drill, baby drill, or basically producing more, because you just can't. You have to be able to have leasing permits, and you have to go through a rigmarole thing. And the court systems are so, so onerous, to the point to where it's almost impossible. We cut all that burden out. We basically still are very concerned about the environment, but if you're going to have a problem, tell me up front, don't wait to six years and sue me later. We did judicial reforms, a lot of things that really accelerated us being able to meet the challenges and the energy that we need in the next five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were spotted at that Army-Navy game\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, I was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-speaking to Donald Trump.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I made a point to be there. I was\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking to him about exactly this. Premitting reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I did. Well, he had so much going on. I had a chance just to mention this. I hope you really think about this and- and I'm sure he had so much more- x",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: We'll watch",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: You never know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you reached out to Mr. Trump since last weekend on this?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I haven't, I haven't talked to him. They've got- I think they got a lot on their plate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: This is important though. I hope- I'm going to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were speaking to us on \"Face the Nation\" last January, and we were talking about what was happening and the election cycle, and you were spending time on the campaign trail, you said, 'I love my country too much to vote for Donald Trump\u2026I think it would be very detrimental to my country.' He's the president-elect. Do you think he is detrimental to America?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Here's the thing I've said, you know, I said basically what I had known from the four years before. January 6 was a bridge too far for me and I think everyone knows that. I had a good relationship with him, you know, when he was- when he was the president, and we worked together. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him, and we always got along great, we're very friendly. We used to have disagreements on some things, but you can do that. I've said this, Margaret, I mean it all my- all my heart, when the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray everything you have the president will be successful. And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. Don't worry about well, did you vote or not vote for him? Did you- did- is that in your same party that you're in, or whatever? Forget about that. This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've talked about the need to return to bipartisanship and regular order. Donald Trump is promising to destroy regular order. Upend the system.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I- I have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I have- I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that will not let that happen. They have the chance. They have the power. Here's the thing. We have three branches of government. Bob Byrd used to tell me all the time, he says, Joe, he says, the president's not my boss, he said, and the majority leader is not my boss. The people of West Virginia are my boss. That's who I work for, and for the betterment of our country, as long as you keep that, what's your purpose of being here? And I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart. They're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to and override the parliamentarian and play some rough games. I don't think they will do that. And it only takes five, or it takes four, I'm sorry, it takes four Republican senators, just four, and I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That'll- that'll protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around, and in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's- it's the power of the people. People go to the polls however this thing comes out. So with that being said, they're not going to put themselves in a position. I faulted my Democrat colleagues for always, as soon as they got a chance, they wanted to get rid of the filibuster, and they know I was dead set- I'd do anything I could to stop that from happening, because I thought that was the Holy Grail of keeping democracy. That, and not allowing the reconciliation to be used every day they want to for basically policy-making. That's not what it's for. The reconciliation process was for keeping our finances in check, and we have done a horrible job on finances in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans a once-in-a-generation investment in border security, but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes, using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So with 51 votes, not the 60. You're saying right now, that this is- this is not how the system is supposed to work.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Hold on Margaret, if he's going to have to show the financial connotation, and the cost is- it's costing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And then step two is tax reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds- falls\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah. Well, here I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically when you've given up that you can't work with the other side. They come out of the box that way. So this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the- the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's damaging to the institution.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, it's damaging from the standpoint, if you don't think that you want, you want to do it alone, I'm going to give you a chance to prove to me you won't work with me. I'm not just going to come out the box Margaret. I know you won't work with me, so I'm going to do this. Obviously, I'd put it- put it, and I've said this to President Biden, please put it in the committee of jurisdiction wherever it falls within, whether it's Finance or whether it's",
      "Energy or wherever it may be, and then put the shot clock on us. Say, guys, you got- you got 60 days to make this happen, and if they shut you down, they'll prove to you they don't want to work with you. Then you do what you got to do, but don't come out of the box that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting, that was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. But I guarantee it. We did majority of all that bill. We wrote that bill in my committee, and I guarantee I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I feel, no I feel horrible about that. We had to do it in reconciliation. I felt horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. From the standpoint of more investments, more offshore coming back to the United States for manufacturing, we didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3%, we brought down gas prices from 5 to $3. We did all of that, but the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic, the prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort made this almost unbearable for people to the burden they were carrying. The thing that the IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President Elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. I think there is some things that need to be fixed in it because of how and I've said, you heard me say this many times, when you pass a piece of legislation and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it. So okay, if you're going to put out incentives and tax incentives, it goes to IRS. Well, if the White House says, I want this type of interpretation that makes it very very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. And I have told them many times with President Biden and with Mr. Podesta, these are all good people I know, friendly with very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The energy advisor.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Energy advisor, I said you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way, in spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals we're still depending on China when we're supposed to be weaning ourselves off of China. He can fix that immediately. President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He, and then change, change the bill. It'll be his- it'll be his energy bill, but\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Reprogramming absolutely\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there tax credits for nuclear bio fuels. Do you think parts of- you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think it almost has to. The investments are made, and most of the investments, the majority of the investments, are made in what you would consider red states, Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013They couldn't talk about it, he was talking\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, Can't you just exact- tell what the bill did? They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. Only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything for renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running. Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So I said we're going to produce what we need. We do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now, 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil. You wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill that he can change it. Change the name. It'll be his. I'll help any way I can.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, we've replaced, Margaret, an awful lot of the- this the foreign Russia fuel coming into NATO ally, our country in Europe. We replaced that because of this. But the bottom line is, I don't know where we- the tipping point would be. We're going to be up to about 26 billion cubic feet a day. We're going to double where we are. 2016 we had zero. This is where- how far we come. And with that, we've been able to keep the gas prices fairly reasonable and low in America, there's still two and a half $3 in MCF, million cubic feet of gas, which is extremely, very reasonable. Other countries are paying 12, 13, 14, 15 dollars for the same amount of gas. So we have been awash in gas. I have not seen the final report, and they wanted to start curbing it and say we're going to stop LNG, remember that? A Pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the Biden administration said they were pausing for review\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013So I said, oh no, that doesn't make any sense at all. Give me the report that shows me what the reserves we have left, what the domestic demand is going to be, and if we have the reserve to help our allies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. Okay? My Democrat friends are all so far off the rail. Okay, I love them all. But I say guys- but a lot of them really understand it, they just can't speak it because the base has gone so far, and that's I just I couldn't take it anymore.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Thank God for ranked choice voting. Without ranked choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the people of America want to get the best quality, the best character of a human being, they want to represent them so you can continue to enjoy this great domestic, what we call this great democracy ours, which is a representative form. We're still an experimental stage. We're responsible for putting the person that's going to represent us to run this government. You've got to get the best person there. But if the parties shut it down, which they've done, which is Heather, my daughter, we're working on Americans Together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And that Americans Together is basically saying-we're trying to teach every state how you can open your primaries up, how you can look at your districts for gerrymandering, how you can get more people participating. And that's exactly if the democrat and republican party control the primaries, they can control you up here. Because basically you have a hard time winning unless they unless the leadership of both sides, Democrat and Republican, are supporting you, putting their weight and their finances behind you. So they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So I'm going to find somebody else that I can control",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And she's explicitly saying\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013She's telling you exactly the- but they'll not get her because, you know why?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Too many good Alaskans that are Democrats or independents understand the quality of Lisa Murkowski",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who else is going to stand up to the president-elect when they disagree and be willing to say so out loud? Are there other senators up here who will do it?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would hope. You know, my father used to tell me, if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're okay. If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I know it's something, could I work with you and maybe- people have to try a different approach. I mean, I had, I had no problem talking to President Trump when he was, you know, I would just say, I'm not sure that's going to work, and maybe we could try something else. I never just say, Oh, you're wrong. You don't go, you can't start out a conversation that is going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end. If I tell you, that's a pretty good idea, Margaret, could we work on it together, make it a little better?\u00a0 I'm telling you, I can't do what you want me to do. I'll work with you, make it better. You're going to say, Oh no, Joe, it's got to be the way it is. If you're telling me that you're making a political statement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you also serve on armed services. You've said the Afghanistan withdrawal was one of the major failures\u2013",

And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he wants the resignation of every single military officer who touched the Afghanistan disaster on his desk by noon on Inauguration Day. Presidents make policy, officers execute it. Do you think there should be retribution, or whatever holding to account means?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I pray to God he doesn't do that. I hope that was just campaign rhetoric. You can't do that. You can't do that, Margaret, basically\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013He says he's going to at noon.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, let's just pray to God he doesn't. You know, things change around here pretty quickly. And the thing I'm saying is this, he's going to be the commander in chief. He's going to give orders, and I guarantee the military will take the orders and take them very well. I am so impressed. And just this amazes me, the military might that we have, but also it's ingrained in them, especially if you ever go through the military academies and people come up through ROTC, and all the people that are really in tune with who we are and the purpose of serving. They're not going to go off it. They do not try to make policy decisions. They will not jump into it. But they're thinking, there are some, well, there's going to be some, you know, that sometimes speak out that maybe shouldn't, but they did, and they've targeted and this and that, and we've had a few generals that have left the ranks because of those reasons. But I can tell you, I can assure you, the military that we have, have followed the private course of what we've dictated our geopolitical course that we're taking, and they've been very good at doing that. The mistakes have been made, even though they see those mistakes. So the people that basically were following orders of the extraction in Afghanistan- first of all, I couldn't believe that we'd just up and leave. I thought we would at least keep Bagram Air Force Base and have that established base, which is an unbelievable value to us, and keeping a little bit of peace in that part of the world. Working with- you can work with the Taliban, whoever you want to over there, but the bottom line, that was a show of force that we had. We could work and help people and do a lot of good from there. We just didn't have to tell them how to live their life and what they should be doing. That's the problem. But when they get out the way they did, that left a mark on us, and it help- it hurt. It reverberated around the world. And the geopolitical unrest that we were kind of on the tinder belt box anyway, it just kind of says, oh, look what's going on. Let's go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken about your friendship with Joe Biden for many, many years. That was tested during this presidency.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When was the last time you spoke with him?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It was before the campaign. It was before the campaign, before he made his decision, before the- probably before, I'm just trying to think, probably before the debate, probably\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: before June.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: His debate, probably it's been a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A consequential debate at the end\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, and I mean, I just, I still think, think he's a very good person. I still like him and Jill and their family just tough. This is a tough situation, okay, but the bottom line is I still, when I spoke, I would still speak to him with respect, and I would do it in a way that I thought would be helpful. I think to be against something means, okay, what do you have better. If I was against what he was doing in energy, I thought I had something better that could help him with. If I was with something of public policy or a policy that they have taken, I'd have to have a better idea. And where I came from had to be more common sense. I had to go home and explain it. And I only think I've told everybody up here. If you want to know, I can tell you exactly. I cannot go home and explain this. And I think you know what that means. I'm not voting for it. I'm telling you up front, so don't be don't be all caught off guard and get excited when you see me get on the floor and vote for something. Oh, Manchin, killed it. No, no. You killed it because you brought it up. You knew you didn't have the votes before you brought it up, but you want to make a show, and you want me to be the bad guy. I know what you're doing, and I've been doing that for far too long, and they should never bring some of the people what they brought for confirmation, which I said, You do not have my vote. Without my vote, you can't pass them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Wall Street Journal has a report about how the White House insulated Joe Biden during his presidency, largely shielding him from the press and not giving him access to lawmakers. They cite you in the article as spending time one on one with President Biden, but in it, you're cited as noticing he lacks stamina and relied on his staff to drive the agenda more than other presidents you had worked with. Do you think that they were concealing the president's decline?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't know how they got that conclusion. I never had a problem sitting and talking with him, and in fact- and the matter of fact, when we start negotiating, he knew that I was against the American rescue plan the way it was coming out, going to reconciliation. And he wanted to talk to me and everything. And when I walked in after he heard that I might be opposing that he's- I said something at 10 o'clock in the morning, by two o'clock, I'm sitting in the Oval Office. And when I came in, hey Jojo, how you doing? We got to talk. So if he says, Hey Jojo, I know things are pretty good. If he's a Joe, come in here. I want to talk to you. I know it's going to be a little bit more- little bit more tense. Depends how he approaches that. Okay, so with that I walked in, you made everybody leave the room, everybody just me and him, and that's when I said, Mr. President, I'm begging you not to do this. You're coming out assuming that Republicans won't work with you, and you were the only one on the stage saying you knew how to make things happen, because you were the deal maker. I know that. I watched it. Now, all of a sudden, you're coming out of the chute, throwing a nuclear bomb. I said, Please don't I said, make them prove they don't work with- with you first. But I said, Let's gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go. I said, Well, okay, and I've always been differential to a president, same as I'm differential to any president that wants to put their staff together. They have someone as long as they're qualified and don't have any nefarious problems that we will find out in a deep dive. That's why you should have FBI reviews. No matter who they are. You need to know. Senators need to know that. I guarantee you they don't want to go into this naked. Democrats and Republicans don't want to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's a mistake for the Trump administration to bypass the FBI background checks.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I can guarantee you one thing, the senators will get their own FBI report. They're not going to let it go. They're not going to make a decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All of them on Armed Services, not just leadership?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN:\u00a0 I would think that everyone- I would think that everyone understands how critical that advise and consent is. That is what you've got, and that's a purpose and a reason for that. But anyway\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind when you say that? Who's background check do you think needs to be reviewed? Who are you concerned about?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I mean, you know Tulsi. I know Tulsi Gabbard. I like Tulsi as a person. I just don't know all the other things have happened over the years. You follow me? But I knew when she was first here in Congress, and I came here as a senator and- and we had, you know, because she was moderate, very modern, centrist, we had a lot in common back then, when we could talk about different things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Pete Hegseth.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pete, I don't know well. I don't know Pete that well. And you want to make sure he has the qualifications, and if the President thinks he does, I would, you know, I don't have a bit of problem. Once the presidents pick their team, I'll tell you the reason why. That's will and pleasure. They come and go with the President. They're not hanging over to another president who has to inherit these people. So you always when I was governor, I used to go tell the state senator you might not know the people I'm bringing on board. Do your- do your do your investigation. If you find nothing that they've not done, they're a good character, might not be somebody you know or you like, but they have the qualifications. I have faith in them. Give me a chance to work with him, if not throw us both out. That's how I look at it. So anytime a president asked me something, I said, so I finally just had to tell President Biden, I said, Are you asking me as your friend and as my president to get on the American rescue plan? And he said, Yes. I'll do it one time. That was it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. How are you going to influence politics from outside the Senate? And do you regret not running for president yourself?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would have loved to have had a platform that I could speak, which I think is pretty centrist common sense, where most people in America are, and maybe I could have done this. Could I have won or not? Who knows? Could I put a team together that I could show that could responsibly govern, taking consideration that you have to be fiscally responsible and you can be socially compassionate, but you can run it- run your household, and you can run your country with compassion, but also being responsible. And right now I'm saying we're throwing caution to the wind on both of those. So with that, I could have brought that to a level in a discussion that maybe bring the extremes back. You know, the extremes have never run the parties, but the extremes are running the parties now and then they're closing and shutting everything down, open the process up. I had to fight when I was secretary of state of West Virginia to have open primaries. I wanted to basically- independents couldn't vote in a Democratic primary in West Virginia when I became Secretary of State, that's because we already had all the Democrats at 75% Democrat state. They said, why do we have to do anything? We don't need those people. I said, You mean you're going to sit back and allow the Republicans open the primary up, to allow an\u00a0 independent come in, says, I'd like to vote, and they're going to say, well, you don't even vote for the Republicans because the Democrats won't allow you. I finally got to change that. But you have to open this process up. If you want a representative form of democracy to work in this experiment of 240 years, then let's do it the right way and let people participate and have some say, and have a better quality of candidate or more selection, if you will.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: The boat's gonna stay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you going to use the boat for?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I got on the boat. Everybody wants a boat, so yeah, and we're all gonna come down. I promise you that we'll do that. But here's what. Last night, we had a big dinner with D's and R's, 5 D's and five R's. And I said, guys, the only thing I can tell you is I'm leaving. I'm leaving, but I'm not going that far away, because I want you all to have a place. And we did so many good things in that boat. We got so many discussions. We got through so many problems. And I said, you know, you get four D's, four R's whatever. Only thing I'm going to tell you, the boat will be available to you, but you've got to bring a person from the other party when you come. So if you want to bring five of your D's down, or you'll be five R's, then bring five D's, and we'll take care of the rest. I'll have you down there, and we'll come down. And once I get through the gate and get on the boat, nobody can bother. Nobody hears them, nobody you never heard any conversations or any bills came out of that boat. But a lot did, and we had a lot of good friendships came out that boat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that's going to be possible in this environment?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I'm trying. I'm trying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That it's not too toxic for Democrats to work with Donald Trump?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's never too toxic for people to get together and enjoy a little vibration, vibration and vibration. (laughing) Enjoy, enjoy getting together. And I tell you this on the boat, the most beautiful thing we do, no matter what we do that night, we have, we have some- some- some refreshments. We have some food. But before we leave, we always put Lee Greenwood on, \"Proud to be an American,\" and we all stand up and hug each other, I can tell you that. So if I can keep that alive, I've done something.",

      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you. This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did. Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines. Won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the President's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page. Because with narrow majorities, we've got to work together, and that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Marc Short, who was the Director of Legislative Affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025. What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, want to use the budget reconciliation process that's still -still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of the Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business, having access to capital. So, I think we're on the same page, and I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REP. HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that year when we last year in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security, for an all the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on, we are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor as well as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on US investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies. Your Democrat colleague Rosa DeLauro insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual-use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the America's- America's national security, but striking that balance has been difficult, but I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people, a majority of members, clearly wanted a simple, straightforward continuing resolution, and not of what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR. So, I think President- I mean, Speaker Johnson, did a good job coming back around from that focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast, farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with majority leader Thune, on how we would tackle reconciliation, to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. It's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing Chair of House Financial Services was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders. Take a listen.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "REP. PATRICK MCHENRY: For us to have no women chairs of committees is a huge mistake and really an unfortunate thing, because we have powerful, smart, capable, tenacious Republican women, that are capable of leading big committees and doing major things.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REP. HILL: Well that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica de la Cruz of Texas, and we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan our conference- our conference Chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from South Florida, joining our committee. They will be active leaders in financial services policy making.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly. I know you've been trying to restrict captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "FRENCH HILL: Well, we need the United States to be very active work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime, as it relates to all the people murdered, killed in prison, tortured in the- from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that, but it needs to be stopped. But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict captagon and cut off the funding, because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that. Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well. A source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow, the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former congressman Matt Gaetz alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. last month on this program, you said 'it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.' Do you still object?",
      "FRENCH HILL: That's not- well I don't know that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are- they have released documents before, but I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution, because you open up a Pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025? Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. TONY GONZALES: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after President elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line. Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid March. You were one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's pretty simple, my- my constituents were against the CR just as much as I was against the CR. This- it's been a tough week, though. It started with a tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I've worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I've been working with others to get that done. I think that's important. And then in the house, of course, we have this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1500 page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in DC, and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills. You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though he was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is I think CRs are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Right, that's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, 'Hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job.' We've ran that play before\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Yeah.",
      "REP. GONZALES: In my eyes, you use Christmas, you use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, 'let's get it done now.' There's also a bigger danger to this too, is if we're not funding the government long term, now all of a sudden you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well. So basically, it was- it was a vote on my end to say, 'let's do our job.'",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those, those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the CR, but I want to ask you about the dynamic here, because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the Speaker of the House. At- what role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels like as if Elon Musk is our prime minister. And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -unelected.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Unelected, But I mean, he has a voice, and I think a lot of the large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these- a 1500 page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order. The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over the spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing? They were- they were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united, and it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal. Do you support him if- he's standing for reelection should he still lead the party if you're saying he was leaning in the wrong direction with a 15 page, initial, funding deal?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yeah, and I do, I do support Speaker Johnson, I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats in the house, right? So that's a tough job to begin with, but the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with the, you know, with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members, to find a solution, just goes to prove that he's found a way. But they're also- this can't be the norm. This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the CR is, this cannot be the norm, that we have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills. Homeland Security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention. Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July, and there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81 year old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public. Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I wasn't aware. I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining an age, like a lot of members do. And sadly, you know, some of these members wait until it's too long to things have gone too far\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I think it's- maybe, I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it. I'd say on the other side of the aisle is the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side, you know, with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time. I think this goes- gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job, and if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there, and apparently it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows. I need to get to the border, because that is what 800 miles of the border\u2013",
      "REP. GONZALES: -that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your district. Border patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low. Does that mean coming into office that essentially, the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Oh no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has has started to do some things right. The Trump administration is going to do everything right in this manner. And I'll tell you why, this is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat, the worldwide threats to homeland, to our homeland. I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I'll share some of the open source stuff. In Syria, a lot of us are rooting for a free Syria. Free Syria, it brings a lot of opportunities for- for stability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy, he imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully. Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going? Let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists? Of course not. But do we know who these people are, and who- are they coming to our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about, you want to block travel from Muslim majority countries? Like the Trump team is talking about.",
      "REP. GONZALES: I want the president- I want the President to enforce the laws that we have on the books. That simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, those aren't laws on the books. Refugees are, except in the United States of America.",
      "REP. GONZALES: And they should be right. I want us to follow our laws right. And if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes. And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming. We want people to come and live the dream- those that are fleeing political persecution, but we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Merry Christmas 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute."

      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the social media rhetoric \"extraordinarily alarming\" that followed the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson earlier this month, warning of the risk of violent extremism it poses.",
      "Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he's \"alarmed\" by the \"heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City,\" as the the insurance executive's killing in midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4 has prompted scattered celebration on social media \u2014 and lionizing of the man charged in the deadly shooting.",
      "\"It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspect, faces federal charges including murder. Investigators' working theory of the motive is animosity toward the health care industry. On social media, support for the suspect has materialized surrounding grievances toward perceived inequalities in the insurance and health care systems.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you broadly about the environment we are in. It's a pretty significant one. Your potential successor, Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's pick to run Homeland Security, has no law enforcement experience and has never worked at an agency like this. Have you spoken to her yet? And what do you think her biggest challenge will be?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I have. I have spoken with the governor. We had a very positive conversation. We are both perfectly aligned on our dedication to a smooth and effective transition. I care very deeply about the well-being of this department, dedicating so many years to public service, she expressed her dedication to the well-being of this department. She is a governor, so she knows how to lead, and I am optimistic and hopeful and dedicated to her success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been hiccups with transition so far, in terms of even just the information that is being shared because of these lack of signing off on paperwork at certain government agencies. What is it going like? How smooth is it here?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Here, the transition team has landed at the Department of Homeland Security. We have begun to produce documents and provide information to the transition team. I happened to run into the transition team leader yesterday here at DHS headquarters and- and we are working well together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a sense yet of what things will be like? You said you're worried about the department. There's a vow to cut back on bureaucrats. Do you think a lot of these workers that you say you're dedicated to won't have jobs in a few months?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh, I hope that's not the case. We are, quite frankly, a perennially under-resourced department. You know, people take a look at our budget and, and think about how big it is, but one has to measure how big it is compared to what the mission demands are, and those mission demands are incredibly vast. Our department is a sprawling one. Our mission is extraordinarily diverse. Of course, the border receives a great deal of attention, but the cyber security challenges, the criminal investigative work that we perform, the disaster response that we execute, maritime security, our United States Coast Guard, our protective mission by United States Secret Service. We were speaking earlier of TSA and so much more. Our department- the challenge for the governor coming in is to address such a diverse set of missions, but fortunately, she will be able to rely on extraordinarily dedicated and talented experts in this department. We cannot afford to lose any.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a heightened threat environment on the foreign front, on the domestic front, we recently saw that killing of the United HealthCare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan. Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, Margaret, it's not for me to comment on a pending criminal case, I will not do that. First of all, let us take a step back and note the tremendous tragedy. A father of two children, a family man was murdered in New York City in cold blood, first and foremost. Secondly, you spoke of the heightened threat environment, the rhetoric on social media following that, that murder is extraordinarily alarming. It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter. Of course, there's also the threat of foreign terrorism, as well as the actions of adverse nation states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I- look we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And that's against CEOs, that's against the government, that's against leadership.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances in the language of violence, accompanying or being a part of those narratives, is something that we're very concerned about, that, that is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the the the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the healthcare industry and what that company was doing, it's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: And and the victim is a person\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you about a trend, because often these things are discussed in purely political terms, as political violence, but it seems like you're saying it's almost broader.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh it is. It is. It is not purely a political rhetoric. We see a wide range of narratives that's- that really drive some individuals to violence, and we have a responsibility to know the threat landscape and see what we can do working with communities to prevent that violence from actually occurring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean there were reports during the hurricane aftermath in North Carolina about militias looking for FEMA workers, for federal response workers.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: So we had to pull FEMA workers out of the field who were responding to victims' needs because of false information that was deliberately disseminated on social media, such as, 'the FEMA worker is coming to take your land.' Absolutely false. They are there at great personal sacrifice to help others. That's who they are. And we had to pull them from the field by reason of that threat environment, temporarily, albeit, but nevertheless impactfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That just shows a massive not just distrust- but you were worried about the threat of violence against them",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We most certainly were. And I have to tell you, the FEMA employee who is engaged in a search and rescue mission does not ask about the political party of the individual whom that FEMA employee is rescuing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, should not.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is- and does not, and that is a rescue operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We mentioned how broad your portfolio is. So I want to move to another part of that, the US border. 'Face the Nation' has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers. And I don't think- I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents. Why is it so hard to reunite families, and how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force, a multi-agency effort that I led here in the Department of Homeland Security. But there's more work to be done. Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find. Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma. So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It is unclear, because the- we were not left with good records, data was not kept, and so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome. We could not have done our work, what we accomplished, without the partnership of groups in the community that had other connections to separated families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-government agencies. ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023 according to the report we read. The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, we\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are. That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. What we do is we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children. Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking, but there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian, and they move and sometimes the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise, I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized. There are a number of reasons why we might lose track of an individual that is not necessarily specific to this administration. That has been a long standing challenge in the immigration system, one example of why that system is so broken, why the duration of time in proceedings is unacceptably long and has to be remedied. Remember, we're dealing with a system that was last reformed in 1996.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what more can you do to combat the trafficking that is happening of some of these children, or the exploitation of some of these children, is that up to Congress as well, or can Homeland do more well?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We have done more. As a matter of fact, our entire worksite enforcement strategy has been to focus our criminal investigators and our other officers on employers who exploit vulnerable individuals, including underage individuals, and take advantage of the fact they that they are migrants seeking work in the United States and pay them substandard wages, have them employed in substandard working conditions and the like. And so that is where we have, I would submit correctly, focused our energies, and we've been unprecedented in that focus and in the success of that focus. We need more resources. The problem of the-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a money problem?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We need more personnel. We certainly do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the exploitation of them, are you limited in your authorities at this point, when the Trump administration promises they will change it? Can they change it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: This was a- this has been a problem that has been decades long. This is not a new problem. I wish them tremendous success. I will support them in their efforts to end the scourge of human exploitation and human trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So at this point last year, in December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration. How much of that drop off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is critically one element of it. It is not the only element of it. The President took decisive action after politics killed what would have been an extraordinarily enduring solution to what is a broken immigration system, that bipartisan legislation that I was very proud to be a part of would have- would have really delivered a solution. Because politics killed it, the President took executive action in June of this year, we began to execute very successfully and very rapidly that executive action. And that has been a key driver of the- the low number of encounters at our border we are now delivering to the incoming administration, a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019 the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the US since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh, it is Margaret. It is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War Two. This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States. It- it is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world. When I speak to our partners from the Five Eyes, our closest allies, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, they raise immigration as the first issue of concern to them. This is something not unique to the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not and it has tremendous political impact.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It has a tremendous political impact, and that is why we need Congress to act in the- in the- in the wake of Congress's failure to act, the President took executive action, and therefore we're delivering to the incoming administration a border that is more secure than it was in 2019.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Biden administration, and I think you have said to me, one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days, and then fast forward, you had this bipartisan near miss on a border bill all that time passed, why wait until five months before the US election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow? That ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret remember where we were when the President took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prior administration had imposed title 42 which is a public health authority, and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done. There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42 which we did. Remember- and that was pressure to maintain Title 42 a bipartisan pressure that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Which was pinned on the CDC as a health measure. But sure, yes.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That held until May of 2023 and we ended the workings of Title 42 because this country had escaped the throes of COVID 19 more rapidly and more successfully than any country in the hemisphere and, quite frankly, the world. We then turned to Congress and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better. We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding. Denied, despite a desperate need for it. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics. Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Republicans argue in this back and forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis, starting at day one, when Trump-era immigration policy was peeled back. Remain in Mexico, the 100 day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction. Did those measures, and I know you weren't yet in office, personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Remember something, Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea. In 2018, and I will be approximate in my numbers Margaret, in 2018 there were approximately 550- 560,000 individuals encountered at the southern border. Remain in Mexico was implemented in January of 2019. In 2019 there were approximately 960- 970,000 individuals encountered at the southern border. The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019 and that is reflected worldwide. And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Remember something also about the executive action that the President took in May- in- in June of this year. We also, over time, built capabilities that we did not previously have. Not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world. We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four. And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case. We have been removing Chinese nationals who have no lawful basis to remain in the United States back to the People's Republic of China for the first time since 2018 and we have run a number of removal flights to that country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, on that data. So, President Obama was referred to by activists as the deporter in chief, because of the large number of deportations on his watch. But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10 year high under President Biden. A 10 year high. So what shifted at DHS that- that prompted this deportation of more than what 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year. That- that's one of the highest numbers in recent years--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS:-- Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- If Congress didn't give you the power, how did you do it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we did it with skill, with strategy, and with unflinching dedication to that mission, and let me share with you, I am an immigrant to this country, and what this country gave me drove me to public service. I spent my first 12 years in government service as a federal prosecutor, and the conclusion that I have lived and the conclusion that defines this country is the following, that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, and if individuals do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States, we will remove them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would also suggest that there is the ability to do it without Congress acting, right? That's the downside of showing you can make it work.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes- but Margaret, we made those very impressive statistics happen. But there is much more work to do, and what we have to do is to ensure that the problem does not continue. This broken system needs to be fixed. And it's not just to ensure that individuals who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States are removed, but it's also to ensure that we are providing humanitarian relief to those who qualify one of our proudest traditions, and that we are also fueling the economy. Our need for skilled labor is something that we hear from companies and public officials, regardless of party affiliation, and yet we are capped at the number of skilled workers that we can introduce into the United States economy. By figures, by ceiling set in 1996.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about H-1b visas and skilled worker visas, things like that.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the enforcement actions here, Goldman Sachs estimates more than half of the migrants since 2021 entered illegally. Does that sound right to you? Roughly 5 million people entered the US illegally?",

But we have, as you cited earlier, we have removed, returned and expelled, given the operation of Title 42 during the COVID-19 pandemic, an extraordinary number, and we continue to return or remove individuals. But there is no question, there is no question, and this is a sign of a broken immigration system- that individuals who were encountered at the border are in the United States, but they are in immigration enforcement proceedings. One of the problems is that those proceedings take seven to ten years before they're resolved, because our immigration court system is so backlogged, and that backlog has been increasing year, over year, over year, ever since I can remember and I entered the Department of Homeland Security for the first time in 2009.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Donald Trump says within the first 100 days, they're going to have a surge of resources through Congress to carry out what he is calling mass deportations. The former ICE chief Tom Homan, who used to work with you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- A lot has changed--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I love- I love this country. I've worked very closely with Tom Homan, and I'm very proud of the work that he and I performed together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he said you had a where he told Tucker Carlson, you two had a falling out over transgender policy and ICE detention facilities, and he was forced to sign something that provided medical care to them. Is that how you remember things and- and this is the person who will be part of carrying out the policies you say need to be fixed?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I was disappointed to learn of that statement that's not true.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That wasn't a falling out between the two of you?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: No, I didn't have a falling out with- with Tom Homan. We worked very well together throughout my tenure as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I was disappointed to hear that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that just politics?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I- I can tell you this, it's not true. Whatever it is, is not true.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been the recipient of a lot of upset over the immigration policy because of your job. You are the face of it, right? And the Republican House impeached you. I wonder when you leave this office, are you concerned about your personal security?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, I'm incredibly proud of the work that this department has done over the past four years as I've been privileged to serve as its secretary. I'm very sad to leave the department, and it mirrors the sadness I have felt each time. I have left the federal government as a political appointee. I started as a career appointee. I have- I have faith in the American people. That faith is when we see a cold-blooded murder of a United Health Care executive, it's- it's rattled, but that's the actions of a- of an individual not reflective of the American public and of the democracy in which we live. I am the face- I am the face of it, and that is a responsibility I willingly assumed when I agreed to take this position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, it's a question. And you know why I had to ask it because of the environment we're in. I want to ask you about China, if I could, before we go. You said recently that this massive Chinese hacking known as Salt Typhoon, the hacking of eight telecom companies that siphoned up this metadata, the phone call records, logs and information for millions, potentially of Americans, was accessed. Why hasn't the US government stopped it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, first of all, the intrusion is a very significant one and an extraordinarily impactful one and an absolutely unacceptable one. And the President has demonstrated a strong response to the People's Republic of China. It is very sophisticated--",

      "SEC. MAYORKAS: I'm sorry,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically? When he met with Xi Jinping?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, just recently, the United States Department of Commerce proposed\u00a0 an action against China Telecom. So this is an ongoing situation. It is not static. The intrusion is a very sophisticated one. The telecommunications companies are working very vigorously to remediate it. They are working in partnership with us, with the cyber security and infrastructure security agency within the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the federal government. So this is a partnership in an effort to remediate the situation. It is very complicated, and we're very dedicated to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the largest intelligence compromise, potentially in US history.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It is a very serious compromise, and requires very serious action to remediate and recover from it, and also very serious response to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you find it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is not something I can- I can speak to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The incoming national security advisor to Donald Trump, Mike Waltz was on Face the Nation last Sunday and said the US needs to go on offense, start imposing higher costs and consequences to people and entities like countries stealing data, but also to those who spy on us they are, \"literally, putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.\" A cyber time bomb. Is that what's happening?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: You- we started our discussion speaking about a heightened threat environment, and I identified three vectors, three primary vectors, the threat of foreign terrorism. And obviously we're keenly focused on the instability in Syria, and whether that can create some space for the reemergence of ISIS there. And foreign terrorism is, of course, the founding reason for our Department of Homeland Security, the threat of domestic violent extremism. And we've talked about that and I mentioned the actions of adverse nation states. It is really an extraordinary time now. Adverse nation states have exhibited a willingness to use the cyber domain in an effort to. To threaten our homeland security and our national security. The infiltration, the hack of the telecommunications companies is one example. We've seen critical infrastructure hacked as well, and it does require a response, and I am confident that the incoming administration will be vigilant in executing that response.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you put that at the top of the list for the incoming Secretary?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Would put that at the top of the list. Whether it's at the very top, I'd want to think through, but it is at the top of the list most certainly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, as you come to the time, as you come to the end of your time here, what is the thing that keeps you up at night?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we- it's not singular. It's not singular. Our mission space is so vast. Our mission is so diverse. There are challenges in each area of this department. If you asked me for an embracing concern, it is the safety and security of the American people that is our commitment, and ensuring that that is preserved and not in any way encroached upon, is our highest obligation, and I'm incredibly proud to serve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time. Thank you,",

      "As he nears the end of his presidency, Mr. Biden will close out his four years in office having appointed one Supreme Court justice, 45 judges to the federal appeals courts, 187 to the district courts and two to the Court of International Trade. His selection of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made history, since she is the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"Today, we celebrate one of the most important accomplishments of this Democratic Senate and the Biden-Harris administration: the confirmation of highly qualified, independent, and evenhanded judges to the federal bench,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, adding, \"More than one out of every four judges now serving on the judicial bench was nominated by President Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Biden has also selected a record number of public defenders to serve as federal judges on the appeals courts, and his nominees are the most diverse compared to those tapped by his predecessors.",
      "There's been heightened focus on the judiciary by presidents in recent years as gridlock in Congress has led to unilateral executive actions on a variety of issues touching on American life. But often those efforts give way to legal challenges, leaving courts as the final deciders in disputes over hot-button policies.",
      "While Mr. Biden will likely end his presidency with more judicial appointments than Trump, he did not see the same level of success as his predecessor in putting his stamp on the Supreme Court. Jackson replaced Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the court's liberal wing, following his retirement in 2022.",
      "But Trump named three justices to the high court, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal member, which locked in a 6-3 conservative supermajority.",
      "Mr. Biden also trails Trump in appointments to the 13 courts of appeals, ending his presidency with 45 judges approved to those courts, compared to Trump's 54.",
      "But Trump had an advantage when he took office in 2017, inheriting 17 appellate court vacancies after the Republican-led Senate blocked then-President Barack Obama's nominees in the last two years of his term. When Mr. Biden started his presidency, there were just two open seats on the courts of appeals.",
      "With a second Trump term on the horizon, some judges who announced their plans to retire have reversed course as it became clear their replacements wouldn't be confirmed before Jan. 3, when Republicans will assume control of the Senate.",
      "Judge James Wynn of the 4th Circuit notified Mr. Biden last week that he would no longer assume senior status, a form of semi-retirement, and the White House withdrew the nomination of his possible successor, North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park.",
      "North Carolina's Republican senators, Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, opposed Park's nomination, and Tillis lambasted Wynn's decision to walk back his retirement, calling it \"brazenly partisan\" and driven by Trump's election.",
      "Two district court judges appointed by Democratic presidents, Judges Max Cogburn and Algenon Marbley, also rescinded their plans to take senior status following Trump's victory, according to Reuters.",
      "The reversals come after Senate Democrats reached a deal with Republicans to allow for swifter consideration of Mr. Biden's district court picks. GOP senators \u2014 with Trump's backing \u2014 had been working to slow the pace of judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but under the deal, they would forego procedural roadblocks on district court nominees if Democrats would not bring four remaining appellate court nominations up for a vote.",
      "There will be four current or future vacancies on the courts of appeals for Trump to fill after he takes office and more than 30 on the district courts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.",

      "Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo ignored customer complaints related to Zelle, with users losing hundreds of millions of dollars in scams, the regulatory agency alleges. Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",

      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",

      "In 2023 Early Warning\u00a0began refunding money to an undisclosed number of fraud victims amid pressure from lawmakers. In late 2022, Sen. Elizabeth Warren issued a report that found increasing incidents of fraud and scams to be occurring on the popular payment app, with large banks typically reluctant to compensate victims, the Massachusetts Democrat said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:10:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Historians say Trump falsely said he was the only president to collect revenue from tariffs on Chinese goods, among other claims.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump made claims about the history of U.S. tariff collection as he defended his plan to raise tariffs on goods from countries like China and Mexico in a news conference this week, claims historians say are at odds with the facts.",
      "In particular, Trump exaggerated the impact of tariff hikes during his first term, falsely claiming that \"no other president took in 10 cents\" of revenue from trade collections on Chinese imports. Trump also pointed to 19th-century tariff increases championed by former President William McKinley as evidence that his plan could benefit the economy.",
      "But data shows the federal government had been taking in billions in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports long before Trump came to office, and historians say the high tariff era of the 1890s was economically rocky for Americans.",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports, often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "In his next term, Trump has pledged to put an additional 10% levy on all Chinese goods, along with a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada. Americans spend more than $1 trillion on goods from those three countries each year, according to data from the Census Bureau.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about history of tariffs on China",
      "In his news conference this week, Trump repeated a claim he made frequently on the campaign trail: that his predecessors essentially took in no money from tariffs on Chinese goods, while his administration took in billions.",
      "Tariffs on Chinese imports have existed since the 1700s, generating billions in revenue for years before Trump came into office.",
      "During President Barack Obama's final year in office, tariff revenue from Chinese imports totaled over $12 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. That amount increased after Trump's first round of tariff hikes to over $22 billion, the same federal data shows.",
      "Trump did dramatically raise the total revenue generated from Chinese imports by adding tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars'\u00a0worth of goods. However, even with that increase, tariff collections have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue at any point in the last 70 years, according to the Congressional Research Service this month.",
      "The president-elect has argued his tariff plan for his next term could bring in revenue to help defray the cost of income tax cuts.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs estimated that Trump's proposed levies on goods from China, Mexico and Canada could generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year, which would be up from $77 billion in fiscal year 2024.",
      "But tariffs had not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, said Judith Goldstein, a political science professor at Stanford.",
      "\"As the U.S. became more involved in the world, the effect of tariffs on domestic production and prices were increasingly a problem,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Trump has also repeatedly argued his tariff plan will help protect U.S. companies. There's some evidence that the customs duties he imposed in his first term boosted jobs in specific industries like washing machine manufacturing, according to research from the Brookings Institution, a think tank. However, manufacturers also faced higher costs for raw materials and retaliatory tariffs from other nations, according to the Federal Reserve.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about the McKinley tariffs",
      "This week, Trump also cited McKinley's 1890 tariff hikes as evidence that these customs taxes can enrich the U.S.",
      "\"You go back and look at the 1890s, 1880s, McKinley, and you take a look at tariffs, that was when we were proportionately the richest,\" Trump said.",
      "In 1890, tariff hikes raised the average duties on foreign imports from 38% to nearly 50%. McKinley, a representative for Ohio at the time, pushed for the taxes to protect his state's steelworkers from foreign competition, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Doug Irwin.",
      "However, the decade that followed these hikes was marked by economic trouble.",
      "\"The U.S. went into a depression in 1893, and we didn't really emerge out of it until the mid-1890s. So in general the 1890s was not a great decade for the U.S. economy,\" Irwin said.",
      "Additionally, McKinley's tariff bill raised prices of goods like shoes and clothes, leading to voter backlash that cost Republicans 93 seats in the next election, according to the House of Representatives\u00a0Office of the Historian.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for clarification on why he said America was \"proportionately the richest\" after this bill passed.",
      "Historic data shows gross domestic product per capita for Americans has vastly increased from about $6,400 in the early 1890s (in 2017 dollars) to roughly $69,000 today (in 2024 dollars).",
      "\"It is unclear why he's picking on the 1890s as this golden age. It wasn't considered good times, at least by the people living through it at the time,\" Irwin said.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:19:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

    "story": [
      "Humans aren't alone when it comes to yawning\u00a0\u2014 all vertebrates do it too, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. But why?",
      "The \"evolutionarily ancient\" act of yawning likely serves a few purposes, according to Andrew Gallup, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\"The fact that it is conserved so widely across the animal kingdom suggests that it likely holds an evolutionary function, and research suggests that it functions in a variety of domains,\" he said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0Friday.",
      "Those findings suggest yawning may have a role in promoting changes in our state of alertness or activity patterns.",
      "\"We often yawn frequently before we go to sleep or after we wake up,\" Gallup said. \"Yawns have been shown to increase arousal and alertness as associated with these state changes.\"",
      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",
      "\"It helps promote mental awareness and alertness. So when individuals yawn in an academic setting or a boardroom, it could be an indicator that they're actually trying to pay attention,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

      "World coal use is set to reach an all-time high in 2024, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, in a year all but certain to be the hottest in recorded history.",
      "Despite calls to halt humanity's burning of the filthiest fossil fuel driving climate change, the energy watchdog expects global demand for coal to hit record highs for the third year in a row.",
      "Scientists have warned that planet-warming greenhouse gases will have to be drastically slashed to limit global heating to avoid catastrophic impacts on the Earth and humanity.",
      "Earlier in December, the European Union's climate monitor Copernicus said 2024 was \"effectively certain\" to be the hottest on record \u2014 eclipsing the mark set just last year.",
      "Published on Wednesday, the IEA's \"Coal 2024\" report does, however, predict the world will hit peak coal use in 2027 after topping 8.77 billion tons this year.",
      "But that would be dependent on China, which for the past quarter-century has consumed 30 percent more coal than the rest of the world's countries combined, the IEA said.",
      "China's demand for electricity was the most significant driving force behind the increase, with more than a third of coal burnt worldwide carbonized in that country's power plants.",
      "Though Beijing has sought to diversify its electricity sources, including a massive expansion of solar and wind power, the IEA said China's coal demand in 2024 will still hit 4.9 billion tones \u2014 itself another record.",
      "Increasing coal demand in China, as well as in emerging economies such as India and Indonesia, made up for a continued decline in advanced economies.",
      "However that decline has slowed in the European Union and the United States. Coal use there is set to decline by 12 and five percent respectively, compared with 23 and 17 percent in 2023.",
      "With the imminent return to the White House of Donald Trump \u2014 who has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" \u2014 many scientists fear that a second Trump presidency would water down the climate commitments of the world's largest economy.",
      "Coal mining also hit unprecedented levels by topping nine billion tons in output for the first time, the IEA said, with top producers China, India and Indonesia all posting new production records.",
      "The energy watchdog warned that the explosion in power-hungry data centers powering the emergence of artificial intelligence was likewise likely to drive up demand for power generation, with that trend underpinning electricity demand in coal-guzzling China.",
      "The 2024 report reverses the IEA's prediction last year that coal use would begin declining after peaking in 2023.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate change forum in Dubai last year, nations vowed to transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "But its follow-up this year ended in acrimony, with experts warning that the failure to double down on that landmark pledge at COP29 in Azerbaijan risked jeopardizing efforts to fight climate change.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:32:15 -0500",
    "summary": "New analysis techniques and decades-old research helped NASA scientists identify an unusual black hole in a distant galaxy.",
    "story": [
      "NASA researchers combined years of data and new imaging techniques to learn more about a \"tipped over\" black hole that is moving in an unexpected way.",
      "The black hole is located in a galaxy called NGC 5084. Researchers have been aware of the galaxy for years, NASA said in a news release.",
      "New analysis techniques developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California helped researchers see four long plumes of plasma emanating from the galaxy. Most galaxies don't have plumes, and when they do, only one or two are present. The plumes suggested the galaxy might house a supermassive black hole, NASA said. Spotting both pairs, which formed an \"X\" shape, led researchers to focus more on the area.",
      "Using archived data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Telescope based in Chile, researchers found that the galaxy also had a \"small, dusty inner disk\" rotating at the center of the galaxy, again suggesting a black hole there. Even more surprisingly, both the disk and black hole were rotating at a 90-degree angle relative to the rest of the galaxy, meaning both features are essentially \"lying on their sides,\" NASA said.",
      "\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" said research scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff, who will also publish a paper about the discovery, in the news release. \"Putting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"",
      "It's not clear what caused the change in the galaxy. It may have collided with another galaxy and formed a chimney of superheated gas, creating the X-shaped plasma plumes. Further research will have to be conducted to learn more about the circumstances.",
      "\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" said Pamela Marcum, an astrophysicist at Ames and co-author on the discovery, in the news release. \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are stuck, but not stranded, at the International Space Station after launching into space in June.",
    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station. That won't happen until late March at the earliest so NASA and SpaceX can have more time to finish a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission, NASA said.",
      "Have other astronauts been stuck in the International Space Station before?",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two cosmonauts' six-month stay on the space station was unexpectedly extended to a year after their Soyuz ship became disabled. A replacement had to be launched up to the trio so they could return to Earth in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "Dating back a month now, you've either seen them in the sky, or you've seen them on the news: Drones seem to be everywhere. By all accounts, alleged drone sightings are multiplying exponentially, with more than 5,000 reported in just the past few weeks alone.",
      "But of those 5,000, only a hundred or so have generated actual law enforcement leads.",
      "George Mason University engineering professor Missy Cummings, who has been doing drone research for 25 years, says what most people are actually seeing are likely aircraft, stars, or reflections off of objects, like towers. \"Of all of those options, drone is the least likely, because it's actually pretty hard to pick these out of the sky,\" she said.",

      "A survey of more than 800 flight attendants conducted by UL found that 87% are concerned about lithium battery risks on airplanes, and more than a third believe airlines should do more to ensure passenger safety. While the FAA requires airlines to include general safety information in preflight announcements, those warnings often don't address the specific risk of\u00a0battery fires.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",

    "summary": "Scammers are using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to prey on people. But experts say there's a simple way to protect you and your family.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said as his time at the helm of the nation's immigration enforcement comes to a close that \"a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics\" when the bipartisan border deal fell apart earlier this year.",
      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",
      "Following the legislation's failure, the Biden administration instituted asylum restrictions that dramatically cut off the flow of immigration. When asked about the timing amid criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration possessed the authority without Congress to act on the border, Mayorkas acknowledged that the administration may have taken the action more quickly if they knew the border deal would be torpedoed.",
      "\"Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly,\" Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments come as border crossings have dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration, after reaching record highs a year ago.",
      "The Homeland Security Secretary noted that before Mr. Biden came into office, the \"trend lines of migration\" were increasing exponentially in 2018 and 2019 worldwide, \"and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\" He added over time, the Biden administration built up capabilities that have allowed it to transport individuals and decompress areas seeing surges in immigration, saying that \"we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration.\"",
      "\"We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four, and we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case,\" Mayorkas said.",

He understands the process,\u00a0 but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has\" with the House and Senate, which will be in Republican hands in January.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united. And it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal.",
      "Do you support him if \u2013 he's standing for reelection. Should he still lead the party, if you're saying he was leading in the wrong direction with a 15-page (sic) initial funding deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. And I do. I do support Speaker Johnson. I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats on the House, right?",
      "So that's a tough job to begin with. But the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with \u2013 with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members to find a solution just goes to prove that he's found a way.",
      "But there also \u2013 this can't be the norm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the C.R. is, this cannot be the norm. We have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills.",
      "Homeland security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But, right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention.",
      "Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July. And there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81-year-old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public.",
      "Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I wasn't aware.",
      "I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining in age, like a lot of members do. And, sadly, some of these members wait until it's too long \u2013 too \u2013 too \u2013 things have gone too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think it's maybe \u2013 I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it.",
      "I'd say, on the other side of the aisle, it's the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think this goes \u2013 gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there. And, apparently, it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows.",
      "I need to get to the border, because that is \u2013 you have, what, 800 miles of the border in your district.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Border Patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low.",
      "Does that mean, coming into office, that essentially the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Oh, no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has started to do some things right, the Trump administration is going to do everything right, in this manner.",
      "And I will tell you why. This is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat \u2013 the worldwide threats to homeland \u2013 to our homeland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I will share some of the open-source stuff in Syria. A lot of us are rooting for a free Syria.",
      "A free Syria brings a lot of opportunities for first ability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy. He imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going?",
      "Well, let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Of course not.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to get his thoughts on the homeland security challenges facing the new next administration.",
      "Here's part of our conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We recently saw that killing of the UnitedHealthcare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): The rhetoric on social media following that \u2013 that murder is extraordinarily alarming.",
      "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country. And, unfortunately, we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I \u2013 look, we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's against CEOs? That's against the government? That's against leadership?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances.",
      "And the language of violence accompanying or being a part of those narratives is something that we're very concerned about that. That is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the health care industry and what that company was doing. It's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And \u2013 and the victim is a person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers.",
      "And I don't think \u2013 I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents.",
      "Why is it so hard to reunite families? And how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force. But there's more work to be done.",
      "Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma.",
      "So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is unclear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 because the \u2013 we were not left with good records. Data was not kept. And so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.",
      "The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, we certainly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.",
      "That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: What we do is, we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.",
      "Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking. But there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian. And they move, and, sometimes, the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.",
      "I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration.",
      "How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is, critically, one element of it. It is not the only element of it.",
      "The president took executive action in June of this year. That has been a key driver of the \u2013 the low number of encounters at our border. We are now delivering\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the U.S. since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, it is \u2013 Margaret, it is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War II.",
      "This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you have said to me one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then, fast forward, you had this bipartisan near- miss on a border bill. All that time passed.",
      "Why wait until five months before the U.S. election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow, that ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, remember where \u2013 Margaret, remember where we were when the president took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The prior administration had imposed Title 42, which is a public health authority\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42, which we did. That held until May of 2023.",
      "We then turned to Congress, and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding.",
      "Denied. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics.",
      "Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020, if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "Because Republicans argue in this back-and-forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis starting at day one, when Trump era immigration policy was peeled back, remain in Mexico, the 100-day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction.",
      "Did those measures \u2013 and I know you weren't yet in office personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Remember something. Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea.",
      "The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019. And that is reflected worldwide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Remember something also about the executive action that the president took in May \u2013 in \u2013 in June of this year. We also over time built capabilities that we did not previously have, not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world.",
      "We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10-year high under President Biden, a 10-year high. So what shifted at DHS that \u2013 that prompted this deportation of more than, what, 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year?",
      "That \u2013 that's one of the highest numbers in recent years\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Congress didn't give you the power, how did you do it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we did it with skill, with strategy, and with unflinching dedication to that mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would also suggest that there is the ability to do it without Congress acting, right? That's the downside of showing you can make it work.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes, but, Margaret, we made those very impressive statistics happen.",
      "But there is much more work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And what we have to do is to ensure that the problem does not continue.",
      "This broken system needs to be fixed. And it's not just to ensure that individuals who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States are removed, but it's also to ensure that we are providing humanitarian relief\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to those who qualify, one of our proudest traditions, and that we are also fueling the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that this massive Chinese hacking known as Salt Typhoon, the hacking of eight telecom companies that siphoned up this metadata, the phone call records, logs and information for millions, potentially, of Americans, was accessed.",
      "Why hasn't the U.S. government stopped it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: The intrusion is a very significant one and an extraordinarily impactful one and an absolutely unacceptable one.",
      "And the president has demonstrated a strong response to the People's Republic of China. It is very sophisticated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I'm sorry,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically, when he met with Xi Jinping?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, just recently, the United States Department of Commerce proposed a \u2013 an action against China Telecom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So this is an ongoing situation. It is not static.",
      "The intrusion is a very sophisticated one. The telecommunications companies are working very vigorously to remediate it. They are working in partnership with us, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the largest intelligence compromise, potentially, in U.S. history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is a very serious compromise, and requires very serious action to remediate and recover from it, and also very serious response to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "How did you find it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is not something I can \u2013 I can speak to.",

      "Good morning to you, sir.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL (R-AR): Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you.",
      "This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did.",
      "Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines? I mean won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the president's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page because with narrow majorities we've got to work together. And that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Mark Short, who was the director of legislative affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025.",
      "What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and, again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, wanted to use the budget reconciliation process. That's still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of The Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business having access to capital.",
      "So, I think we're on the same page. And I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that last year when we - last year, in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security for an all of the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on. We are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor, as well, as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on U.S. investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies.",
      "Your Democrat colleague, Rosa DeLauro, insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation were - was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the - America's - America's national security. But striking that balance has been difficult. But I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people - a majority of members clearly wanted a simple, straightforward, continuing resolution and not what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR.",
      "So, I think president - I mean Speaker Johnson did a good job coming back around from that, focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with Majority Leader Thune on how we would tackle reconciliation to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. That's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing chair of House Financial Services, was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): For us to have no women chairs of committees is a huge mistake and really an unfortunate thing because we have powerful, smart, capable, tenacious Republican women that are capable of leading big committees and doing major things.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have a strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica De La Cru of Texas. And we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan, our conference chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from south Florida, joining our committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: They will be active leaders in Financial Services policymaking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, I know you've been trying to restrict Captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, first, we need the United States to be very active, work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime as it relates to all the people murdered, killed, imprisoned, tortured, in the - from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing Captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that. But it needs to be stopped.",
      "But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict Captagon and cut off the funding because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime. And that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that.",
      "Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well, a source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former Congressman Matt Gaetz's alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. Last month, on this program, you said it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "Do you still object?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And it's not - well, I don't know, but that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are - they have released documents before. But I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution because you open up a pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years, conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

They have the power. And I think there's enough Republican senators, and Democrat senators too. That are not going to let the filibuster blow apart, they're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to. It takes four Republican senators, just four. And I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I feel - no, I feel horrible about that we had to do it in reconciliation. I feel horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. We didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3 percent. We brought down gas prices from $5 to $3. We did all of that. But the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic. The prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort, made it almost unbearable for people to - for the burden they were carrying.",

      "If the White House says, I want this type of interpretation, that makes it very, very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. I said, you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way. In spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals, we're still depending on China when we were supposed to be weaning ourself off of China. He can fix that immediately.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: They couldn't talk about it. He was tongue tied.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, can't you just exact - tell what the bill did. They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. The only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything with renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running.",
      "Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So, I said, we're going to produce what we need, and we do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So, the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil, you wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill, then he can change it, change the name, it will be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. OK? My Democrat friends are so far off the rail. OK, I love them all, but they're - I said, guys. But a lot of them really understand it. They just can't speak it because the base has gone so far. And that's - I just - I couldn't take it anymore.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Thank God for rank choice voting. Without - without rank choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the Democrat and Republican Party control the primaries, they can control you up here. So, they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry, you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So, I'm going to find somebody else that I can control.",

If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I never did say, oh, you're wrong.

      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS (U.S. Special Presidential Envoy For Hostage Affairs): So, it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean you would almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have, like, 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing and yet in a way fascinating.",
      "But really the bottom line is that we have to help and - or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search has been exhausted.",
      "Now, in a perfect world, we're going to find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president, not long ago, said that he believes Austin's alive.",
      "Our job, in the U.S. government, is to keep pressing and pressing and pressing to find out Austin's location, his disposition, his status and to bring him home.",

Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammed al-Golani, was described by State Department officials as being very pragmatic in those meetings today. But his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorist under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with al Qaeda.",
      "Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we thought - we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So, I understand, of course, their past. What I can tell you right - is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: We came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long - the - I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. With the time that we had on the ground, it seemed to be our best shot. So, we gave it a good, hard look. We're going to review all the information and evidence that we collected, and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability. But really our job is to just to keep searching.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: So, we've had a chance to find various documents or I would even say file folders holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with the interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's going to have to be brought back. It's going to have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints. They may have traces of DNA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with. But I will tell you this, I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. People that are experts at looking at crime scenes. And they did a wonderful job of sweeping it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know back in 2020 you went there at the direction of then President Donald Trump along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: The regime, when we talked to them in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They want - they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL as we call it.",
      "I would say that at some point we came across information and that is highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken that led us to believe that at one point the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they - did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through.

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump's election is a big part of the positive outlook, especially for Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Heading into 2025 Americans are more hopeful than discouraged \u2014 and more outright hopeful than they were heading into 2024. Last year was more mixed.",
      "It does look like this very political past year is affecting that larger outlook going into next year.",
      "Among those who say they're generally hopeful about 2025, their top reason is that Donald Trump will be president.",
      "His upcoming presidency ranks even higher among things making them feel hopeful about 2025 than their outlook for their own personal relationships and finances.",
      "The hopeful group includes a lot of Republicans, underscoring the extent to which politics seems to play a role in outlook generally.",
      "And of those Americans who say they're generally discouraged about 2025 \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Democrats \u2014 their top reason is that Donald Trump will be president.",
      "That said, the new year may not see too many Americans making personal changes. Just over a third will be making New Year's resolutions, the bulk of which include \u2014 as we tend to see each year we ask \u2014 ideas around improving one's health and exercising more.",
      "For the vast majority of Americans, getting more involved in politics isn't one of them. And most will try to avoid political talk over the holidays.",
      "Economy",
      "For now, ratings of the national economy are about the same as last month, and about half of Americans say their own financial situation is good.",
      "To those who say things are bad, it's much the same story ending 2024 as it has been for years: inflation and prices are driving that sentiment.",
      "Those economic sentiments also weighed on President Biden's approval over much of his term, and his rating as he nears the end of that term remains in negative territory, about where it has hovered for a long time. There's been negative reaction to his decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden, and that tracks closely with partisanship.",
      "We've also long seen the pull of partisanship in economic evaluations, and here, people tell us about it directly. Among the (relatively few) Republicans who say the economy is good, a top answer they give for why this is the case is that Donald Trump is going to be president. For Republicans who say the economy is bad, a top answer they give about why is that Joe Biden is president.",
      "The economic lookahead on some economic aspects is net positive but also partisan. Slightly more Americans, driven by a big majority of Republicans, think Trump's policies will lower grocery prices than raise them.",
      "By two to one, more Americans think Trump's policies will lead to more U.S. technological advances than fewer.",
      "Support for tariffs, though, is sharply partisan, heavily favored by Republicans but not by most independents or Democrats. There's been a bit of an increase since November in the percentage who think tariffs would lead to higher prices.",
      "Americans also think Trump's policies are more likely to increase peace and stability in the world, more so than decrease it.",
      "Social media's reaction to killing of healthcare CEO",
      "After the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the social media and online reaction to it has itself gotten attention. Most Americans say they have seen or heard something about the social media reactions that others have expressed online, and many have seen comments from others that appear to be positive reactions.",
      "Big majorities think it's unacceptable when there's seemingly positive reactions on social media, either about the killing or seemingly in support of the alleged killer. In explaining why those posts might be happening, though, most think it is driven by people who are angry about the health insurance system, not that those expressing such sentiments are condoning violence.",

      "Lake responded to concerns by some that she might politicize the news organization by saying she doesn't care if the reporters are Democrats or Republicans, but whether they can set aside their opinions.",
      "\"I've never met anybody - they can say they're neutral, but I've never really met anybody that has not formed beliefs,\" Lake said. \"It's natural. It's normal. Can you as a journalist check this while you're covering the news? To put out a fair and accurate assessment. And so that's what I'm going to be pushing for.\"",

We've had just the worst stuff said about us.\"",

      "Erin Moriarty: How would you describe Lou Smit?",
      "Patsy Ramsey: He's my hope in finding out who killed my daughter.",
      "Det. Smit: As a detective, I'm looking for clues.",
      "What is it that convinces Smit that someone other than the Ramseys killed their 6-year-old daughter? First and foremost, the brutality of the crime. Nearly every medical expert who has seen the autopsy report agrees on one thing: this was not an accidental death. JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey was cruelly and deliberately murdered.",
      "JonBen\u00e9t was strangled not once, says Smit, but twice, with an intricately made device known as a garrote that had to have been made by the killer during the murder.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do we see here?",
      "Det. Smit: You see hair, right inside the windings of that cord; that's JonBen\u00e9t's hair.",
      "It's a device, says Smit, that was not left there for show. Whoever killed JonBen\u00e9t used the garrote to strangle her. Smit believes she was fighting for her life. There were marks that look a lot like scratches on her neck.",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 She did have her own DNA under her fingernails. I'm pretty sure that's the scratch to get that off. I think she was struggling then",
      "At some point the child was then hit over the head with such force it crushed her skull, but her nightmare wasn't over. Shortly before she died, investigators believe she was sexually assaulted with a piece of the paintbrush that was used to make the garrote.",
      "Det. Smit: There's no motive for the parent to do that.",
      "The evidence, says Smit, simply does not support the popular theory that the Ramseys struck their daughter and then tried to cover it up.",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 It's not a mother waking up in the middle of the night saying, \"Oops, I think I hurt my child. Oops, I got to bring her downstairs and fashion one of these things. And then I'm going to put it around her neck and I'm going to tighten it a couple times while she's struggling.\"\u00a0 Now, if you want to believe that, go ahead. I can't say this on the air but that's bull****.",
      "But what about those fibers from Patsy Ramsey's jacket that police say were in the paint tray and on the sticky side of duct tape covering JonBen\u00e9t's mouth?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Is the fact that there were fibers that were consistent with Patsy Ramsey's jacket incriminating?",
      "Det. Smit: Sure.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But does that shake your faith that the Ramseys were not involved?",
      "Det. Smit: No \u2026 You just can't rely on fiber evidence. Because fibers could come off with a jacket or something similar to the jacket.",
      "What's more, says Smit, there were also dozens of unidentified fibers that didn't come from the Ramseys. And Smit is unaware of a single case where a parent used a garrote to kill a child.",
      "Det. Smit: This is one of the best clues left behind by the killer. This shows what's going on in his mind. This is a sexual device. I'm looking for a pedophile that's a sexual sadist. That's what Lou Smit's looking for.",
      "Smit's not the only one.",
      "Colorado private detective Ollie Gray and his partner, John Sangustin, were hired by the Ramseys in 1999.",
      "Even when the Ramseys ran out of money, Gray and Sangustin stayed on the job.",
      "Ollie Gray: We'd probably do something on it, two or three times a week.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Even though you're not getting paid?",
      "Ollie Gray: Sure.",
      "John Sangustin: Yeah.",
      "They became convinced of the Ramseys' innocence after seeing this lab report.",
      "Ollie Gray:\u00a0 I acquired a document that you see right here that names John and Patsy Ramsey as suspects was submitted for analysis reference DNA.",
      "Just days after JonBen\u00e9t was murdered, her parents were asked to give DNA samples to the Boulder Police.",
      "Erin Moriarty: The two of you have given DNA evidence to the police?",
      "Patsy Ramsey:\u00a0 Absolutely.",
      "John Ramsey:\u00a0 Absolutely. Blood, hair, DNA, everything \u2014 we've given them everything they've asked for.",
      "Their DNA was compared to foreign DNA found under their daughter's fingernails and in her panties, which may have been left by the killer.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Does any of that DNA match anyone in the Ramsey family?",
      "Ollie Gray: No. This analysis eliminates the Ramseys.",
      "Patsy Ramsey:\u00a0 If our DNA matched anything significant, they would have arrested us in a New York minute. And don't ever think they wouldn't have.",
      "If not the Ramseys, then who killed JonBen\u00e9t?",
      "THE INTRUDER THEORY",
      "Originally aired on Oct. 4, 2002",
      "Retired homicide detective Lou Smit was still working on the official investigation when he concluded that a stranger came into the Ramsey home and killed their 6-year-old daughter.",
      "Det. Smit: This is why I believe that the killer got in. \u2026 He opened the grate, he went in.",
      "Det. Smit: There's three windows there. The center one was the one that was open. Take a look real closely at the window on the left \u2026 What you're going to see is leaves and debris pressed right up against the window \u2026 Now let's take a look at the one again in the center \u2014 no leaves or debris \u2026",
      "Erin Moriarty: Which says?",
      "Det. Smit: That window was opened. Directly below that opened window you have a suitcase\u2026. \u2026 Directly around that suitcase you have leaves and debris from that window well around that suitcase \u2026 Also see \u2014 if you look very closely, you're going to see a mark that goes right down the wall...",
      "A scuff mark that Smit believes was left by someone either climbing in or climbing out.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You can fit through that window?",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 Oh, without any problem.",
      "Det. Smit: It is much easier to go out that window if you stand on something \u2026 You put the suitcase in front, you step on the suitcase and you're right out into the window well. Lift the grate, you're gone. It's that easy.",
      "But why would an intruder who intended to kill JonBen\u00e9t leave the bizarre two-and-a-half-page ransom note written with paper and a pen belonging to Patsy? Boulder police have always believed that Patsy used it to make the killing look like a kidnapping.",
      "Erin Moriarty: But if someone had been targeting JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, wouldn't he at least bring the \u2014 the paper and the pencil to write this ransom note? I mean \u2026",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 Well, if you want to look at it from a sophisticated criminal's mind, they probably wouldn't bring it in. Why would you bring in something that could be traced back to your house where you have actual \u2014 the pen and the ink and you have the \u2014 the paper right there that it was written on?",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But you can't count on finding that in the house.",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 Can't count on it; most houses have that.",
      "Erin Moriarty: No expert could eliminate Patsy Ramsey as the writer of the ransom note \u2026 That's damning, isn't it?",
      "Det. Smit: No, not at all \u2026 You always are going to have similarities in handwriting. To sit down and write a note like that with all of those details in there after you brutally killed your daughter, you'd never done that before. Come on, give me a break.",
      "But more than any other evidence, Smit believes small marks left on JonBen\u00e9t's face and back prove an intruder killed her.",
      "Det. Smit: The killer had a stun gun. I am sure the killer had a stun gun.",
      "A stun gun, an electrical weapon used to incapacitate the little girl in order to move her to the basement. Smit believes only an intruder would need to use one.",
      "Det. Smit: There's no reason at all for the parents to have used a stun gun to help stage the murder of their daughter.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was there any indication that \u2014 that the Ramseys had ever owned a stun gun?",
      "Det. Smit: There is nothing to indicate the Ramseys ever owned a stun gun.",
      "What's significant about these injuries, says Smit, is that those on the child's face and those on her back appear to be an equal distance apart, much like the prongs of this a stun gun.",
      "Det. Smit: They're approximately 3.5 centimeters. And they're approximately 3.5 centimeters apart.",
      "Dr. Michael Doberson, the coroner for neighboring Arapahoe County, also believes the marks on JonBen\u00e9t were left by a stun gun.",
      "Dr. Doberson:\u00a0 And if I push this ... you can see the electricity arching.",
      "Dr. Doberson:\u00a0 If it's not a stun gun, I'd like to know what it is.",
      "Three other pathologists agreed, but the Boulder Police are relying instead on this man's opinion.",
      "Dr. Werner Spitz:\u00a0 They don't look ...",
      "Erin Moriarty: How sure are you that it's not a stun gun on her back?",
      "Dr. Spitz: Well, I'm 100% sure, because stun gun injuries don't look that way.",
      "Dr. Werner Spitz, a nationally known forensic pathologist who has worked on major cases including the assassination of John F. Kennedy.",
      "Dr. Spitz: A stun gun injury is a \u2014 is an electrical burn, is a burn, essentially, and these don't look like burns.",
      "Unfortunately, with only photographs to go by, no expert, not Spitz nor Doberson, can be 100% sure.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Wouldn't that have been the best way to know or come the closest to knowing is if you could have exhumed the body and line up a stun gun and see if it matches those injuries?",
      "Det. Smit: Sure. I believe that \u2014 that would have probably been the most accurate way to do it.",
      "Smit admits that in the months following JonBen\u00e9t's death, investigators considered going to court to have her body exhumed but decided against it.",
      "John Ramsey: We had buried our child. She was at peace. That was just an \u2013 a \u2014 an abhorrent thought.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But, John, that might have been the one way to know for sure. That could have resolved the whole issue. Because if a stun gun was used, it was not the parents.",
      "John Ramsey:\u00a0 No, we \u2014 certainly. And we've got people that have told us that know what they're doing that with 95% medical certainty that a stun gun was used. No question.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But you would have known with 100% certainty if you had exhumed the body, as tough as that would have been.",
      "John Ramsey: This is my child you're talking about. It's not a body. It's different.",
      "Still, Smit believes a stun gun is the key to JonBen\u00e9t's murder, and he's searching for a killer or killers who own one.",
      "Det. Smit: The person who did this, if we're right, he's still out there.",
      "A PERSON OF INTEREST?",
      "Originally aired on Oct. 4, 2002",
      "On the cold December night that marked the one-year anniversary of JonBen\u00e9t's murder, dozens of mourners showed up for a candlelight vigil outside the Ramsey home. One man in particular caught investigator Lou Smit's eye.",
      "Det. Smit: Many times criminals do return to the scene, and that was on the anniversary. That puts him right there at the Ramsey house a year later.",
      "He's Gary Oliva, a 38-year-old convicted sex offender from Oregon who lives in Boulder.",
      "Det. Smit: He definitely is a sex offender for assaulting another 7-year-old girl in Oregon. He spent time in prison for that.",
      "Smit is convinced that a pedophile came into the Ramsey home and killed their daughter.",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 On my computer I've probably got 25 good leads, and I probably have another 50 pages of other leads to follow.",
      "Among the files he's keeping on sex offenders in Boulder, Oliva's name stands out. In 1991, the year after he sexually assaulted the little girl, police reports say he tried to strangle his mother with a telephone cord. And in December 1996, Oliva may have been only a few houses away from JonBen\u00e9t's bedroom window.",
      "Ollie Gray: This is the alley that runs behind the Ramseys' home. It leads into the backyard, to the garage area.",
      "John Sangustin: It wasn't uncommon for JonBen\u00e9t and Burke to ride their bicycles around the alleyway.",
      "John Sangustin and Ollie Gray, the Ramseys' private investigators, say Oliva frequented\u00a0 buildings (in the alley) owned by a local church.",
      "Ollie Gray: You have a lot of transient people come here for food and also to pick up their mail.",
      "Erin Moriarty: But why is this relevant?",
      "Ollie Gray:\u00a0 The Ramsey home is \u2014 What? \u2014 10 houses?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Right up this alley.",
      "Ollie Gray: Right up this alley.",
      "What did the Boulder police do with this? Nothing. According to Smit, the police didn't follow up on 95% of the more than 3,000 phone tips that came in. In Oliva's case, they didn't investigate him until nearly four years after JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's death, when he was caught with drugs. And guess what else? A stun gun.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you ever use that stun gun on a child?",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 No.",
      "Oliva, who was wanted in Oregon for parole violations, turned himself in to the Boulder police two weeks ago.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you hurt or kill JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey?",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 No. No, I didn't \u2026",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 Didn't you tell your friend that you were attracted to little girls?",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 I don't think I want to answer that.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 OK. You were living in Boulder at the time JonBen\u00e9t was killed.",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 Yeah.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 Just down the street.",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 Yeah.",
      "He will admit to an obsession with JonBen\u00e9t.",
      "Gary Oliva:\u00a0 I believe that she came to me after she was killed and revealed herself to me.",
      "As it turns out, we're not the only ones interested in Oliva. A Boulder police officer showed up to take notes.",
      "Alex Hunter | Former Boulder District Attorney:\u00a0 I would be concerned if any lead was not fully taken to ground.",
      "Former Boulder district attorney, Alex Hunter, says police tried to follow up on pedophiles, but admits that early on the force was clearly overwhelmed.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Didn't your office have to tell police officers, \"You've got to look at these other leads? You can't just focus on the Ramseys.\"",
      "Alex Hunter: Well, it \u2014 it was said, probably not in quite that language, but yes.",
      "Why didn't authorities take a sex offender like Oliva more seriously? Just this week, Boulder police said Oliva is not a suspect. Sources say his DNA doesn't match evidence at the scene.",
      "John Ramsey:\u00a0 Nor does ours.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 What do you think of that?",
      "Patsy Ramsey: I think it's a double standard. Don't you?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Is it fair to say then that the state of the evidence right now, there just isn't enough to convict the Ramseys beyond a reasonable doubt?",
      "Alex Hunter:\u00a0 There isn't enough to convict anybody beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "But Hunter believes this case someday can be solved, although he doesn't think Smit is the man to do it.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you feel that Lou Smit's feelings for the Ramseys clouded his judgment?",
      "Alex Hunter: I think a little bit.",
      "Hunter believes Smit, a devout Christian, crossed a line. When working as a D.A. investigator, he prayed with the Ramseys.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you think maybe you've gotten too close to the Ramseys?",
      "Det. Smit:\u00a0 Well, let's put it this way, I don't think I did. If the Ramseys did this and I found out, I'd be the first one standing in line at the Boulder Police Department.",
      "JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey would have been 12 years old this year and in sixth grade. Instead, she's buried in a Georgia cemetery, while her brutal killer or killers go free.",
      "2024: JOHN RAMSEY STILL HAS HOPE",
      "Remarkably, not much has changed since that 2002 program. The case is at a standstill. But with the passage of so much time comes the loss of some key figures. Most notably Patsy Ramsey, who died of cancer in 2006. She was 49. John Ramsey remarried five years later.",
      "Erin Moriarty: I think back about Patsy. And I remember Patsy saying that your lives could not go on until the killer was found.",
      "John Ramsey: Well \u2014",
      "Erin Moriarty: How much weight was that on Patsy before she died?",
      "John Ramsey: Patsy was a very strong woman. She really was and a very kind person, a wonderful mother. She got pretty vilified of the media, which was horribly unfair. \u2026 I think hurt deeper than it showed.",
      "Investigator Lou Smit worked on the case almost until the day he died in August 2010. His family continues to pursue leads.",
      "Erin Moriarty: John, do you believe this case could be solved \u2026?",
      "John Ramsey: Yes, I do. If the police will take advantage of all the technology that's available to 'em and that's, uh, going to one or two of the world's cutting-edge labs for DNA testing. \u2026 And I think if they do that and if we're successful getting a sample in the right format and then do the genealogy research, I'm 80 percent confident it could be solved. \u2026 but you gotta do it.",
      "In November 2024, the Boulder Police Department released a statement which said: \"The assertion that there is viable evidence and leads we are not pursuing \u2014 to include DNA testing \u2014 is completely false.\" The department said there is an ongoing investigation, and they are looking into the recommendations made by a recent Cold Case review team.",
      "CHIEF STEPHEN REDFEARN | BOULDER POLICE DEPARTMENT: \u2026 we have thoroughly investigated multiple people identified as suspects throughout the years, and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come in to detectives.",
      "John Ramsey remains hopeful that these new efforts may finally reveal the killer \u2014 a killer he believes was already waiting in their house when the family came home from dinner that Christmas night.",
      "John Ramsey: \u2014 we were casual with our security in our home in Boulder. We thought it was a safe place \u2026 and we got casual and \u2014 and complacent.",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you look back, are there any things you wish you had done differently?",
      "John Ramsey: Well \u2026 the little beauty pageants they participated in. \u2026 I wouldn't have done that. You need to keep your children private. \u2026 it was conflict for me because Patsy just recovered from stage four ovarian cancer, was grateful to have some life ahead of her in remission. \u2026 She didn't know how long, to spend with her children and to raise her children. \u2026 I think she tried to pack a lot of mother-daughter time in that period of time that she knew she had ahead of her.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you ever dream about JonBen\u00e9t?",
      "John Ramsey: Once in a while.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Or wonder what she would've been like now?",
      "John Ramsey: Well, I dream \u2026 I occasionally have dreams and they're really wonderful dreams, but I don't try to imagine what she would've been. \u2026 She's \u2014 she was in my life for six years and was my little girl. And that's how I remember her.",

      "Scott told police Laci told him she was going to clean the house and then walk their dog, McKenzie.\u00a0 He told them that he left the house around 9:30 a.m. He said he went to a nearby warehouse where he had an office and sent an email from his computer, before setting off with his boat to the Berkeley Marina.",
      "The prosecution argued that Scott had killed Laci sometime before he left the house that morning.",
      "Janey Peterson: The state asserts that \u2013 Scott murdered Laci and that he loaded her body in his pickup, drove it to his warehouse.",
      "But if Laci was seen alive after Scott left the house, Janey says the prosecution's case falls apart.",
      "Janey Peterson: There's an abundance of evidence that shows that Laci was alive when he left for the day.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti [pointing at evidence board]:\u00a0 What does this show here?",
      "Janey Peterson: The pink squares are all the people in the neighborhood who reported seeing Laci or McKenzie that morning.",
      "Janey says most of these witnesses reported the sightings between 9:45 and 10:30 in the morning \u2013 after Scott said he left the house. She says so much depends on these witnesses, but the defense never called them to defend Scott at his trial.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: If so many people saw Laci, claim to have seen Laci after that point \u2026 Why didn't the defense bring them to the stand so that we could hear from their mouth what they saw?",
      "Janey Peterson: I think there were \u2013 multiple factors that played into it.\u00a0 \u2026 you had people who, as time went by, thought that maybe what they saw wasn't relevant to the case.",
      "Pat Harris: There's been a lot of criticism because we didn't call some witnesses who saw Laci that day.",
      "Scott Peterson's attorney Pat Harris.",
      "Pat Harris: The original thought process at the time was \u2026 a number of the witnesses who saw her didn't have great \u2013 memories or had contra \u2013 were contradicting each other.",
      "Police Detective Jon Buehler says none of the witnesses were actually sure if they did in fact see Laci.",
      "Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: There were three girls in the neighborhood, two of which were pregnant at the time \u2026 and two of them having dogs walking in the neighborhood \u2026 So, it would be real easy for somebody to mistakenly see one of those three girls as being Laci.",
      "Still, Janey Peterson says there is a witness who helps prove Laci was alive after Scott left that morning. It was the mailman.",
      "Janey Peterson: What the mailman said is that, when I went by the Peterson house the morning of December 24th, I went by there between 10:30 and 10:50. \u2026 the gate was open, and McKenzie was not on the property.",
      "Janey says that's because Laci was out walking McKenzie. If McKenzie had been home, she argues, he would have barked at the mailman \u2013 because he always did.",
      "Janey Peterson: \u2026 this dog, in particular, barked at that mailman every single day, whether he was behind the gate or in the house.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: So, what you are saying is during this time, Laci had McKenzie and they were \u2013",
      "Janey Peterson: On a walk.",
      "And according to Janey, if Laci was out walking her dog, then Scott \u2013 who was in his office sending an email \u2013 could not have killed her.\u00a0 But when it came time to testify, the mailman didn't have a clear recollection and said \"nothing out of the ordinary\" happened that day.",
      "Maybe more importantly to a new defense case though, is what Janey believes actually happened to Laci. Instead of Scott killing his pregnant wife, she says it's more likely it was those burglars who robbed the house just across the street.",
      "Janey Peterson: There's too many unanswered questions about that burglary to set it aside.",
      "The day Laci disappeared, December 24, the homeowners left to go on a trip around 10:30 in the morning.\u00a0 Scott Peterson and his team believe that Laci actually confronted the burglars and something bad happened. To prove it, they point to what they call the \"Aponte tip.\"",
      "Janey Peterson [pointing at evidence board]:\u00a0 This is the Aponte tip ... that was the call that was overheard by Lieutenant Aponte at Norco Prison.",
      "Lieutenant Xavier Aponte was a corrections officer. He called in a tip about a phone recording he had heard about a month after Laci disappeared.",
      "Janey Peterson: And he said he had an inmate who was on the phone with his brother in Modesto discussing the fact that Laci had encountered the burglars across the street from her house.",
      "Janey Peterson: When we heard this, we all thought, \"Wow, maybe \u2013 maybe this'll give us some answers as to what happened to Laci.\"",

      "Pat Harris: The police figured out who did it. \u2026 They asked the culprits, \"Well, when did you do this?\" And the two gentlemen that were arrested said, \"Oh, it was \u2013 December 26th, the day after Christmas.\"",
      "Not on December 24, when Laci went missing, but two days later.\u00a0 Peterson's defense isn't buying it.",
      "Pat Harris: On December 26th, there was a line of media \u2026 reporters standing outside the Peterson home up and down that street. There is no way in hell you could burglarize a house with all those people standing out there.",
      "But police say the burglars broke in through a back door on the 26th, out of sight of the street and any reporters who may have been there.",
      "As for the tip about an inmate phone call from prison, prosecutors say the phone call is just hearsay. Still, Peterson's attorney says if Scott gets a chance at a new trial, that burglary will be front and center. And so will their theory of the crime: that Scott Peterson was actually framed for his wife's murder.",

      "Pat Harris: I think the biggest problem I have is \u2026 what I call the \"he didn't act right\" evidence. There is no such thing as how to act. There's no playbook on how to act when your wife has been murdered. \u2026 No matter what you do, when you've built the narrative in your mind that he's guilty, whatever Scott did was gonna be interpreted through the lens of he's guilty \u2026",
      "Pat Harris: It was a terrible investigation from the first minute.",

      "But the Supreme Court said that the judge was correct not to let it in. They said the defense had used a different boat, a different motor, in different weather, and one of their own employees who stepped on the side of the boat to let in water and allow the boat to swamp. They even pointed out that the original judge offered the defense a chance to redo the experiment with the original boat and someone who was not a defense employee. But the defense declined. Still, Janey says if given a chance, the defense will present other exonerating evidence.",
      "Janey Peterson: We have an ongoing investigation that we don't discuss publicly. But I guarantee you that Scott will never be convicted of capital murder again in a court of law.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Some of the most damning evidence is where Laci and her unborn child were found. They washed up very close to an area where Scott Peterson was fishing. Are you saying that's just coincidence?",

      "As for the idea that Scott was framed \u2026",
      "Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: What is the likelihood that somebody is going to abduct Laci, and then all of a sudden, the media has intense scrutiny and attention to it. And then they're going to take her 90 miles to San Francisco Bay, and they're going to put her in the exact same area that Scott said he was fishing in? All the while we're doing searches up there, all the while that the media is camped out over there, that you've got cops and deputies and other agencies over there looking into this.",
      "Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: You want to try and make that stretch with me that somebody is going to drive from Modesto to Berkeley to take a body out there in the midst of that? Well, I guess possible. But you know, there's still people that believe the earth is flat, too.",
      "The District Attorney is not commenting on the defense's theories, but at Peterson's trial, contrary to what the defense argued, prosecutors laid out their relatively clear theory of the crime: that Laci had been murdered in the home either the night before or the morning she disappeared.

      "Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: You have to dismiss so much circumstantial evidence in this case to believe that Scott didn't do this.",
      "Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: In a circumstantial evidence case becomes like a big rope. It's got strand after stranded after strand. And when you get so many strands weaved together on this big rope, this rope is very, very strong.",
      "Buehler remains as confident as he ever was in Peterson's guilt. But Scott's defenders are just as confident.",

      "West Virginia native Rachel Braslavi says she moved into her new home so that her family could have more space, and more of a community feel. But she faces bigger questions than she might with a typical home purchase. Their community is the Israeli settlement of Karnei Shomron, located inside the occupied West Bank.",

      "This settlement, like hundreds of others, is carved into Palestinian land, surrounded by a security fence. \u00a0The border separating the West Bank from Israel is called the Green Line. It was drawn as part of an armistice agreement following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, which was sparked when the modern state of Israel was formed.",

      "But Rachel Braslavi does not see herself as living on Palestinian land: \"No. I don't. I think that some of the first places that Jews arrived to back in Biblical times were in Judea and Samaria. So, to me, this is part of our indigenous right to be here.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of your decision to move here to a settlement was cost of living versus ideology?\"",
      "\"I came from America when I was in my 20s to live in Israel,\" she said. \"And I kind of thought of that move as, like, my contribution to the Jewish people in our homeland. It didn't matter where I lived in Israel.",

      "\"Settlers make a security argument, that Israel is safer with the settlements,\" I said.",
      "\"The security argument is completely bogus,\" Sharon replied. \"The settlements are not a security asset; they are a security burden, because defending, protecting scores of civilians, deep in densely populated Palestinian territory, is one hell of a burden for the military.\"",
      "He added, \"The best way to ensure Israel's security is to have partnership with the state or state-like entity that has an interest in preventing precisely this kind of hostile activity.\"",
      "David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \"We have ideologues on both sides of this equation that are determined to thwart any accommodation.\"",

      "The negotiations changed under Donald Trump, said Makovsky: \"Until Trump, all of the U.S. peace approaches were similar. Under Trump, working with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he doesn't want to pick and choose which settlements make it and which don't. So, the prime minister convinced the president that every single settlement is called Israel. Now that creates an impossible situation of Swiss cheese. Any Palestinian entity is now going to be dotted with settlements.\"",

      "According to Makovsky, \"2005 is for the settlers their Waterloo, their defeat.\" That's when Israel removed all 8,000 settlers from Gaza.",
      "Back then, I profiled a 17-year-old who was being forced to leave Gush Katif, her settlement in Gaza.

      "Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven't publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy.",

His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,\" said the statement.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 08:59:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The suspect, identified by local media as 50-year-old Taleb A., was arrested after plowing a black BMW into a Christmas market.",
    "story": [
      "As Germany mourns the death of at least five people after a vehicle intentionally plowed into a crowded Christmas market, authorities are working to understand the suspect behind the attack.",
      "The suspect \u2013 identified by local media as 50-year-old Taleb A. \u2013 had been living and working as a psychiatry and psychotherapy specialist in Germany for two decades, authorities said.",
      "Originally from Saudi Arabia, Taleb arrived in Germany in 2006 and was recognized as a refugee in 2016, CBS News partner BBC reported. He worked at the Salus-Fachklinikum Bernburg, a specialist clinic in Bernburg, about 25 miles south of Magdeburg.",
      "In an Instagram post on Saturday, the clinic said it was \"shocked to learn that the alleged perpetrator worked as a specialist doctor in our enforcement in Bernburg.\" It added that Taleb had worked at the company since March 2020 but had not been on duty since October 2024 due to illness and holiday.",
      "\"We have been supporting the work of the investigative authorities in every possible way since the late hours,\" and they are \"stunned and shocked by the horrific attack.\"",
      "The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger M\u00fcnch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch \"appropriate investigative measures.\"",
      "\"The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,\" said M\u00fcnch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI.",
      "He said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific.",
      "The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said Saturday on X that it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year.",
      "\"This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,\" the office said. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details.",
      "Taleb's X account is filled with posts and re-shared posts focusing on anti-Islam themes and criticism of the religion while sharing congratulatory notes to Muslims who left the faith. He also described himself as a former Muslim.",
      "He was critical of German authorities, saying they had failed to do enough to combat the \"Islamism of Europe.\"",
      "He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.",
      "Germany's FAZ newspaper said it interviewed the suspect in 2019 and described him as an anti-Islam activist.",
      "\"People like me, who have an Islamic background but are no longer believers, are met with neither understanding nor tolerance by Muslims here,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I am history's most aggressive critic of Islam. If you don't believe me, ask the Arabs.\"",
      "Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann posted on X that he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile.",
      "Neumann, the terrorism expert, wrote: \"After 25 years in this 'business' you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists \u2014 that really wasn't on my radar.\"",
      "Some described Taleb as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers.",
      "On Saturday, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters: \"At this point, we can only say for sure that the perpetrator was evidently Islamophobic \u2013 we can confirm that. Everything else is a matter for further investigation and we have to wait.\"",
      "A German-based organization called Atheist Refugee Relief said the alleged attacker was not a part of the group and claimed that he made \"numerous accusations and claims\" against it and former board members, which it said were false.",
      "\"We distance ourselves from him in the strongest terms,\" the group said in a statement on its website, adding that members of Atheist Refugee Relief filed a criminal complaint against him in 2019 following \"the most foul slander and verbal attacks.\"",
      "Taleb was arrested on site after plowing a black BMW into a Christmas market crowded with holiday shoppers Friday evening in Magdeburg, killing at least five people and wounding about 200 others.",

      "Early Saturday morning, a rocket\u00a0fired from Yemen\u00a0struck an area in Tel Aviv, injuring at least 16 people. The Houthis issued a statement on Telegram saying they had aimed a hypersonic ballistic missile at a military target, which they did not identify.",
      "Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II.",

In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis did not acknowledge the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea.",
      "The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones in solidarity with the militant group Hamas since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S. and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea, or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis told Vatican bureaucrats on Saturday to stop speaking ill of one another, as he once again used his annual Christmas greetings to admonish the backstabbing and gossiping among his closest collaborators.",
      "A wheezing and congested-sounding Francis, who just turned 88, urged the prelates instead to speak well of one another and undertake a humble examination of their own consciences in the Christmas holiday season.",
      "\"A church community lives in joyful and fraternal harmony to the extent that its members walk in the life of humility, renouncing evil thinking and speaking ill of others,\" Francis said. \"Gossip is an evil that destroys social life, sickens people's hearts and leads to nothing. The people say it very well: Gossip is zero.\"",
      "\"Beware of this,\" he added.",
      "By now Francis' annual Christmas address to the priests, bishops and cardinals who work in the Vatican Curia has become a lesson in humility \u2014 and humiliation \u2014 as Francis offers a public dressing down of some of the sins in the workplace at the headquarters of the Catholic Church.",
      "In the most biting edition, in 2014, Francis listed the \"15 ailments of the Curia,\" in which he accused the prelates of using their Vatican careers to grab power and wealth. He accused them of living \"hypocritical\" double lives and forgetting \u2014 due to \"spiritual Alzheimer's\" \u2014 that they're supposed to be joyful men of God.",
      "In 2022, Francis warned them that the devil lurks among them, saying it is an \"elegant demon\" that works in people who have a rigid, holier-than-thou way of living the Catholic faith.",
      "This year, Francis revisited a theme he has often warned about: gossiping and speaking ill of people behind their backs. It was a reference to the sometimes toxic atmosphere in closed environments such as the Vatican or workplaces where office gossip and criticism circulate but are rarely aired in public.",
      "Francis has long welcomed frank and open debates and even has welcomed criticism of his own work. But he has urged critics to tell it to his face, and not behind his back.",
      "Francis opened his address Saturday with a reminder of the devastation of the war in Gaza, where he said even his patriarch had been unable to enter due to Israeli bombing.",
      "\"Yesterday children have been bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,\" he said.",
      "The annual appointment kicks off Francis' busy Christmas schedule, this year made even more strenuous because of the start of the Vatican's Holy Year on Christmas Eve. The Jubilee is expected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to Rome over 2025, and Francis has a dizzying calendar of events to minister to them.",
      "After addressing the Vatican prelates, Francis issued a less critical address to the Vatican's lay employees who gathered in the city state's main audience hall along with their families. Francis thanked them for their service and urged them to make sure they take time to play with their children and visit grandparents.",
      "\"If you have any particular problems, tell your bosses, we want to resolve them,\" he added at the end. \"You do this with dialogue, not by keeping quiet. Together we'll try to resolve the difficulties.\"",
      "It was an apparent reference to reports of growing unease within the Vatican workforce that has been called out by the Association of Vatican Lay Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union. The association has in recent months voiced alarm about the health of the Vatican pension system and fears of even more cost-cutting, and demanded the Vatican leadership listen to workers' concerns.",

      "Unlike Italy, which has robust labor laws protecting workers' rights, Vatican employees often find they have fewer legal recourses available to them when problems arise. Employment in the Vatican however is often sought-after by Italian Catholics: Aside from the sense of service to the church, Vatican employment offers tax-free benefits and access to below-market housing.",

    "title": "Biden's top hostage envoy travels to Syria to ask for help in finding Austin Tice",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 19:59:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Hostage envoy Roger Carstens traveled to Syria Friday, making the first known U.S. in-person contact with the caretaker government, and seeking help in finding missing American Austin Tice.",
    "story": [
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top official for freeing Americans held overseas, traveled to Damascus, Syria, on Friday for a high-risk mission: making the first known face-to-face contact with the caretaker government and asking for help finding missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Tice was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago during the civil war and brutal reign of now-deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. For years, U.S. officials have said they do not know with certainty whether Tice is still alive, where he is being held or by whom.",
      "Following his trip to Syria, in an exclusive interview Friday with \"Face the Nation\" from Amman, Jordan, Carstens disclosed that the U.S. Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs today conducted a \"joint search of a facility\" with\u00a0Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS \u2014 the rebel group that recently overthrew Assad's regime and is emerging as a leading power \u2014 \"that we all thought would have some sort of relation to Austin Tice.\"",
      "He did not disclose the details of the search or its outcome, only saying that HTS was \"being helpful in the search for Austin.\"",
      "\"We had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities,\" Carstens said. \"And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time.\"",
      "Carstens said he was \"stunned\" by the number of prisons the Assad regime was operating.",
      "\"I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country, and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret,\" Carstens said. \"But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating.\"",
      "The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, accompanied Carstens to Damascus as a gesture of broader outreach to HTS.",
      "Near East Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein was also with the delegation. They were the first American diplomats to visit Damascus in over a decade, according to a State Department spokesperson.",
      "They had planned to meet with HTS representatives to discuss transition principles endorsed by the U.S. and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan, the spokesperson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Aqaba last week to meet with Middle East leaders and discuss the situation in Syria.",
      "Security for the U.S. delegation was provided by DSS Mobile Security Deployments, according to a State Department official. U.S. special operations forces also provided support as they traveled by vehicle across the Jordanian border and on the road to Damascus. The convoy was given assurances by HTS that it would be granted safe passage while in Syria, but there remains a threat of attacks by other terrorist groups, including ISIS.",
      "CBS News withheld publication of this story for security concerns at the State Department's request.",
      "While finding and freeing Tice and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime is the ultimate goal, U.S. officials downplayed expectations of a breakthrough on this trip. Multiple sources told CBS News that Carstens and Leaf's intent was to convey U.S. interests to senior HTS leaders, and learn anything they can about Tice.",
      "Rubinstein will lead the U.S. diplomacy in Syria, engaging directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria, the State Department spokesperson added.",
      "Diplomatic outreach to HTS comes in a volatile, war-torn region at an uncertain moment. Two sources even compared the potential danger to the expeditionary diplomacy practiced by the late U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who led outreach to rebels in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and was killed in a terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and intelligence post.",
      "Sending high-level American diplomats to Damascus represents a significant step in reopening U.S.-Syria relations following the fall of the Assad regime less than two weeks ago. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Damascus have been suspended since 2012, shortly after the Assad regime brutally repressed an uprising that became a 14-year civil war and spawned 13 million Syrians to flee the country in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in the world.",
      "The U.S. formally designated HTS, which had ties to al Qaeda, as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Its leader, Mohammed al Jolani, was designated as a terrorist by the US in 2013 and prior to that served time in a US prison in Iraq.",
      "Since toppling Assad, HTS has publicly signaled interest in a new more moderate trajectory. Al Jolani even shed his nom de guerre and now uses his legal name, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "U.S. sanctions on HTS linked to those terrorist designations complicate outreach somewhat, but they haven't prevented American officials from making direct contact with HTS at the direction of President Biden. Blinken recently confirmed that U.S. officials were in touch with HTS representatives prior to Carstens and Leaf's visit.",
      "\"We've heard positive statements coming from Mr. Jolani, the leader of HTS,\" Blinken told Bloomberg News on Thursday. \"But what everyone is focused on is what's actually happening on the ground, what are they doing? Are they working to build a transition in Syria that brings everyone in?\"",
      "In that same interview, Blinken also seemed to dangle the possibility that the U.S. could help lift sanctions on HTS and its leader imposed by the United Nations, if HTS builds what he called an inclusive nonsectarian government and eventually holds elections. The Biden administration is not expected to lift the U.S.\u00a0 terrorist designation before the end of the president's\u00a0 term on January 20th.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder disclosed Thursday that the U.S. currently has approximately 2,000 US troops inside of Syria as part of the mission to defeat ISIS, a far higher number than the 900 troops the Biden administration had previously acknowledged. There are at least five U.S. military bases in the north and south of the country.",
      "The Biden administration is concerned that thousands of ISIS prisoners held at a camp known as al-Hol could be freed. It is currently guarded by the Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish allies of the U.S. who are wary of the newly-powerful HTS. The situation on the ground is rapidly changing since Russia and Iran withdrew military support from the Assad regime, which has reset the balance of power. Turkey, which has been a sometimes problematic U.S. ally, has been a conduit to HTS and is emerging as a power broker.",
      "A high-risk mission like this is unusual for the typically risk averse Biden administration, which has exercised consistently restrained diplomacy. Blinken approved Carstens and Leaf's trip and relevant congressional leaders were briefed on it days ago.",
      "\"I think it's important to have direct communication, it's important to speak as clearly as possible, to listen, to make sure that we understand as best we can where they're going and where they want to go,\" Blinken said Thursday.",
      "At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had not yet met with Assad, who fled to Russia when his regime fell earlier this month. Putin added that he would ask Assad about Austin Tice when they do meet.",
      "Tice, a Marine Corps veteran, worked for multiple news organizations including CBS News.",

    "summary": "Samuel Paty was killed by an Islamic extremist outside his school, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression.",
    "story": [
      "France's anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school near Paris four years ago, a horrific death that shocked the country.",
      "Paty, 47, was killed by an Islamic extremist outside his school on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police.",
      "Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November were accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place.",
      "The 540-seat courtroom was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. Heavy surveillance was in place, with more than 50 police officers guarding the proceedings.",
      "Seated in the front row was Paty's 9-year-old son, accompanied by family members. As the lead judge, Franck Zientara, delivered sentences one after the other, emotions in the room ran high.",
      "\"I am moved, and I am relieved,\" said Ga\u00eblle Paty, Samuel Paty's sister, as she addressed a crowd of reporters after the verdict. \"Hearing the word 'guilty' \u2014 that's what I needed.\"",
      "\"I spent this week listening to a lot of rewriting of what happened, and it was hard to hear, but now the judge has stated what really happened, and it feels good,\" she added, her voice breaking as tears filled her eyes.",
      "Families of the accused reacted with gasps, cries, shouts, and ironic clapping, prompting the judge to pause multiple times and call for silence.",
      "\"They lied about my brother,\" shouted one relative. Another woman, sobbing, exclaimed, \"They took my baby from me,\" before being escorted out by police officers.",
      "The seven-judge panel met or went above most of the terms requested by prosecutors, citing \"the exceptional gravity of the facts.\"",
      "Na\u00efm Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, friends of the attacker, were convicted of complicity in murder and sentenced to 16 years in prison each. Neither can be paroled for two thirds of their term, about 10 years. Boudaoud was accused of driving the attacker to the school, while Epsirkhanov helped him procure weapons.",
      "Brahim Chnina, 52, the Muslim father of the schoolgirl whose lies sparked the events leading to Paty's death, was sentenced to 13 years for association with a terrorist enterprise. Prosecutors had sought 10 years for him.",
      "Abdelhakim Sefrioui, a Muslim preacher, was given 15 years for organizing a hate campaign online against Paty.",
      "The shocking death of the 47-year-old teacher left an indelible mark on France, with several schools now named after him.",
      "The trial had begun in late November. The defendants were accused of assisting a perpetrator or organizing a hate campaign online in lead-up to the murder.",
      "At the time of the attack, there were protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists.",
      "The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty's killing reinforced the French state's commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life.",
      "Chnina's daughter, who was 13 at the time, claimed that she had been excluded from Paty's class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020.",
      "Chnina sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that \"this sick man\" needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina's daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question.",
      "Paty was teaching a class mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom.",
      "An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher's head in a post on social media. Police later fatally shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed.",
      "Chnina's daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet.",
      "Sefrioui, the preacher on trial, had presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role. He had filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a \"thug\" multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media.",
      "Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty's family.",
      "\"It's something that really shocks the family,\" lawyer Virginie Le Roy said ahead of the verdicts. \"You get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Apologies are pointless, they won't bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us,\" Le Roy said. \"We haven't had many explanations of the facts.\"",

      "Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better.",
      "For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, killed 1,200 Israelis and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on its military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours.",
      "Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent \u2014 \"relocation\" is the easier-to-swallow term \u2014 acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good.",
      "\"We told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,\" Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. \"It wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.\"",
      "Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a \"brain drain\" in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.",
      "Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia.",
      "Israel's population continues to grow toward 10 million people. But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza.",
      "Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, the bureau reported.",
      "The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story, a spokesperson said.",
      "Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning.",
      "\"Before the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war, we started to see a change,\" he said. \"They said to us, 'We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.'\"",
      "Fire says it's \"an issue of concern\" enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors to try to draw them back to Israel.",
      "Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks, the phone began ringing \u2014 with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said.",
      "Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza, where local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed, have even less choice. Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone.",
      "Aliya \u2014 the Hebrew term for used for immigration, literally the \"ascent\" of Jews into Israel - has always been part of the country's plan. But \"yerida\" \u2014 the term used for leaving the country, literally the \"descent\" of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not.",
      "A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go \u2014 or went \u2014 like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it's every Jew's obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel's survival.",
      "\"Emigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building,\" said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of \"Leaving Zion,\" a history of Israeli emigration. \"People still feel they have to justify their decision to move.\"",
      "Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red \"Handmaid's Tale\" robes that became a fixture of the the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack. This was not the life she wanted.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving. They were able to catch a free flight out on seven hours' notice.",
      "And yet, Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: \"My God, are we really doing this?\"",
      "They decided not to decide. They packed lightly. But weeks in Australia became months, and the couple decided to have the baby there. They told their families back in Israel that they were staying \"for now.\"",
      "\"We don't define it as 'forever,'\" Carmel said on Tuesday. \"But we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.\"",

    "summary": "The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "Malaysia announced on Friday it has agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared 10 years ago in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.",
      "The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
      "Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found. Malaysia's prime minister said 17 days after the plane disappeared that, based on the satellite data, his government had\u00a0concluded that the plane crashed down\u00a0in a remote corner of the Indian Ocean, and that there were no survivors.",
      "Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Malaysia had agreed to a new search operation by maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which also carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.",
      "The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.",
      "Loke said a new 5,800 square mile area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity, which is based in the United Kingdom and United States.",
      "\"The new search area proposed by Ocean Infinity is based on the latest information and data analysis conducted by experts and researchers,\" Loke said.",
      "\"The proposal for a search operation by Ocean Infinity is a solid one and deserves to be considered,\" he told reporters.",
      "The government said it agreed to Ocean Infinity's proposal \"in principle\" on December 13, with the transport ministry expected to finalize terms by early 2025.",
      "The new search will resume \"as soon as the contract is finalized and signed by both parties,\" Loke said.",
      "\"They have informed us that the ideal time for the search in the designated waters is between January and April. We are working to finalise the agreement as quickly as possible,\" he added.",
      "\"I truly hope there will be an end to the loss of MH370. May all questions be answered,\" Malaysian Rosila Abu Samah, 60, the stepmother of one of the passengers, told AFP.",
      "Malaysian Shim Kok Chau, 49, whose wife was a flight attendant on the ill-fated flight, said he had come to accept her fate but hopes to know what happened to the plane, \"why it happened and who did it.\"",
      "Among the other victims was a celebrated group of 24 Chinese calligraphy artists coming from an exhibition of their work. Two young Iranian men on the plane, 18-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad and 29-year-old Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, were traveling on stolen passports to seek better lives in Europe.",
      "Two of the U.S. citizens on the plane were young children, Nicole Meng, 4, and 2-year-old Yan Zhang.",
      "Philip Wood was the only\u00a0American adult on the flight. The IBM executive had been living in Beijing and was planning to relocate to the Malaysian capital with his girlfriend, Sarah Bajc.",
      "\"No find, no fee\"",
      "The new search will be on the same \"no find, no fee\" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if they find the aircraft.",
      "The contract is for 18 months and Malaysia will pay $70 million to the company if the plane is found, Loke said.",
      "He said the decision to agree to a fresh search \"reflects the Malaysian government's commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure to the families of the MH370 victims.\"",
      "The original Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up.",
      "In July 2015, an airplane fragment later\u00a0confirmed to be a flaperon\u00a0from MH370 was found washed ashore on the western Indian Ocean island of Reunion. It was the first hard evidence that the plane had gone down in the area. More debris was later found washed up on the coast of eastern Africa.",
      "The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories \u2014 including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.",
      "A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.",
      "Asked if he was confident the plane will be found during the new search, Loke said: \"At this point, no one can provide guarantees.",
      "\"It has been over 10 years, and it would be unfair to expect a concrete commitment. However, under the terms and conditions, any discovery must be credible. It cannot just be a few fragments; there are specific criteria outlined in the contract.\"",

      "Water is always best, but other hydrating fluids include plain coffee or tea, sparkling or flavored waters, 100% vegetable juice, and milk or milk alternatives.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that everyone 6 months and older receives COVID and flu vaccinations, with rare exceptions.",
      "5. Pack a travel health kit",
      "For those who take multiple daily medications, the doctor recommends traveling with one pill bottle and putting the various pills in it, making it less likely for any to get misplaced.",
      "\"Make sure you have more than enough,\" he advised. \"You never know when you're going to get delayed, especially around holiday travel.\"",

      "The new research, published in November in the journal Nature, points to epigenetics (genetic activity) that may play a role in regaining weight after weight loss.",
      "What is epigenetics?",
      "\"Epigenetics, which involves chemical markers that influence gene activity without altering the DNA sequence, is crucial in how cells function and respond to environmental factors,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,\u00a0told Fox News Digital.",

      "The researchers investigated what happens to fat cells, which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them. (iStock)",
      "This differs from other cells in tissues, which divide much faster \u2013 intestinal cells, for example, generally divide every other week, he added.",

      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",
      "\"Our study indicates that one reason maintaining body weight after initial weight loss is difficult is that the fat cells remember their prior obese state and likely aim to return to this state,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "\"The authors pointed out that they cannot say for certain that the epigenetic modifications directly cause people to regain their lost weight, nor pinpoint which specific epigenetic markers may be driving this effect,\" Petronella Ravenshear, board-certified nutritionist and author of \"The Human Being Diet,\" told Fox News Digital.",

    "title": "US agriculture primed to be next frontier in cybersecurity in new year, experts, lawmakers say",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 04:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Agriculture is a major economic driver in the U.S., but it is just as prone to foreign cyber threats as more widely reported areas of the U.S. economy and security state.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Armed Services Committee member Mike Rounds, R-S.D., speaks to Fox News Digital.",
      "Cybersecurity has been a major subject of discussion in recent years, with purported Chinese spy balloons floating overhead, a major Appalachian oil pipeline hacked with ransomware and questions about mysterious drones over New Jersey skies.",
      "But one overlooked area of focus in this regard is agriculture, several prominent figures have said \u2014 especially with America\u2019s ag states primed to lend their top political leaders to Washington in the new year.",
      "Dakota State University President Jose-Marie Griffiths told Fox News Digital how important the heartland has become geopolitically, with several Dakotans gaining leadership or cabinet roles in the new year \u2014 including Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., chairing the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity.",
      "\"I said quite a lot in the past and in [congressional] testimony about my concerns about agriculture and food production\u2019s critical infrastructure, which came rather late to the cybersecurity critical infrastructure table,\" Griffiths said.",
      "INFLATION, SUSTAINABILITY AND GLOBALISM ARE POTENTIAL DEATH SENTENCE TO US AG: FARMERS",
      "\"People [will] start to realize the agricultural vehicles they're using increasingly are autonomous and connecting to broadband [via] satellite \u2014 and other ways that these become vulnerable. And for people who wish to do us harm, they're exploiting vulnerabilities as much as they can.\"",
      "Residents across the heartland pay much more attention to the threats China and other rivals pose to the U.S. agriculture sector, she said.",
      "With advancements in technology, hackers can now find their way into harvesters, granaries and the nation\u2019s freight-train network, Griffiths and Rounds said separately.",
      "Whether the cash crop is Pennsylvania potatoes, Florida oranges or Dakotan wheat, all are crucial to the U.S. economy and supply chain, and all can be subject to cyberthreats, Griffiths suggested.",
      "Rounds told Fox News Digital he has studied for some time the potential vulnerabilities of the American agriculture sector when it comes to foreign actors and cybersecurity.",
      "\"It\u2019s more than just the vehicles and so forth,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of it has to do with the infrastructure that we rely on. A good example is your water systems; your electrical systems... All of those right now are connected and they all have cyber-points-of-entry.",
      "\"And so, we have been, for an extended period of time, looking at threats that could come from overseas by adversaries that would like to infiltrate not only the water supplies, but also the electrical systems\u2026 and in some cases, sewer systems.\"",
      "Rounds said he and other lawmakers have been focused on where malign actors can proverbially \"shoot the arrows at us,\" and figure out who they are and how to stop them.",
      "GREEN GOVERNANCE IS THE NEW GUISE FOR MERCANTILISM, WILL LEAD TO GLOBAL INSTABILITY: KEVIN ROBERTS",
      "He said the Chinese firm Huawei had been selling cheap hardware to rural telecom entities and could be able to infiltrate communications systems.",
      "\"Once we found out that that was in there\u2026 that they could be putting in latent materials that could be activated at a later date, we've gotten most of them pulled out. But that's just one example of the ways in which rural areas can be a way into the rest of our communication systems,\" he said.",
      "Rounds said drones are becoming increasingly used in agriculture, and they, too, have the danger of being hacked.",
      "Vehicles like harvesters and tractors have also greatly advanced technologically in the near term and face similar challenges.",
      "\"A lot of that right now is done with GPS. You get into your tractor, you plug it in and basically it'll drive it for you. We leave people in those tractors, but at some stage of the game, some of those might very well become autonomous as well \u2014 and they're subject to cyber-intervention\u2026\" he said.",
      "Grain elevators also can be interfered with, which stymies marketing and transportation, and endangers the greater supply chain and the ability for a farmer to sell on the open market, Rounds said.",
      "Asked if he preferred today\u2019s agriculture sector to the era before automation, Rounds said it\u2019s not about what he thinks, but what is going to happen in the future.",
      "\"We will have more and more autonomous vehicles being used in farming. And the reason is we don't have the manpower \u2014 and we replace it with machinery. The machinery is going to get bigger. It's going to become more sophisticated, and we're going to be expected to do more things with fewer people actually operating them.,\" he said.",
      "\"The supply chain is so critical. We rely on autonomy in many cases for a lot of the delivery of our resources, both to the farmer, but also back out from the farmer in terms of a commodity that he wants to market.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 10:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network can help ensure your information remains security and your privacy remains intact. Kurt the CyberGuy explains.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Have you ever felt a little uneasy while browsing the internet, wondering who might be watching your online activities?",
      "Well, let me introduce you to a handy tool that can put your mind at ease: the virtual private network, or VPN.",
      "Whether you're working from home, streaming your favorite shows or just exploring the web, a VPN can help ensure that your data stays secure and your privacy intact. So, let\u2019s dive into why having a VPN at home is a smart move.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "A VPN on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A virtual private network, or VPN, encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through a server in a different location than your own. VPNs make it appear that you are connecting to the internet from whichever location the server is hosted in rather than your actual location.",
      "When you first connect to a network using a VPN, your device will establish a secure connection with the VPN server, and your device's IP address will appear as the VPN server, meaning that only your internet service provider will see that you're connecting to a VPN server. Normally, when you connect to a website, the website or any online services you visit can see your device's technical information, including location-sensitive data such as IP addresses.",
      "THE BEST VPNS FOR BROWSING THE WEB IN 2024",
      "Why would you want a VPN at home?",
      "While your home internet connection is more secure than a\u00a0public Wi-Fi connection, VPNs still provide a greater sense of privacy and access to content that might be restricted due to location. Here are 10 reasons I have for getting a home VPN.",
      "Online communication can be hit or miss when it comes to security. Some messaging services, such as Whatsapp, use end-to-end device encryption, which helps keep your messages secure, but other messaging services, such as Skype, don't use end-to-end encryption. If you use a VPN with any communication apps, then all your connection and messaging data between your device and the VPN server is fully encrypted.",
      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Online content and services like Netflix are restricted to specific geographic regions. This content can range from news websites to video streaming platforms and social media apps. Using a VPN at home can appear to be using the internet from another location, allowing you to access restricted services.",
      "Sometimes, an internet service provider (ISP) will slow down bandwidth or certain online activities. One of the most common reasons networks do this is to manage network congestion, especially during peak hours. You might notice that your home internet connection slows down at night, when everyone is home from work, or it might slow down when summer vacation starts. Using a VPN will prevent your service provider from identifying the type of web content you are accessing, making it impossible for your ISP to slow down your traffic.",
      "A VPN also keeps your internet activity private from Wi-Fi network admins, who, if technically skilled enough, can figure out which websites you've visited. If you're worried about the Wi-Fi admin of your office, hotel, school or other public place having access to your browsing history, a VPN is the perfect solution for you. When it comes to your own home Wi-Fi network, a VPN will keep your browsing history private from other household members.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers deploy large-scale cyberattacks to observe network activity and steal your information. These attacks are particularly prevalent on public Wi-Fi networks, which often have minimal security measures, but they can also target secured networks. Using a VPN can significantly enhance your security by providing encryption for your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and read your data. This encryption is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi, as it secures your information from potential eavesdroppers.",
      "Additionally, a VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server, helping to protect your identity online and making it harder for attackers to target you directly. However, it is essential to understand that while a VPN adds a layer of security,\u00a0it is not a comprehensive solution against all cyber threats.",
      "A VPN does not prevent malware infections or\u00a0phishing attacks, so you must still employ\u00a0strong antivirus software and exercise caution when clicking on links or downloading files.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Furthermore, not all VPNs are created equal; some may have vulnerabilities or questionable privacy practices. It is crucial to choose a\u00a0reputable provider that uses strong encryption and has a clear no-logging policy.",
      "There's a myriad of reasons, ranging from political to economic, that countries use to justify censoring certain apps and websites. It can be incredibly frustrating for citizens and anyone traveling to that country to lose access to email, social media, news websites and other tools that keep us connected to the world around us. I've used VPNs extensively while traveling to ensure that I can always view my most important websites, no matter where I actually am. As I've mentioned, a VPN can mask your IP address and make it appear as traffic from a different country, allowing you to bypass online geographic restrictions.",
      "One of the best reasons to have a VPN at home is that it can help you save money and find better deals while online shopping. Some online retailers change their prices depending on users' locations. However, when using a VPN while shopping for plane tickets, hotels or gifts, it's possible to\u00a0find cheaper prices just by changing your location.",
      "It's no longer the work of sci-fi. We do know that governments, nearly all of them, surveil their citizens. A VPN will add a layer of privacy, making it significantly more difficult for governments to detect your web traffic. Even if you feel that you have nothing to hide, online privacy is something you should feel free to exercise.",
      "Much like governments, your ISP can surveil your online activity with ease. While most ISPs claim that they don't sell your browsing data, they are often allowed through contracts with marketing agencies to give your data away for free to advertise to you. The simplest way to hide your online activity from your ISP is to use a VPN. When using a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see which websites you visit or which apps you use.",
      "Image of a Google search on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW VPNS SHIELD YOUR IDENTITY AND SECURE YOUR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS FROM THEFT",
      "While it may seem counterintuitive, a VPN can offer faster connection speeds for online gaming. It can also help prevent your ISP from throttling bandwidth directly from gaming servers. By changing your VPN's location, you can connect to a server closer to your gaming server, which will give you better latency. This is also called ping, which determines how fast the server responds to your inputs.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "Tips for maximizing your VPN security",
      "To fully leverage the benefits of your VPN and enhance your online security, consider these important tips that will help protect your personal information and ensure safe browsing.",
      "1. Choose a reliable VPN:\u00a0Select a reputable VPN service with strong encryption protocols.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on\u00a0public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5. Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up-to-date with the latest security patches.",
      "7. Be cautious of phishing scams while using a VPN:\u00a0Even with a VPN securing your connection, phishing scams remain a significant threat to your online safety. These scams often use deceptive emails or links to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. To protect yourself, combine the use of a VPN with\u00a0strong antivirus software that detects and blocks phishing attempts. Additionally, always scrutinize unsolicited emails, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and never provide personal information without verifying the source.\u00a0For the best protection, check out my expert reviews of the top 2024 antivirus solutions for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Together with a VPN, this approach helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you want to start taking your online privacy seriously, it's worth getting a VPN. There are a wide range of options available. You can pick up a router with a VPN or install a software VPN on your devices. I prefer to have a VPN on my laptop and smartphone, and I especially find it useful when traveling internationally.",

    "story": [
      "An inventor designed rooftop solar panels for his Tesla Model Y.",
      "Have you ever wondered how we could make our cars even greener?",
      "Well, meet Omid Sadeghpour, a forward-thinking inventor with a brilliant idea. He\u2019s designed rooftop solar panels specifically for his Tesla Model Y.",
      "His project, DartSolar, harnesses solar energy while the car is parked, potentially adding up to 20 extra miles of driving range each day without ever needing to plug in. As he gets ready to roll out the next iteration, Beta2, let\u2019s explore what makes this innovation so groundbreaking.",

      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "The concept behind DartSolar",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) often spend significant time parked in open spaces, making them ideal candidates for solar energy collection. Sadeghpour's vision is simple yet effective: why not utilize the sun's energy to charge EVs while they are stationary? This concept forms the foundation of the DartSolar project.",
      "DartSolar isn\u2019t just about innovation; it\u2019s also about practicality. Imagine a rooftop solar panel that\u2019s aerodynamic, weatherproof, theft-resistant and easy to use. It opens in just 10 seconds with the same effort required to open your car door. These panels are tough, too, built to withstand wind, rain, sand and snow, ensuring reliable performance in all conditions.",
      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW FAR VOLVO'S NEW ELECTRIC SEMI-TRUCK GOES ON A SINGLE CHARGE",
      "The beta 1 prototype",
      "Omid Sadeghpour's initial prototype, known as Beta 1, was built in collaboration with Jeran Bruce at California's Forged Makerspace. This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",
      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Advancements with beta 2",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about the future. Beta 2, the fifth iteration of DartSolar, takes innovation to the next level. This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

First, it provides a viable charging solution for those venturing into remote areas where charging stations are scarce. Additionally, it acts as a backup energy source during power outages, allowing electric vehicles to remain operational even when traditional charging methods are unavailable.",
      "Although the project is currently a DIY initiative and not yet ready for commercial release, Sadeghpour plans to share blueprints and build files on the DartSolar website. This move aims to encourage others to explore similar innovations in solar technology.",

      "Scammers have become skilled at creating convincing fake websites.",
      "Online financial scams have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting unsuspecting individuals through various deceptive techniques. Cybercriminals exploit trust and create convincing scenarios to steal personal and financial information, often using well-known platforms like PayPal as their hunting ground.",
      "Take Paul from Massachusetts, for example. He recently wrote to us about his disturbing experience. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of online financial transactions. Here's his account in his own words.",
      "\"I wanted to sign up for PayPal and used Google to get the website. After the 'website' popped up, it asked me for the usual name, address, etc. and my credit card number with the expiration and 3-digit code. Almost immediately, I received a flash message from my credit card company asking if I made a purchase at a company in OKLA. I live in MA and had the card in my lap.

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Key takeaways from Paul's experience",
      "Paul's unfortunate encounter with online fraud offers several important lessons. First, scammers have become adept at creating highly convincing fake websites that can easily fool unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate platforms down to the smallest details, making it crucial to verify the authenticity of any site requesting personal information.",
      "Second, fraudulent transactions can occur with alarming speed once scammers obtain sensitive data. In Paul's case, the thieves attempted to make purchases within minutes of acquiring his credit card information.",
      "Third, credit card companies have developed sophisticated systems to detect suspicious activity rapidly, which can help mitigate potential losses. Paul's credit card company quickly alerted him to the unauthorized transaction and took swift action to prevent further fraud.",
      "Lastly, this incident underscores the critical importance of digital vigilance and careful online navigation. Always take the time to verify the authenticity of websites before entering any personal or financial information, especially when dealing with financial services or online payments.",

      "Protecting your financial information online is crucial. Here are some important steps you can take to safeguard yourself against cyber threats:",
      "Verify the website's authenticity: Before entering any personal information online, always double-check the URL of the website you're visiting. Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the address and a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates a secure connection. To ensure you're on the correct site, type the web address directly into your browser instead of relying on search engine results or clicking on links from emails.",
      "Be wary of unsolicited communications:\u00a0Legitimate companies will never send unsolicited emails asking for sensitive information. Avoid clicking on links in emails claiming to be from financial institutions, as these could be phishing attempts. Hover over the links to see the actual URL before clicking, as this can help you identify suspicious or misleading addresses. If you're unsure about a communication, log in to your account directly through the official website or app to check for any notifications or requests.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Use strong authentication methods:\u00a0Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your financial accounts to add an extra layer of security. Create unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding the temptation to reuse passwords across multiple sites. Consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely.",
      "Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Make it a habit to check your financial accounts frequently for any unauthorized activities or suspicious transactions. Set up alerts for transactions on your credit cards and online payment accounts so you can be immediately notified of any activity on your accounts.",
      "Be cautious with personal information: Never share your passwords or answers to security questions with anyone, no matter how trustworthy they may seem. Be skeptical of any requests for personal information, especially those that create a sense of urgency. Legitimate organizations will not pressure you to provide sensitive data immediately.",
      "Use secure payment methods: When making purchases from unknown sellers, use protected payment options that offer buyer protection. Consider using credit cards for online purchases, as they often provide better fraud protection than debit cards. If a website offers multiple payment options, choose the most secure method available.",
      "Use caution with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks for financial transactions, as these can be easily compromised. If you must access financial accounts while away from home, use a secure VPN connection to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\u00a0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog. Users unknowingly paste and execute a crafted PowerShell command, which silently installs the Lumma info-stealer malware onto their system.",

      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down.

Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true.

      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",

What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem.

      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "The holiday season is the best time of the year. Many of us spend quality time with our families, enjoy delicious food and even go on vacations. For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase. However, you can keep yourself safe by staying informed about potential threats, choosing apps with robust security measures and practicing good mobile hygiene.

      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "3)\u00a0Social media gift exchange scam",
      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",

      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",

      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have.

      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records.

This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",

      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg surprised some observers this week when he announced a first-degree murder charge against Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old Ivy League computer whiz accused of assassinating a health insurance executive in an ambush attack outside a New York City hotel.",
      "Under New York law, which differs in this regard from many other states, second-degree murder is the normal charge for a premeditated slaying. First-degree charges have additional requirements, such as the victim being a police officer or a murder involving torture.",

In fact, in light of the public support he has, this charge or overfiling could backfire on the prosecution.\"",
      "The terror charge \u2014 and surprise federal stalking charges \u2014 prompted pushback from Mangione's defense lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo.",
      "\"This is a highly unusual situation we find ourselves in,\" Friedman Agnifilo told a federal judge in Manhattan Thursday after the Justice Department revealed its own case against Mangione, which she described as contradictory.",
      "\"I want to note that the theory of the murder charge in the Manhattan DA case seems to be in conflict with and in opposite to the theory that is here being brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" she said in court. \"There, they talk about terrorism and potentially influencing a group of people. This is stalking an individual. That's what the theory is here. Those are two completely different theories. These seem like different cases.\"",

      "At the head of Iran\u2019s detonators program is an organization the NCRI has dubbed METFAZ, which is the Farsi acronym for the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies on Explosions and Impact, and its recent movements at a previously deactivated site, known as Sanjarian, has drawn immense speculation.",

      "Iran has at least a dozen sites across the country dedicated to nuclear development, weaponization, research and heavy water production, but information shared with Fox News Digital suggests that there has been an increase in covert activity in at least two of these locations, including Sanjarian, which was once one of Iran\u2019s top weaponization facilities.",
      "The Sanjarian site, located roughly 25 miles east of Tehran and once central to Iran\u2019s nuclear program under what is known as the Amad Plan, was believed to have been largely inactive between 2009 and late 2020 after stiff international pushback on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "METFAZ falls under Iran\u2019s Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is widely known to security experts as the organization spearheading Iran\u2019s nuclear development and is suspected of using the Sanjarian site for renewed research on exoloding bridgewire (EWB) detonators.",
      "Iran has previously attempted to conceal its EBW detonators program, a system first invented in the 1940s to deploy atomic warheads but which has expanded into non-military sectors, under activities relating to the oil industry.",
      "In a 2015 report, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), noted that Iran\u2019s detonator development was an \"integral part of a program to develop an implosion-type nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "It also highlighted how Iran attempted to conceal its program by alleging during a May 20, 2014, meeting that the detonator program dating back to 2000-2003 was related to Tehran\u2019s aerospace industry and was needed to \"help prevent explosive accidents\" but which the IAEA determined was \"inconsistent with the timeframe and unrelated to the detonator development program.\"",

      "The IAEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on the NCRI\u2019s most recent findings, which were shared with the nuclear watchdog this week, and it remains unclear what advancements or research Iran continues to pursue in the detonator field.",

Milshtein believes that the events in Syria played a role in the PA\u2019s decision to act. \"People in the West Bank say that when one dictator (PA President Mahmoud Abbas) saw what happened to the other (Bashar al-Assad), he decided he would not follow the same fate,\" Milshtein explained. \"Mahmoud Abbas likely felt that he needed to act before the PA\u2019s authority in the West Bank completely erodes.\"",
      "The operation, which is part of a larger crackdown in the northern West Bank, also reflects the PA\u2019s desire to assert itself as a capable authority ahead of potential political developments in Gaza. The PA has long struggled with its ability to govern Gaza, which it lost to Hamas in 2007. Now, with the region in turmoil, it is hoping to prove that it can restore order in the West Bank, which it argues will bolster its legitimacy in any postwar political scenario for Gaza.",

      "\"I don\u2019t see a possibility that the PA will control Gaza,\" Milshtein said, \"There are two million people there. For 17 years, they have been ruled by Hamas, and 60% were born after Hamas took control. They were educated to view the PA as collaborators with Israel and enemies. Giving the PA two hours in Gaza is a known failure from the outset.\"",
      "Despite the violence in Jenin, Daraghmeh does not foresee the conflict spreading beyond. \"People in Ramallah, Hebron and other cities don\u2019t want the West Bank to turn into another Gaza,\" Daraghmeh said. \"The situation in Jenin is contained, but it remains a test for the PA\u2019s ability to control its own territory.\"",

      "According to a report titled, \"The Near Enemy: China\u2019s Subnational Reach Into the United States\" and released on Tuesday by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), China\u2019s localized subnational relations in the U.S. are its driving force behind Beijing's continued influence in a range of sectors nationwide.",

It also dwarfs the leverage cultivated by the \u2018active measures\u2019 playbook deployed by the last U.S. great power rival, the Soviet Union,\" the authors of the report found.",
      "This sphere of influence is obtained by skirting federal policies and instead focusing on relation-building at the state and local levels, whether this is through private contracts, state-based programs, or acquisitions and investments that create jobs and boost local economies.",
      "\"State and local governments are more \u2018pragmatic\u2019 than their federal counterparts, focused on \u2018employment and economic development\u2019 rather than security concerns,\" the authors said in reference to a 2019 report by the state-owned news agency Xinhua that reviewed local U.S. government relationships with China despite the ongoing trade war ignited one year earlier under the then-Trump administration.",

Ramaswamy describes learning about his high-caste Brahmin roots in his 2021 book \u201cWoke Inc.\u201d \u201cKings were below us,\u201d he wrote, also mentioning how his family\u2019s servants of a lower caste were required to enter the home through a different door and follow a different set of rules.",
      "\u201cCaste privilege is part of who they are,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cSome of that does open up the possibilities of adopting a deeply, deeply conservative and hierarchical way of thinking about the world.\u201d",
      "While Mishra says he doesn\u2019t think Trump overtly considered race and caste when selecting his staff, he thinks those attributes could contribute to their personas as \u201cmodel minorities\u201d and their families\u2019 immigrant success stories in the U.S.",
      "Also convenient for rising Indian Americans in the GOP is Trump\u2019s icy relationship with China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a less crowded field in terms of talented people of color in the Republican Party,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult for Chinese Americans to serve in prominent positions now than a decade ago or two decades ago because of increased tensions between the U.S. and China.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, Trump\u2019s perception of India and its Prime Minister Narendra Modi is strong.",
      "The role India might play",
      "Some experts credit some of the Indian American, and in particular Hindu, success in the Trump administration to the president-elect\u2019s affection for Modi and his government \u2014 a right-wing nationalist movement that some human rights groups blame for the rolling back of civil rights in India.",
      "Trump has put his close relationship with Modi on display on several occasions, joining hands with him at \u201cHowdy, Modi!,\u201d a rally in Houston that drew tens of thousands of Indian Americans in 2019.",
      "While none of Trump\u2019s Indian American staff picks have spoken much about India\u2019s government, both Patel and Ramaswamy have been vocal in their support for Modi\u2019s actions in the past.",
      "Another Hindu Cabinet nominee, Tulsi Gabbard, has met with the controversial prime minister multiple times and championed him in the U.S. Gabbard, who is Samoan American and converted to Hinduism in childhood, could be Modi\u2019s fiercest ally in the administration.",
      "In a video message welcoming Modi to the U.S. in 2019, Gabbard described India as one of the United States\u2019 \u201cmost important partners.\u201d She has also parroted Hindu nationalist talking points about \u201cHinduphobia\u201d growing in the U.S. and protecting Hindus from jihadist Muslims, something that Trump, too, has capitalized on.",
      "\u201cThe Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,\u201d Trump said in a 2016 Diwali campaign message organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition. \u201cWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Gabbard\u2019s team said backlash against her for her connection with Modi is \u201cbigoted.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe repeated attacks that Lt Col. Tulsi Gabbard has sustained from the media and Democrats about her faith and loyalty to our country are not only false they are bigoted as well,\u201d transition team spokesperson Alexa Henning said in an email. \u201cJust like President Trump she also recognizes the importance of U.S. \u2014 India relations and working closely together to strengthen ties especially among common interests like combatting terrorism and strengthening economic ties.\u201d",
      "While Trump isn\u2019t necessarily assessing Indian American nominees based on their relationships with India, Mishra said, the partnership creates fertile ground for more Indian and Hindu politicians to come up in the GOP.",
      "\u201cThey may or may not be aligned to Hindu right-wing politics, but larger right-wing politics is what brings them together,\u201d he said.",
      "Alignment with a movement that has been racist against Indian Americans",
      "Not everyone is on board with the Trump administration\u2019s perceived inclusion of Indian Americans, no matter how much their policy visions align.",
      "\u201cThere is definitely an element of the right which is deeply racist and white supremacist,\u201d Mishra said.",
      "Far-right and white nationalist Trump supporters have lashed out at the number of brown faces in Trump\u2019s orbit, posting on platforms like X that they think this is a signal of softness on immigration.",
      "\u201cJD Vance\u2019s wife \u2018Usha\u2019 was not raised Christian and is not a Christian,\u201d posted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist influencer whom Trump once hosted for dinner. \u201cWhat kind of family is this?\u201d",
      "\u201cDo we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and names their kid Vivek is gonna support white identity?\u201d Fuentes said in another video.",
      "Similar far-right accounts echoed that sentiment, with one posting photos of Patel, Ramaswamy and Usha Vance\u2019s family captioned \u201cthe future of \u2018conservatism.\u2019\u201d",
      "In July, when Dhillon delivered a Sikh prayer at the Republican National Convention, she was the subject of similar trolling, with big right-wing accounts accusing her of \u201cwitchcraft\u201d and calling for her deportation.",
      "Dhillon\u2019s team declined to comment.",
      "Vance and Ramaswamy have both openly spoken about being Hindu, but it often comes with a caveat. Vance said in a Fox News interview with her husband that despite her faith, she pushed him to get closer to Christianity.",
      "Ramaswamy has tried to hedge his Hindu faith by quoting Bible verses on the campaign trail and telling voters, \u201cWe share the same values, the same Judeo-Christian values in power.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment but in August told NBC News that they disagreed with that characterization.",
      "\u201cYes, he knows the Bible better than many self-proclaimed Christians, but that\u2019s exactly what allows him to speak with authority about shared values,\u201d his senior adviser and communications director Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News. \u201cHe has given speeches where he invokes a fundamental teaching from Hindu scripture, the Vedas: \u2018satyam vara, dharmam chara.\u2019 It means: speak truth, do your duty. Which happens to be the heart of Vivek\u2019s message to our country.\u201d",
      "But experts said that to a right-wing base that loves Trump for his anti-immigrant stances and \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric, no amount of assimilative behavior will win everyone over.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m old enough to vividly remember post 9/11, many Muslims, many Hindus, many Sikhs from South Asian communities went into overdrive to prove that \u2018we are truly Americans,\u2019\u201d said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. \u201cWe know today that does not work.\u201d",
      "While speaking with Vivek Ramaswamy on his podcast earlier this year, conservative pundit Ann Coulter started by telling him, \u201cI agreed with many, many things you said \u2026 when you were running for president. But I still would not have voted for you because you\u2019re an Indian.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are wrestling with a decision to fast-track legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in national elections after far-right leader Nigel Farage suggested that Elon Musk could donate to his once-fringe right-wing party, in the latest turn for the world\u2019s richest man as he flexes his newfound political muscle.",
      "What began as a tech mogul railing against political correctness in the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments on both sides of the Atlantic to reckon with Musk\u2019s growing political and cultural influence.",
      "Last week, Farage told the BBC that his Reform UK party was in \u201congoing negotiations\u201d with Musk after the pair met at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Musk, a South Africa-born U.S. citizen, is prohibited from making a personal donation to a British political party, but he could potentially contribute through the U.K. subsidiaries of his various companies, which reportedly made around \u00a390 million in profits over the past two years.",
      "\u201cHe wants to help us. He\u2019s not opposed to the idea of giving us money, provided we can do it legally through U.K. companies,\u201d Farage said.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Electoral Commission has said Prime Minister Keir Starmer must strengthen rules around political donations to protect its elections from foreign interference, according to the U.K.\u2019s Guardian newspaper.",
      "Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies.",
      "While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire\u2019s words carry weight well beyond the tech world.",
      "Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d and championing anti-immigration rhetoric.",
      "His transformation aligns with the resurgence of President-elect Donald Trump and the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France\u2019s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders.",
      "His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire\u2019s politics.",
      "Musk\u2019s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d amplified calls for a general election just months after Starmer became prime minister, and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist.",
      "Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe, Musk last week openly endorsed Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "The AfD\u2019s leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully\u00a0employing Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings.",
      "Musk\u2019s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany\u2019s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD.",
      "In September, Musk praised Italy\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a black-tie event in New York, calling her a \u201cprecious genius\u201d and \u201ceven more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, behind the scenes,\u00a0he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications.",
      "Musk met directly with Xi at a 2023 dinner in San Francisco. His Tesla electric vehicles are largely\u00a0manufactured in China, including at its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d",
      "And in the U.S., Musk has already shown signs of his power over the political process, pushing the country\u2019s government to the brink of a shutdown after joining with Trump to effectively kill a congressional spending bill.",
      "While Musk\u2019s outsize role showed what he can achieve in Washington, his capacity to wield political influence may begin to stretch beyond U.S. borders."

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 04:19:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
    "story": [
      "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end daylight saving time, a surprising pledge that, if carried through, would dramatically alter U.S. life in spring and summer months, when Americans revel in sunshine well into traditional nighttime hours.",
      "Daylight saving time tends to push sunshine to later hours, making for gloriously long, bright days in spring and summer months. Standard time brings more sunshine to earlier hours, insuring that children are not trudging to school in cold-weather darkness.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposed sunset of daylight saving time, a practice long believed to be supported by U.S. business interests, stunned the medical community that\u2019s been pushing for years to make standard time full time. Opponents of daylight saving say it can pose a risk of  mood disorders, adverse cardiovascular events and car crashes.",
      "University of California San Francisco neurologist and sleep expert Dr. Kin Yuen said she and her peer group of standard time backers still are not entirely confident in Trump\u2019s pledge even though the president-elect's Truth Social post clearly spelled out his desire to end daylight saving time.",
      "\"I think we were all rather incredulous,\" Yuen told NBC News this week, days after Trump's post. \"So yeah, we're elated. We're catching this wave that'll hopefully get more attention and point out the health benefits of adopting permanent standard time.\"",
      "The manner in which Americans adjust their clocks twice a year is outlined in the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which set parameters for daylight saving time.",
      "America most recently fell back into standard time on Nov. 7 this year.",
      "During standard time in fall and winter months, Americans enjoy about 9 to 11 hours of sunshine a day, generally starting between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.",
      "The nation springs forward to daylight saving next on March 9, 2025, ushering in spring and summer with 11 to 15 hours of daily sunshine that can often start between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.",
      "\"There is a momentum to not have to change the clocks anymore,\" said Dr. Nathaniel Watson, a long-time advocate of permanent standard time and neurologist at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center.",
      "\"But there's this conflation of, 'Let's not change clocks and the only way to do that is go to permanent daylight savings time,' which is just not the case. It should just be standard time.\"",
      "If America were to stay with standard time year-round, then sunshine during warm-weather months would hit bedroom curtains at unaccustomed early hours, perhaps between 4:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.",
      "And on the back end of summer days, the sun would set at earlier hours under standard time.",
      "During summer months, baseball games that start at 7 p.m. can often absorb several innings of sunshine and twilight under daylight saving time. But those same summer-night games, if played in standard time, might only yield an inning or two of fading sunshine before stadium lights take full effect.",
      "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine formally endorsed year-round standard time in 2020 and the American Academy of Neurology\u00a0joined on to that position in 2023.",
      "The human body functions well for 16 waking hours a day with activities best planned around \"solar noon\" \u2014 when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, doctors backing universal standard time have said.",
      "For most of standard time months, solar noon comes close to 12 p.m. on the wall clock. But during daylight saving months, that midpoint usually comes after 1 p.m.",
      "And employees and students who have a 9-to-5 schedule will now get up an hour earlier than their bodies would want to in relation to solar noon.",
      "\"So you are forcing your body to get up at a time much earlier. You're basically tricking your body into saying, 'Get up an hour earlier for work and school,' which is why a lot of people hate mornings,\" said Dr. Karin Johnson, a neurologist and sleep expert at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts.",
      "\"So if you were on daylight savings time [year-round], it would  makes us hate those mornings even more.\"",
      "For anyone concerned about the sun peeking through window shades just a few hours after stumbling home from their local bar, Johnson said that inconvenience is a small price to pay to be in better sync with circadian rhythm.",
      "\"Do we need 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. sunrises? No, none of us would like that,\" she said. \"But you can put your face down and sleep through that. What we do need is for the sun to be in alignment with our bodies [under standard time].\"",
      "Trump's announcement was also surprising because it appears to conflict with popular sentiment and leaders of his own party.",
      "The Senate two years ago overwhelmingly passed legislation to make daylight saving year-round, though the bill stalled out from there.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump's pick to lead the State Department, was one of the bill's sponsors and has been a vocal supporter of daylight saving time.",
      "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHF), which is funded by insurance companies,\u00a0has long advocated for year-round daylight saving time.",
      "The group has said lives are saved when there's better visibility in after-work and early-evening driving hours.",
      "\"We know there\u2019s a strong relationship between increased darkness and fatal crashes, especially when it comes to pedestrian and bicyclists,\" IIHF spokesperson  Joseph Young said in a statement this week.",
      "\"Leaving daylight saving time behind would result in earlier sunsets during the summer months, which would very likely result in more fatalities involving these road users.\"",
      "Should America ever flip the switch to turn off daylight saving time,  widespread infrastructure upgrades would be necessary, according to the IIHF.",
      "\"If we do see daylight saving time come to an end, communities will need to think even harder about how to improve safety for those on foot,\" Young said. \"Better lighting and infrastructure, lower vehicle speeds, and other changes that are already badly needed will become even more crucial.\"",
      "Some business interests have also advocated for daylight saving time, believing it could lead to more after-work commerce if it's not too dark.",
      "A representative for Rubio could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday, and a spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said her group has no formal position on daylight saving time.",
      "What little polling on daylight saving versus standard time has been conducted over the years seems to slightly favor daylight saving.",
      "YouGov posed the question in March 2023 and 50% of respondents said they would support permanent daylight saving time, while only 31% said they'd want year-round standard time.",
      "\"The marketing department of daylight savings time, which of course is highly connected with industries, did a much better job than we have,\" said Yuen, of UCSF.",
      "\"We naturally have more sunlight [in daylight saving months]. Whether we had daylight saving time or not, we just have longer days. And I think that we need to do a better marketing job the other way around and remind people of sitting in the dark at school in winter.\"",
      "The U.S. briefly adopted year-round\u00a0daylight saving in 1974-75, in hopes of pushing more daylight into later hours and cutting energy use during the OPEC oil embargo. But using daylight saving time in winter was wildly unpopular, with children hiking to school in darkness, and it was quickly ended.",
      "Johnson said she\u2019s convinced poll respondents who oppose permanent standard time are conflating daylight saving with the good times of spring break and summer vacations \u2014 and forgetting about the rejection of year-round daylight saving time in 1974.",
      "\"There are huge (emotional) connections between summer and daylight savings time,\" Johnson said. \"And yes, we like it when it's warm and the days are longer. But we've tried permanent daylight savings before, the last in 1974, and it didn't work.\"",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., invoked the bad memories of 1974 and said he\u2019d be willing to help Trump push for year-round standard time.",
      "\"Congress once made Daylight Saving Time permanent. It was so unpopular that Congress repealed it less than a year later,\" he said in a statement. \"The only sensible and durable way to stop the biannual time change is to make Standard Time permanent.\"",
      "The biggest response in that 2003 YouGov poll appeared to come from people who don't want to change their clocks in either direction, as 62% respondents said they simply wanted the elimination of either standard or daylight saving time, while 31% said they were OK with the status quo of both."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "The bird flu outbreak took several concerning turns this year, with the number of human cases up to at least 64.Experts outlined several indicators that the virus\u2019 spread is going in the wrong direction.Among them are recent detections of the virus in wastewater and signs of dangerous mutations.",
      "The bird flu outbreak took several concerning turns this year, with the number of human cases up to at least 64.",
      "Experts outlined several indicators that the virus\u2019 spread is going in the wrong direction.",
      "Among them are recent detections of the virus in wastewater and signs of dangerous mutations.",
      "The simmering threat of bird flu may be inching closer to boiling over.",
      "This year has been marked by a series of concerning developments in the virus\u2019 spread. Since April, at least 64 people have tested positive for the virus \u2014 the first U.S. cases other than a single infection in 2022. Dairy cow herds in 16 states have been infected this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the country\u2019s first severe bird flu infection on Wednesday, a critically ill patient in Louisiana. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency this week in response to rampant outbreaks in cows and poultry.",
      "\u201cThe traffic light is changing from green to amber,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases. \u201cSo many signs are going in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "No bird flu transmission between humans has been documented, and the CDC maintains that the immediate risk to public health is low. But scientists are increasingly worried, based on four key signals.",
      "For one, the bird flu virus \u2014 known as H5N1 \u2014 has spread uncontrolled in animals, including cows frequently in contact with people. Additionally, detections in wastewater show the virus is leaving a wide-ranging imprint, and not just in farm animals.",
      "Then there are several cases in humans where no source of infection has been identified, as well as research about the pathogen\u2019s evolution, which has shown that the virus is evolving to better fit human receptors and that it will take fewer mutations to spread among people.",
      "Together, experts say, these indicators suggest the virus has taken steps toward becoming the next pandemic.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very precarious situation right now,\u201d said Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Widespread circulation creates new pathways to people",
      "Since this avian flu outbreak began in 2022, the virus has become widespread in wild birds, commercial poultry and wild mammals like sea lions, foxes and black bears. More than 125 million poultry birds have died of infections or been culled in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "An unwelcome surprise arrived in March, when dairy cows began to fall ill, eat less feed and produce discolored milk.",
      "Research showed the virus was spreading rapidly and efficiently between cows, likely through raw milk, since infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands. Raccoons and farm cats appeared to get sick by drinking raw milk, too.",
      "The more animals get infected, the higher the chances of exposure for the humans who interact with them.",
      "\u201cThe more people infected, the more possibility mutations could occur,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and the director of the Brown University School of Public Health\u2019s Pandemic Center. \u201cI don\u2019t like giving the virus a runway to a pandemic.\u201d",
      "Until this year, cows hadn\u2019t been a focus of influenza prevention efforts.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t think dairy cattle were a host for flu, at least a meaningful host,\u201d Andrew Bowman, a professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University, told NBC News this summer.",
      "But now, the virus has been detected in at least 865 herds of cows across at least 16 states, as well as in raw (unpasteurized) milk sold in California and in domestic cats who drank raw milk.",
      "\u201cThe ways in which a community and consumers are directly at risk now is in raw milk and cheese products,\u201d Chin-Hong said. \u201cA year ago, or even a few months ago, that risk was lower.\u201d",
      "Cases with no known source of exposure",
      "The majority of the human H5N1 infections have been among poultry and dairy farmworkers. But in several puzzling cases, no source of infection has been identified.",
      "The first was a hospitalized patient in Missouri who tested positive in August and recovered. Another was a California child whose infection was reported in November.",
      "Additionally, Delaware health officials reported a case of H5N1 this week in a person without known exposure to poultry or cattle. But CDC testing could not confirm the virus was bird flu, so the agency considers it a \u201cprobable\u201d case.",
      "In Canada, a British Columbia teenager was hospitalized in early November after contracting H5N1 without any known exposure to farm or wild animals. The virus\u2019 genetic material suggested it was similar to a strain circulating in waterfowl and poultry.",
      "Such unexplained cases are giving some experts pause.",
      "\u201cThat suggests this virus may be far more out there and more people might be exposed to it than we previously thought,\u201d Nuzzo said.",
      "Rising levels of bird flu in wastewater",
      "To better understand the geography of bird flu\u2019s spread, scientists are monitoring wastewater for fragments of the virus.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen detections in a lot more places, and we\u2019ve seen a lot more frequent detections\u201d in recent months, said Amy Lockwood, the public health partnerships lead at Verily, a company that provides wastewater testing services to the CDC and a program called WastewaterSCAN.",
      "Earlier this month, about 19% of the sites in the CDC\u2019s National Wastewater Surveillance System \u2014 across at least 10 states \u2014 reported positive detections.",
      "It\u2019s not possible to know if the virus fragments found came from animal or human sources. Some could have come from wild bird excrement that enters storm drains, for example.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think any of this is an indication of human-to-human transmission now, but there is a lot of H5 virus out there,\u201d said Peggy Honein, the director of the Division of Infectious Disease Readiness & Innovation at the CDC.",
      "Lockwood and Honein said the wastewater detections have mostly been in places where dairy is processed or near poultry operations, but in recent months, mysterious hot spots have popped up in areas without such agricultural facilities.",
      "\u201cWe are starting to see it in more and more places where we don\u2019t know what the source might be automatically,\u201d Lockwood said, adding: \u201cWe are in the throes of a very big numbers game.\u201d",
      "One mutation away?",
      "Until recently, scientists who study viral evolution thought H5N1 would need a handful of mutations to spread readily between humans.",
      "But research published in the journal Science this month found that the version of the virus circulating in cows could bind to human receptors after a single mutation. (The researchers were only studying proteins in the virus, not the full, infectious virus.)",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to assume that because of this finding that a pandemic is likely to happen. We only want to make the point that the risk is increased as a result of this,\u201d said paper co-author Jim Paulson, the chair of molecular medicine at Scripps Research.",
      "Separately, scientists in recent months have identified concerning elements in another version of the virus, which was found in the Canadian teenager who got seriously ill. Virus samples showed evidence of mutations that could make it more amenable to spreading between people, Hensley said.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said it\u2019s unlikely the virus had those mutations when the teen was exposed.",
      "\u201cIt is most likely that the mixture of changes in this virus occurred after prolonged infection of the patient,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The agency\u2019s investigations do not suggest that \u201cthe virus is adapting to readily transmit between humans,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "The viral strain in the United States\u2019 first severe bird flu case, announced on Wednesday, was from the same lineage as the Canadian teen\u2019s infection.",
      "Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the CDC is assessing a sample from that patient to determine if it has any concerning mutations.",
      "Hensley, meanwhile, said he\u2019s concerned that flu season could offer the virus a shortcut to evolution. If someone gets co-infected with a seasonal flu virus and bird flu, the two can exchange chunks of genetic code.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need for mutation \u2014 the genes just swap,\u201d Hensley said, adding that he hopes farmworkers get flu shots to limit such opportunities.",
      "Future testing and vaccines",
      "Experts said plenty can be done to better track bird flu\u2019s spread and prepare for a potential pandemic. Some of that work has already begun.",
      "The USDA on Tuesday expanded bulk testing of milk to a total of 13 states, representing about 50% of the nation\u2019s supply.",
      "Nuzzo said that effort can\u2019t ramp up soon enough.",
      "\u201cWe have taken way too long to implement widespread bulk milk testing. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re finding most outbreaks on farms,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time, Andrew Trister, chief medical and scientific officer at Verily, said the company is working to improve its wastewater analysis in the hope of identifying concerning mutations.",
      "The USDA has also authorized field trials to vaccinate cows against H5N1. Hensley said his laboratory has tested a new mRNA vaccine in calves.",
      "For humans, the federal government has two bird flu vaccines stockpiled, though they would need Food and Drug Administration authorization.",
      "Nuzzo said health officials should offer the vaccines to farmworkers.",
      "\u201cWe should not wait for farmworkers to die before we act,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, scientists are developing new mRNA vaccines against H5N1. This type of vaccine, which was first used against Covid-19, can be more quickly tailored to particular viral strains and also scaled more quickly.",
      "Hensley\u2019s lab in May reported that one mRNA vaccine candidate offered protection against the virus to ferrets during preclinical testing. Another candidate under development by the CDC and Moderna has also showed promising results in ferrets, which are often used as a model for humans to study influenza.",
      "\u201cNow we just have to go through the clinical trials,\u201d Hensley said."

    "title": "Trump's plan to end daylight saving: Will 4:30 a.m. be the new American daybreak?",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 04:19:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
    "story": [
      "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end daylight saving time, a surprising pledge that, if carried through, would dramatically alter U.S. life in spring and summer months, when Americans revel in sunshine well into traditional nighttime hours.",
      "Daylight saving time tends to push sunshine to later hours, making for gloriously long, bright days in spring and summer months. Standard time brings more sunshine to earlier hours, insuring that children are not trudging to school in cold-weather darkness.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposed sunset of daylight saving time, a practice long believed to be supported by U.S. business interests, stunned the medical community that\u2019s been pushing for years to make standard time full time. Opponents of daylight saving say it can pose a risk of  mood disorders, adverse cardiovascular events and car crashes.",
      "University of California San Francisco neurologist and sleep expert Dr. Kin Yuen said she and her peer group of standard time backers still are not entirely confident in Trump\u2019s pledge even though the president-elect's Truth Social post clearly spelled out his desire to end daylight saving time.",
      "\"I think we were all rather incredulous,\" Yuen told NBC News this week, days after Trump's post. \"So yeah, we're elated. We're catching this wave that'll hopefully get more attention and point out the health benefits of adopting permanent standard time.\"",
      "The manner in which Americans adjust their clocks twice a year is outlined in the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which set parameters for daylight saving time.",
      "America most recently fell back into standard time on Nov. 7 this year.",
      "During standard time in fall and winter months, Americans enjoy about 9 to 11 hours of sunshine a day, generally starting between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.",
      "The nation springs forward to daylight saving next on March 9, 2025, ushering in spring and summer with 11 to 15 hours of daily sunshine that can often start between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.",
      "\"There is a momentum to not have to change the clocks anymore,\" said Dr. Nathaniel Watson, a long-time advocate of permanent standard time and neurologist at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center.",
      "\"But there's this conflation of, 'Let's not change clocks and the only way to do that is go to permanent daylight savings time,' which is just not the case. It should just be standard time.\"",
      "If America were to stay with standard time year-round, then sunshine during warm-weather months would hit bedroom curtains at unaccustomed early hours, perhaps between 4:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.",
      "And on the back end of summer days, the sun would set at earlier hours under standard time.",
      "During summer months, baseball games that start at 7 p.m. can often absorb several innings of sunshine and twilight under daylight saving time. But those same summer-night games, if played in standard time, might only yield an inning or two of fading sunshine before stadium lights take full effect.",
      "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine formally endorsed year-round standard time in 2020 and the American Academy of Neurology\u00a0joined on to that position in 2023.",
      "The human body functions well for 16 waking hours a day with activities best planned around \"solar noon\" \u2014 when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, doctors backing universal standard time have said.",
      "For most of standard time months, solar noon comes close to 12 p.m. on the wall clock. But during daylight saving months, that midpoint usually comes after 1 p.m.",
      "And employees and students who have a 9-to-5 schedule will now get up an hour earlier than their bodies would want to in relation to solar noon.",
      "\"So you are forcing your body to get up at a time much earlier. You're basically tricking your body into saying, 'Get up an hour earlier for work and school,' which is why a lot of people hate mornings,\" said Dr. Karin Johnson, a neurologist and sleep expert at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts.",
      "\"So if you were on daylight savings time [year-round], it would  makes us hate those mornings even more.\"",
      "For anyone concerned about the sun peeking through window shades just a few hours after stumbling home from their local bar, Johnson said that inconvenience is a small price to pay to be in better sync with circadian rhythm.",
      "\"Do we need 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. sunrises? No, none of us would like that,\" she said. \"But you can put your face down and sleep through that. What we do need is for the sun to be in alignment with our bodies [under standard time].\"",
      "Trump's announcement was also surprising because it appears to conflict with popular sentiment and leaders of his own party.",
      "The Senate two years ago overwhelmingly passed legislation to make daylight saving year-round, though the bill stalled out from there.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump's pick to lead the State Department, was one of the bill's sponsors and has been a vocal supporter of daylight saving time.",
      "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHF), which is funded by insurance companies,\u00a0has long advocated for year-round daylight saving time.",
      "The group has said lives are saved when there's better visibility in after-work and early-evening driving hours.",
      "\"We know there\u2019s a strong relationship between increased darkness and fatal crashes, especially when it comes to pedestrian and bicyclists,\" IIHF spokesperson  Joseph Young said in a statement this week.",
      "\"Leaving daylight saving time behind would result in earlier sunsets during the summer months, which would very likely result in more fatalities involving these road users.\"",
      "Should America ever flip the switch to turn off daylight saving time,  widespread infrastructure upgrades would be necessary, according to the IIHF.",
      "\"If we do see daylight saving time come to an end, communities will need to think even harder about how to improve safety for those on foot,\" Young said. \"Better lighting and infrastructure, lower vehicle speeds, and other changes that are already badly needed will become even more crucial.\"",
      "Some business interests have also advocated for daylight saving time, believing it could lead to more after-work commerce if it's not too dark.",
      "A representative for Rubio could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday, and a spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said her group has no formal position on daylight saving time.",
      "What little polling on daylight saving versus standard time has been conducted over the years seems to slightly favor daylight saving.",
      "YouGov posed the question in March 2023 and 50% of respondents said they would support permanent daylight saving time, while only 31% said they'd want year-round standard time.",
      "\"The marketing department of daylight savings time, which of course is highly connected with industries, did a much better job than we have,\" said Yuen, of UCSF.",
      "\"We naturally have more sunlight [in daylight saving months]. Whether we had daylight saving time or not, we just have longer days. And I think that we need to do a better marketing job the other way around and remind people of sitting in the dark at school in winter.\"",
      "The U.S. briefly adopted year-round\u00a0daylight saving in 1974-75, in hopes of pushing more daylight into later hours and cutting energy use during the OPEC oil embargo. But using daylight saving time in winter was wildly unpopular, with children hiking to school in darkness, and it was quickly ended.",
      "Johnson said she\u2019s convinced poll respondents who oppose permanent standard time are conflating daylight saving with the good times of spring break and summer vacations \u2014 and forgetting about the rejection of year-round daylight saving time in 1974.",
      "\"There are huge (emotional) connections between summer and daylight savings time,\" Johnson said. \"And yes, we like it when it's warm and the days are longer. But we've tried permanent daylight savings before, the last in 1974, and it didn't work.\"",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., invoked the bad memories of 1974 and said he\u2019d be willing to help Trump push for year-round standard time.",
      "\"Congress once made Daylight Saving Time permanent. It was so unpopular that Congress repealed it less than a year later,\" he said in a statement. \"The only sensible and durable way to stop the biannual time change is to make Standard Time permanent.\"",
      "The biggest response in that 2003 YouGov poll appeared to come from people who don't want to change their clocks in either direction, as 62% respondents said they simply wanted the elimination of either standard or daylight saving time, while 31% said they were OK with the status quo of both."

    "story": [
      "There was once a time that Amanda Maze, a home health nurse and mother from Kentucky, took out loans to pay for her family\u2019s Christmas presents \u2014 a decision she said caused a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of year-round payments and debt.",
      "Now, she\u2019s teaching her half-million TikTok followers that the holidays really can be priceless, or at least closer to it. Through sharing her own experience thrifting festive decor and budgeting gifts for her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s five children, Maze offers an alternative to an otherwise spend-heavy holiday season.",
      "\u201cI think my goal is just to help people understand that things in life are only temporary,\u201d Maze said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live such a materialistic lifestyle.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s among a handful of TikTok creators who have ramped up content related to budgeting around the holidays in the hopes of easing the stress of those who struggle around this time.",
      "Holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah are often synonymous with elaborate meals, aesthetic decor and over-the-top gifts. Though Americans are projected to spend over $17 billion more than last year on gifts alone, more than half of the people surveyed by NerdWallet\u2019s annual holiday spending report said holiday spending \u201cstress[es] them out.\u201d The study also found that roughly 1 in 10 people may prioritize buying gifts over paying their bills.",
      "\u201cPeople are feeling the pressure to spend on gifts, sometimes to the point of harming their ability to meet their other financial obligations,\u201d said Sara Rathner, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet.",
      "People are feeling the pressure to spend on gifts, sometimes to the point of harming their ability to meet their other financial obligations.",
      "-Sara Rathner, personal finance expert at NerdWallet.",
      "The uptick in budget-conscious holiday videos comes amid a rise in \u201cunderconsumption core,\u201d a TikTok phenomenon that encourages people to reject the microtrends and focus on the things that they actually use and enjoy on a daily basis. Many people on the platform are also already posting videos about their intentions to take part in a \u201cno spend challenge\u201d in 2025.",
      "\u201cEver since the underconsumption trend started, I feel like people are tired of [having] influencers throwing things in their face, and more normal people like me have started to become more popular,\u201d said Emmy Kluemper, a content creator who has been posting TikTok videos that promote a more budget-conscious lifestyle.",
      "Kluemper said she aims to \u201cde-influence\u201d new audiences against overspending on traditions, like home decorating around the holidays.",
      "\u201cI think on social media, sometimes it becomes normalized that every year you need to have a new Christmas aesthetic,\u201d said Kluemper, who is the sole provider for her household. \u201cBut I think for the majority of people, that\u2019s just not realistic.\u201d",
      "Sarah Falls, a mom based in Darwin, Australia, said she uses TikTok to \u201cbe open and honest\u201d about the difficulties of parenting, including buying gifts on a budget.",
      "This holiday season, she documented how she is thrifting Christmas gifts for her three children on a $150 budget. She has posted several hauls, which have drawn both praise and scrutiny from some of her 25,000 followers. Some critics have expressed feelings of disappointment for Falls\u2019 children. But the creator has emphasized that her kids \u201cdo not go without.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you are hard on money or you want to go down the sustainability track, then you have another option,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend thousands of dollars for your kids to have a good Christmas.\u201d",
      "From a financial perspective, Rathner, of NerdWallet, said it\u2019s never too early to start planning holiday budgets and even purchasing gifts. Shopping without a plan, she said, is often the cause of overspending.",
      "\u201cBefore you set your gift list and set your budget, see if you could adjust expectations among all the people you\u2019re going to be surrounding [the] holiday with,\u201d she added, emphasizing that many may \u201csuffer in silence\u201d financially during the holidays.",
      "Kluemper shared a similar perspective, noting that it\u2019s the thoughtful gifts that are \u201cappreciated the most.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can suck the joy out of the season if you\u2019re getting stressed about keeping up with other people,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that they see the way we handle it and understand there will always be people that have more, that have the nicer, the newer, whatever it is, but you can be grateful and thankful for the season that you\u2019re in.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u2019Tis the season for gifting, and young people aren\u2019t leaving themselves out.",
      "Nearly half of Gen Z (47%) and millennial (43%) consumers plan to buy gifts for themselves this holiday season, according to researchers at the consulting firm Deloitte. That\u2019s far ahead of the 27% of Gen-Xers and 15% of baby boomers who plan to do the same.",
      "A value-driven caution has settled into holiday gift buying this year, and retailers are dangling deals and promotions to attract increasingly frugal shoppers \u2014 including those thinking twice about treating themselves.",
      "But during the busy Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales weekend, Gen Z shoppers broke with other age cohorts to expand their self-gifting plans, from 65% last year to 69% this year, Deloitte found. Clothing and accessories, health and wellness, electronics, and experiences like travel and live events are some of the most popular categories for this type of holiday buying.",
      "At this age, I can just buy things for myself, so I\u2019m going to.",
      "Lexi Zaragoza, 26, Santa Barbara, Calif.",
      "Lexi Zaragoza, a 26-year-old children\u2019s social worker in Santa Barbara, California, said her biggest personal splurge this year was a gold locket from the jewelry brand Catbird.",
      "\u201cAt this age, I can just buy things for myself, so I\u2019m going to,\u201d she said.",
      "Zaragoza has been in her current role for two and a half years, her first full-time job after earning a master\u2019s degree in 2022. She also teaches cycling fitness classes on the side and said she\u2019s now making enough to comfortably shop for loved ones this season and treat herself, too.",
      "Like virtually every generation that came before them, Gen-Zers and millennials have been criticized as coddled and self-absorbed, but some of their purchasing decisions that may look narcissistic to others could reflect basic economic realities, experts say.",
      "After adjusting for inflation, Gen Z and millennial workers \u2014 generally defined as those ages 12-27 and 28-43, respectively \u2014\u00a0have higher median incomes than previous generations did at the same age, and they\u2019re also more likely to be optimistic about the economy.",
      "The two generational cohorts have been expected to drive holiday sales growth this year, while Gen-Xers and baby boomers pull back. Gen-Zers\u2019 holiday budgets are expected to increase 37% this season, more than double the 16% growth expected from millennials, according to forecasters at the accounting firm PwC.",
      "\u201cGen Z is a big bright spot,\u201d says Lupine Skelly, a retail research leader at Deloitte. \u201cThey\u2019ve got massive spending potential.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s partly because young adults typically don\u2019t have as many big financial responsibilities like those that come with having families, owning property or caring for aging loved ones. They\u2019re waiting longer to have children and, given the forbidding housing market, less likely to have a mortgage than older generations.",
      "Gen Z is a big bright spot. They\u2019ve got massive spending potential.",
      "Lupine Skelly, retail research leader, Deloitte",
      "And while the deep socioeconomic divides throughout the U.S. economy hold true for young adults too, many of those from middle- and upper-income households appear to have some extra clout as consumers. Indeed, Gen-Zers are much more likely to be authorized users of their parents\u2019 credit cards than millennials were at the same age, a TransUnion report earlier this year found.",
      "In some cases, \u201cmaybe their parents are still paying for their insurance or their cellphones,\u201d said Skelly. \u201cThere\u2019s just a little more flexibility in their budgets.\u201d",
      "Zaragoza said she sees some of these realities among her peers: \u201cAll my friends, none of us have kids. I think it\u2019s hard for older generations to see us frivolously spending money like this, because at their age, they were focused on their family.\u201d",
      "But Skelly said much Gen Z purchasing isn\u2019t frivolous. Each year, the group moves further into adulthood and is faced with buying the necessities that come with first jobs and apartments \u2014 everything from couches to cars.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have the amount of stuff that the rest of us have,\u201d she said. And the attractive discounts on offer this holiday season have made it a good time to spring for purchases that they need anyway and that would have been steeper during most other times of the year.",
      "Another factor that could be driving self-gifting is Gen Z\u2019s high engagement with social influencer marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an ad on television,\u201d said Rodney Mason, head of marketing at LTK, the largest creator commerce platform. It\u2019s much more personalized: \u201cThey\u2019re not saying, \u2018Hey, go buy these jeans.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, influencers deliver daily lifestyle content on platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram that mirrors an aspirational version of their audiences\u2019 own lives. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of like friends,\u201d said Mason \u2014 friends who have \u201call the coolest stuff.\u201d",
      "That has left many young social media users with highly individualized wish lists. Many who have held off for months on making a coveted purchase are finally seeing those items go on sale, and \u201cthey\u2019re going to pull the trigger,\u201d Mason said.",
      "Retailers have also been tailoring their holiday ads toward self-gifters, with brands like Oura Ring emphasizing self-care in recent years. The company said it saw a big jump in sales growth last year when it urged customers to \u201cGive yourself the gift of health.\u201d",
      "This year, its marketing chief told Modern Retail ahead of Black Friday, \u201cWe\u2019re not being shy about it. The pace of all our lives keeps getting crazier, and leaning into self-care during the holiday season feels very natural.\u201d",
      "Zaragoza said she\u2019s thinking beyond short-term self-care to invest in items that will last her a lifetime.",
      "\u201cSolid-gold jewelry, things for the home, things that I was going to buy anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cso I might as well get them at a better deal at this time.\u201d"

      "But they do pose a question that probes into the black box of music-industry economics: How much money does the song earn for Carey, the song\u2019s performer and so-called \u201cQueen of Christmas,\u201d each year?",
      "Revenue estimates by\u00a0Billboard\u00a0suggest she made perhaps $2.7 million to $3.3 million in 2022, for example, from song downloads and on-demand streaming. It excludes other potentially lucrative revenue streams like Christmas TV specials.",
      "But it\u2019s hard to know a precise sum, largely because contractual details between Carey, her music label and song publishers aren\u2019t public, experts said. The pop star\u2019s publicist, Chris Chambers, didn\u2019t return a request for comment submitted to his firm, The Chamber Group, about her royalties.",
      "\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Natasha Chee, a music, entertainment and intellectual property attorney at law firm Donahue Fitzgerald.",
      "The song may have earned $103 million since 1994",
      "\u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d is a yuletide juggernaut.",
      "Spotify\u00a0announced\u00a0this month that the anthem was the first-ever holiday song to surpass 2 billion global streams. It has been the No. 1 song globally on Christmas Day each year since 2016, Spotify said.",
      "The tune\u2019s popularity has only grown: Total U.S. audio streams rose to 249 million in 2023, up about 49% from 167 million in 2019, according to Luminate, which tracks music industry data.",
      "(As of Dec. 12, total U.S. streams of the song this year were down 8% relative to 2023, Billboard estimated. That\u2019s partly a function of the shorter holiday season from a late Thanksgiving, experts said.)",
      "The song \u201cis a money machine,\u201d said George Howard, a professor at the Berklee College of Music and former president of Rykodisc, an independent record label. \u201cIt\u2019s a real phenomenon,\u201d he said.",
      "Howard, who also does consulting work to value music copyrights, estimates the chart-topper makes $2 million to $4 million in annual gross revenue.",
      "Similarly, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, which specializes in music industry law, estimates the hit generates $3.4 million a year.",
      "Over its 30-year existence, the song has made about $103 million in earnings, the law firm estimates. The projections include global streaming and non-streaming revenue sources, according to Manatt, which created Billboard\u2019s\u00a0royalty calculator.",
      "The song\u2019s 2 billion global Spotify streams alone earned $9.8 million in royalties, according to the calculator.",
      "But Carey only gets a portion of those earnings.",
      "Why Carey is likely getting paid \u2018six ways to Sunday\u2019",
      "The ecosystem of music royalties is notoriously convoluted.",
      "Money flows to many contributors, like writers, performers, producers, sound mixers and record labels. Payouts to each person can vary from song to song, depending on contractual terms, experts said.",
      "The terms of Carey\u2019s royalty deals aren\u2019t public knowledge.",
      "The singer is likely getting a \u201cbigger chunk\u201d of revenue than most artists, Howard said. That\u2019s because of Carey\u2019s multiple credits on the song: She\u2019s listed as the sole performer, as well as its co-writer and co-producer. (Walter Afanasieff is the other co-writer and co-producer.)",
      "Such a multitude of credits is unusual to see, Howard said. And it\u2019s an important factor in Carey\u2019s ultimate take-home pay.",
      "Music royalties are different from those of other works like books or photography.",
      "That\u2019s because there are two distinct royalty streams \u2014 one for music composition and another for sound recording, said Jordan Bromley, partner and head of Manatt Entertainment. Think of the former like the sheet music sitting on your piano (the songwriting), and the latter as the recorded song that you hear, he said.",
      "Each has its own royalty structure. The royalties for music composition are received by songwriters and publishers, while those for sound recording are paid to song performers and their labels, Howard said.",
      "Carey \u201chas both the copyright to the song and the sound recording, so she\u2019s getting paid on both sides,\u201d Howard said.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s getting paid six ways to Sunday,\u201d he said.",
      "A song\u2019s writers and publishers \u2014 and not its performers \u2014 get the royalties when a song plays in a public space, such as on TV and radio, or in restaurants and retail stores, experts said. The U.S. is one of the few countries to have such a rule, Howard said.",
      "This means that Carey (and Afanasieff, her co-writer) gets royalties whenever a cover version of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d plays in the public domain. Over 150 performers have covered the song,\u00a0according\u00a0to ASCAP, a performing rights organization.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff split their writing credits with publishers including Universal Music, Sony Music and Kobalt Songs Music Publishing,\u00a0according\u00a0to ASCAP.",
      "However, song recording generally brings in four to five times the revenue of songwriting, Bromley said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a songwriter with no record revenue, it\u2019s hard to make a living even if you\u2019re making hits,\u201d he said.",
      "The artist\u2019s take of the recording revenue relative to the label\u2019s can swing widely, anywhere from 20% up to 90%, depending on the contract, Bromley said. \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d was released by Columbia Records, which is owned by Sony Music.",
      "Afanasieff, Sony Music and Kobalt Songs Music Publishing didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Universal Music Publishing Group declined comment.",
      "Why Carey may have made over $2.7 million in 2022",
      "Experts note that earnings from record sales and licensing can vary greatly from year to year, while revenue from streaming and performance is more predictable.",
      "Of the aforementioned estimated $8.5 million in global revenue and publishing royalties that \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d earned in 2022, the Carey master recording brought in $5.3 million and publishing royalties accounted for the remaining $3.2 million, Billboard said.",
      "What was Carey\u2019s cut?",
      "She made about $1.9 million of the master recording revenue, Billboard estimated, while her label, Sony, kept the other $3.4 million.",
      "Carey also earned an estimated $1.6 million of the publishing, assuming she and Afanasieff split the writing 50-50. But her take-home pay would have been less, depending on her publishing deal \u2014 perhaps ranging from about $795,000 to $1.4 million, Billboard said.",
      "All told, these estimates suggest Carey may have made about $2.7 million to $3.3 million from recording and publishing in 2022.",
      "This excludes revenue from any financial arrangements for soundtracks from Christmas TV specials, which are likely lucrative, according to Billboard. It also excludes cover versions of the song.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of revenue that opens up\u201d for a pop star who is almost \u201cco-branded\u201d with Christmas, including deals for brand endorsements, live performances, cosmetics, home goods and apparel, Manatt Entertainment\u2019s Bromley said.",
      "The gift that keeps giving",
      "The song is the gift that will keep keep on giving for years, experts said.",
      "The copyright for works published after Jan. 1, 1978, generally remains\u00a0intact\u00a0for the author\u2019s lifetime, plus 70 years after the author\u2019s death, according to Chee of Donahue Fitzgerald.",
      "In the case of a joint work with two or more authors, such as \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You,\u201d the rule applies to the last surviving author.",
      "That means Carey\u2019s estate will likely rake in royalties for decades, until the song eventually passes into the public domain, she said. When that happens, the song would join the ranks of Christmas classics like \u201cJingle Bells\u201d and \u201cWe Wish You a Merry Christmas,\u201d which can generally be\u00a0freely shared and adapted."

    "summary": "Film director RaMell Ross is unapologetic about his focus on the Black South in his work, including his latest film \u2018Nickel Boys.\u2019",
    "story": [
      "Film director RaMell Ross is unapologetic about his focus on the Black South in his work. His first feature-length documentary, \u201cHale County This Morning, This Evening,\u201d captures the educational experiences, the class struggles and the reverberations of Jim Crow segregation in an Alabama community, earning him an Oscar nomination in 2019.",
      "\u201cNickel Boys,\u201d Ross\u2019 first narrative feature, falls in line with his professional and personal mission. He and producer Joslyn Barnes adapted the film from Colson Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2019 novel, \u201cThe Nickel Boys.\u201d",
      "The story is set at the fictional Nickel Academy, based on the notoriously cruel Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys near Tallahassee, Florida, which operated for 111 years before being shut down by the Department of Justice in 2011. Far worse than the white children in the institution\u2019s charge, Black children were physically and emotionally abused in the hundreds with no accountability. Nearly 100 teens and boys \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 died on its grounds, with many buried in unmarked graves.",
      "\u201cIt seemed perfect for me to adapt,\u201d said Ross, who lives part time in Alabama. \u201cI was a Black boy, and I can see myself specifically in Elwood because I grew up with a lot of love. I was a really, really, really good kid because I was afraid something small would happen and it would just escalate, and life would be derailed, and I\u2019d let my parents down and everything they\u2019ve done would go to waste.\u201d",
      "For Ross, \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is also very much tied to his acclaimed documentary.",
      "\u201cI think I made an unintentional proof of concept when I made \u2018Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\u2019 and the aesthetics of this film are an evolution of that,\u201d he admitted.",
      "Of the two main characters in \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d Jack Turner, played by Brandon Wilson, is more seasoned and he befriends the more na\u00efve Elwood Curtis, whose bright future as a college student in the early 1960s ends when he accepts a ride from an older Black man in a stolen car.",
      "Turner and Elwood offer the audience entry into the heinous world of Nickel, a segregated juvenile correctional facility for boys. Unlike Turner, Elwood, played by Ethan Herisse, has a loving grandmother Hattie, played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, who does her best to protect him as a child and fights to free him from Dozier.",
      "Ross said it was important that the actors playing Elwood and Turner seem timeless. \u201cThere\u2019s something about making historical productions or exploring history in which we over-index on the symbolism, the speech, the clothing and the background, the environment, that pushes it into this bizarre capsule of history,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cI would argue there\u2019s something unconscious that happens, in which you\u2019re like, \u2018They\u2019re not like us. They\u2019re not the exact same as us. Or there\u2019s something different. Times were different,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cWe were insistent on finding two boys that felt like now, that could also feel like then, which is kind of now, which is also then.\u201d",
      "Ross also shared his awe of Ellis-Taylor, whom he, along with Herisse and Wilson, presented the Social Impact Award for their film during the Critics Choice Association Celebration of Black Cinema & Television in Los Angeles this month.",
      "\u201cShe actually lives the character, which is a little bit distressing when the scenes are really, really emotional because we shoot them four or five times,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ellis-Taylor knows it is part of the job.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of work that I want to do,\u201d said Ellis-Taylor, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in 2021\u2019s \u201cKing Richard,\u201d and is beginning to receive Oscar buzz for \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m beyond blessed to work with someone like RaMell Ross, to work with Ethan Herisse, to work with Brandon Wilson, and to be a part of storytelling that I feel gives some justice to those children at the Dozier School.\u201d",
      "Determining how to present the brutality of this painful history without glorifying it or morphing it into trauma porn was a huge challenge for Ross, who is more than aware of how irresponsibly violence against Black bodies has historically been captured in photography, film and even on the news.",
      "In contrast, Ross pondered ways to capture how \u201csomatic, psychological and completely absorbed\u201d that brutality is. It comes through in the way the film is shot through various characters\u2019 point of view.",
      "Accolades for Ross indicate that the critics like his approach.

    "title": "Kerry Washington's 'Six Triple Eight' shows the important role Black women played in WWII",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Kerry Washington stars in 'Six Triple Eight' about Women Army Corps\u2019 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, who took on a herculean task during World War II.",
    "story": [
      "The job was considered impossible: Clear 17 million pieces of backlogged mail. In a war zone.",
      "Maj. Charity Adams knew it was a mission that could not fail, not just for the sake of morale of World War II troops, but also for the reputation of Black people in the eyes of the country\u2019s top military brass. The real-life efforts of the 855 women of the Women Army Corps\u2019 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion are captured in Tyler Perry\u2019s latest film, \u201cSix Triple Eight,\u201d streaming now on Netflix.",
      "To Kerry Washington, who portrays Adams, the battalion\u2019s ability to resolve an ongoing problem in the face of discrimination while also being underestimated by others around them felt like both a herculean task and an all-too-familiar scenario.",
      "\u201cWhen these women were asked to solve this problem, it was a problem that lots of people had tried to fix, and nobody could,\u201d Washington said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cThey came in and, as Black women do, they figured out how to fix a situation that seemed impossible to fix, and by doing so, they returned hope and purpose and belonging and love to the soldiers to help end the war.\u201d",
      "Mary McLeod Bethune, head of the National Council of Negro Women and a member of what was known as President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNegro Cabinet,\u201d whom Oprah Winfrey plays in the film, advocated for Black women to serve in the war. But while Black women were admitted to the military, they were segregated from white women and given very little to do. Because top military brass deemed Black people generally inferior, many doubted a successful outcome to clearing endless piles of mail.",
      "\u201cBack then, mail was how you stayed connected to the people you love,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThere was no WhatsApp, no texting, no emailing, no FaceTiming. Rarely could you get to a landline phone. People didn\u2019t have cellphones, so mail was it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when soldiers weren\u2019t getting mail, they no longer had hope. They had lost their sense of purpose.\u201d",
      "The unit\u2019s work had been forgotten by most \u2014 even Perry, the director, did not know about the 6888th\u2019s work until producer Nicole Avant contacted him about taking it on.",
      "During a Q&A last month after a screening of the film on his home turf, Atlanta, Perry told the crowd, filled with members of the National Association of Black Military Women, how meeting Lena Derriecott Bell King, then 99, a member of the 6888th, showed him that he could apply her life experiences to help tell the remarkable story. Perry was also fortunate to screen an early version of the film for King before she died on Jan.18, nine days shy of her 101st birthday.",
      "To play 17-year-old Lena Derriecott, Perry tapped Ebony Obsidian, who stars in his long-running series \u201cSistas\u201d on BET.",
      "The role came as a surprise to Obsidian. When he asked her to read the script, she did not realize it was a true story or that he wanted her in his film.",
      "\u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought about me playing Lena when I read the script,\u201d she said with Washington by her side.",
      "Obsidian, whose other credits include the Barry Jenkins film \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and the Hulu series \u201cWu-Tang: An American Saga,\u201d admits she was worried about portraying the lead but said she was honored Perry would select her. Her mother\u2019s urging and reminder of her childhood nickname, \u201cLittle Soldier,\u201d helped persuade her \u201cto take this no matter how intimidating it is,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cMeeting with Lena was the biggest gift,\u201d Obsidian added. \u201cShe obviously was 100 years old when I met her, but at 17, I feel like there are certain elements about her that had to be the same, that had to just be noble.\u201d",
      "Washington did not get to meet the real Adams, who died in 2002 at age 83, but she still felt guided by her.",
      "\u201cShe passed, but she wrote a really beautiful memoir called \u2018One Woman\u2019s Army\u2019 that I read a couple times,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI devoured it, and I used to have portions of the memoir hanging up in my dressing room. I surrounded myself with pictures of her and watched archival footage and interviewed people who knew her and worked with her and listened to old interviews. I just really tried to submerge myself in as much of her soul and essence as I could.\u201d",
      "Washington said finding the commander\u2019s actual trunk from World War II, containing her clothes and handwritten notes, outside her dressing room after having rehearsed one of Adams\u2019 monologues with Perry felt like an approval.",
      "But how Washington speaks in the film has generated the most interest, including from her own kids, who asked, \u201cWhose voice is that?\u201d after she played them the trailer. To achieve that distinctive voice, which sounds like a sharp Southern twang punctuated by precise Midwestern enunciation, perhaps reflecting Adams\u2019 South Carolina upbringing and schooling at Wilberforce University in Ohio, Washington worked hard with both an accent coach and her acting coach.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t have amplification back then. It wasn\u2019t like she was standing there with a karaoke machine,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if I had the kind of responsibility and command and calling that she had, where would that live in my body? How would that impact my posture? How would it impact my voice? How would it impact my resonance and my need to be heard by these women so that they felt seen and heard by me? Those are some of the questions that I asked to help me figure out where that vocal performance came from.\u201d",
      "Washington and Obsidian said they are grateful to be at the center of a film celebrating Black women\u2019s strength, excellence and sisterhood, which Obsidian said also shows that \u201cyou can overcome anything you need to overcome with the right support and the right people by your side.\u201d",
      "Washington said: \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to be part of, in some ways, corrective history. We are telling a story that has been pushed into the margins about some true heroes, not just American heroes, but heroes of democracy all over the world.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The movie, premiering this month, is based on real events in the early 1990s, when a group of young people in Cuba were looking for freedom from government repression.",
    "story": [
      "A coming-of-age movie with a dramatic punk rock twist has a storyline that may sound unreal, but it's based on true events.",
      "In \"Los Frikis,\" set in early 1990s Cuba, hundreds of young, disenfranchised Cubans inject themselves with HIV during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, hoping to escape political repression by going inside government-run clinics, or sanitariums.",
      "Based on true events, the film takes its title from the Spanish translation of the word \u201cfreaky,\u201d referring to the punk rock movement that came together in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "\u201cI grew up in Miami, I have Cuban family, Cuban friends, but I didn\u2019t know this story specifically, so it was very important for me to tell it,\u201d said one of the movie's leads, Puerto Rican Guatemalan actor Adria Arjona.",
      "Arjona, who starred earlier this year in the romantic comedy crime movie \"Hit Man\" and is known for her roles in the series \"Andor\" and \"True Detective,\" spoke to NBC News alongside two of the movie's co-stars, H\u00e9ctor Medina and Eros de la Puente.",
      "\"Los Frikis\" was written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \"The Peanut Butter Falcon,\" the 2019 comedy drama about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from a care facility.",
      "During the AIDS crisis, Cuba's sanitariums drew both praise and criticism. While they were credited with containing the spread of HIV on the communist island, the clinics were described as \u201ca pretty prison\u201d by Dr. Jonathan Mann, the first AIDS director at the World Health Organization.",
      "According to an article in\u00a0The Lancet, Cuba had 927 cases of HIV seropositivity and 187 cases of AIDS as of May 1993. By comparison, neighboring Puerto Rico, with roughly one-third the population of Cuba, had over 8,000 cases of AIDS at the time, and New York City, with a population closer in size to Cuba, had 43,000 patients with AIDS then.",
      "But Cuba\u2019s health policy led to \"unintended consequences,\" The New York Times wrote in 2012 about this period.",
      "\u201cTo stay out, some Cubans tried to avoid testing. But a few others, usually teenagers estranged from their families, deliberately got themselves infected to get in,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times reported.",
      "Patients were initially confined to the medical center by the military. But life inside, which ultimately inspired \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d could also be less austere than what these punk rockers faced on the streets.",
      "\u201cInmates got food, medical care and their old salaries; theater troupes and art classes formed. Gay men could live together, which was not true in the macho culture outside,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the story of this second young group, who lived in a Cuba that was increasingly isolated after the fall of the Berlin Wall\u00a0in 1989 and the ensuing demise of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc. Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionary government cracked down in response to dissidents and others who didn't fit in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll throw you in jail for anything here. It\u2019s impossible to survive without breaking the law,\u201d Paco (played by Medina), one of the punk rockers in the film, says.",
      "Paco, like other young people, believed he could escape from government repression by entering a sanitarium after injecting himself with HIV.\u00a0Punk bands started forming at these medical centers, and recorded cassettes inspired hundreds to self-inject.",
      "But many would soon face a rude awakening as they died of AIDS; it would be years before the current treatments that have made it possible to live with HIV as a manageable condition.",
      "Medina \u2014 who will play Ra\u00fal Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro and the former president of Cuba, in an upcoming movie with Al Pacino \u2014\u00a0said that he\u00a0prepared for his role in \u201cLos Frikis\u201d by speaking to a sanitarium doctor who now lives in the U.S.",
      "The doctor had worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium about 30 minutes\u00a0southwest from Havana by car. He told Medina that it was painful to remember, since he had become friends with his patients who later died of AIDS.",
      "Medina said much of the punk music that Los Frikis made at the time was not preserved. But viewers could still connect with the very positive message of their culture in the film, which shows how they found freedom in friendship, love and the communities they created at the sanitariums.",
      "This message, Arjona said, transforms the \u201cFrikis\u201d from scary outcasts to relatable people who are vulnerable and want to heal from different traumas.",
      "In the movie, Arjona\u2019s character, Mar\u00eda, tells Gustavo (played by de la Puente) that \u201cyou can\u2019t expect to hold onto anything.\u201d",
      "Faced with the deaths of her peers, Mar\u00eda poetically says that loved ones, sunsets and even cherished animals like horses eventually disappear.",
      "This makes de la Puente think about one of the most enduring messages from the Frikis movement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need many things to have everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am referring in the context of the film, and how that group of people becomes a family and creates such a beautiful experience in a moment from the history of Cuba that was very empty.\u201d",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d releases in New York and Los Angeles on Friday and\u00a0select movie theaters nationwide Dec. 25."

      "The Summary",
      "The bird flu outbreak took several concerning turns this year, with the number of human cases up to at least 64.Experts outlined several indicators that the virus\u2019 spread is going in the wrong direction.Among them are recent detections of the virus in wastewater and signs of dangerous mutations.",

      "Among them are recent detections of the virus in wastewater and signs of dangerous mutations.",
      "The simmering threat of bird flu may be inching closer to boiling over.",
      "This year has been marked by a series of concerning developments in the virus\u2019 spread. Since April, at least 64 people have tested positive for the virus \u2014 the first U.S. cases other than a single infection in 2022. Dairy cow herds in 16 states have been infected this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the country\u2019s first severe bird flu infection on Wednesday, a critically ill patient in Louisiana. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency this week in response to rampant outbreaks in cows and poultry.",
      "\u201cThe traffic light is changing from green to amber,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases. \u201cSo many signs are going in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "No bird flu transmission between humans has been documented, and the CDC maintains that the immediate risk to public health is low. But scientists are increasingly worried, based on four key signals.",
      "For one, the bird flu virus \u2014 known as H5N1 \u2014 has spread uncontrolled in animals, including cows frequently in contact with people. Additionally, detections in wastewater show the virus is leaving a wide-ranging imprint, and not just in farm animals.",
      "Then there are several cases in humans where no source of infection has been identified, as well as research about the pathogen\u2019s evolution, which has shown that the virus is evolving to better fit human receptors and that it will take fewer mutations to spread among people.",
      "Together, experts say, these indicators suggest the virus has taken steps toward becoming the next pandemic.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very precarious situation right now,\u201d said Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Widespread circulation creates new pathways to people",
      "Since this avian flu outbreak began in 2022, the virus has become widespread in wild birds, commercial poultry and wild mammals like sea lions, foxes and black bears. More than 125 million poultry birds have died of infections or been culled in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "An unwelcome surprise arrived in March, when dairy cows began to fall ill, eat less feed and produce discolored milk.",
      "Research showed the virus was spreading rapidly and efficiently between cows, likely through raw milk, since infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands. Raccoons and farm cats appeared to get sick by drinking raw milk, too.",
      "The more animals get infected, the higher the chances of exposure for the humans who interact with them.",
      "\u201cThe more people infected, the more possibility mutations could occur,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and the director of the Brown University School of Public Health\u2019s Pandemic Center. \u201cI don\u2019t like giving the virus a runway to a pandemic.\u201d",
      "Until this year, cows hadn\u2019t been a focus of influenza prevention efforts.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t think dairy cattle were a host for flu, at least a meaningful host,\u201d Andrew Bowman, a professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University, told NBC News this summer.",
      "But now, the virus has been detected in at least 865 herds of cows across at least 16 states, as well as in raw (unpasteurized) milk sold in California and in domestic cats who drank raw milk.",
      "\u201cThe ways in which a community and consumers are directly at risk now is in raw milk and cheese products,\u201d Chin-Hong said. \u201cA year ago, or even a few months ago, that risk was lower.\u201d",
      "Cases with no known source of exposure",
      "The majority of the human H5N1 infections have been among poultry and dairy farmworkers. But in several puzzling cases, no source of infection has been identified.",
      "The first was a hospitalized patient in Missouri who tested positive in August and recovered. Another was a California child whose infection was reported in November.",
      "Additionally, Delaware health officials reported a case of H5N1 this week in a person without known exposure to poultry or cattle. But CDC testing could not confirm the virus was bird flu, so the agency considers it a \u201cprobable\u201d case.",
      "In Canada, a British Columbia teenager was hospitalized in early November after contracting H5N1 without any known exposure to farm or wild animals. The virus\u2019 genetic material suggested it was similar to a strain circulating in waterfowl and poultry.",
      "Such unexplained cases are giving some experts pause.",
      "\u201cThat suggests this virus may be far more out there and more people might be exposed to it than we previously thought,\u201d Nuzzo said.",
      "Rising levels of bird flu in wastewater",
      "To better understand the geography of bird flu\u2019s spread, scientists are monitoring wastewater for fragments of the virus.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen detections in a lot more places, and we\u2019ve seen a lot more frequent detections\u201d in recent months, said Amy Lockwood, the public health partnerships lead at Verily, a company that provides wastewater testing services to the CDC and a program called WastewaterSCAN.",
      "Earlier this month, about 19% of the sites in the CDC\u2019s National Wastewater Surveillance System \u2014 across at least 10 states \u2014 reported positive detections.",
      "It\u2019s not possible to know if the virus fragments found came from animal or human sources. Some could have come from wild bird excrement that enters storm drains, for example.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think any of this is an indication of human-to-human transmission now, but there is a lot of H5 virus out there,\u201d said Peggy Honein, the director of the Division of Infectious Disease Readiness & Innovation at the CDC.",
      "Lockwood and Honein said the wastewater detections have mostly been in places where dairy is processed or near poultry operations, but in recent months, mysterious hot spots have popped up in areas without such agricultural facilities.",
      "\u201cWe are starting to see it in more and more places where we don\u2019t know what the source might be automatically,\u201d Lockwood said, adding: \u201cWe are in the throes of a very big numbers game.\u201d",
      "One mutation away?",
      "Until recently, scientists who study viral evolution thought H5N1 would need a handful of mutations to spread readily between humans.",
      "But research published in the journal Science this month found that the version of the virus circulating in cows could bind to human receptors after a single mutation. (The researchers were only studying proteins in the virus, not the full, infectious virus.)",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to assume that because of this finding that a pandemic is likely to happen. We only want to make the point that the risk is increased as a result of this,\u201d said paper co-author Jim Paulson, the chair of molecular medicine at Scripps Research.",
      "Separately, scientists in recent months have identified concerning elements in another version of the virus, which was found in the Canadian teenager who got seriously ill. Virus samples showed evidence of mutations that could make it more amenable to spreading between people, Hensley said.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said it\u2019s unlikely the virus had those mutations when the teen was exposed.",
      "\u201cIt is most likely that the mixture of changes in this virus occurred after prolonged infection of the patient,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The agency\u2019s investigations do not suggest that \u201cthe virus is adapting to readily transmit between humans,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "The viral strain in the United States\u2019 first severe bird flu case, announced on Wednesday, was from the same lineage as the Canadian teen\u2019s infection.",
      "Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the CDC is assessing a sample from that patient to determine if it has any concerning mutations.",
      "Hensley, meanwhile, said he\u2019s concerned that flu season could offer the virus a shortcut to evolution. If someone gets co-infected with a seasonal flu virus and bird flu, the two can exchange chunks of genetic code.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need for mutation \u2014 the genes just swap,\u201d Hensley said, adding that he hopes farmworkers get flu shots to limit such opportunities.",
      "Future testing and vaccines",
      "Experts said plenty can be done to better track bird flu\u2019s spread and prepare for a potential pandemic. Some of that work has already begun.",
      "The USDA on Tuesday expanded bulk testing of milk to a total of 13 states, representing about 50% of the nation\u2019s supply.",
      "Nuzzo said that effort can\u2019t ramp up soon enough.",
      "\u201cWe have taken way too long to implement widespread bulk milk testing. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re finding most outbreaks on farms,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time, Andrew Trister, chief medical and scientific officer at Verily, said the company is working to improve its wastewater analysis in the hope of identifying concerning mutations.",
      "The USDA has also authorized field trials to vaccinate cows against H5N1. Hensley said his laboratory has tested a new mRNA vaccine in calves.",
      "For humans, the federal government has two bird flu vaccines stockpiled, though they would need Food and Drug Administration authorization.",
      "Nuzzo said health officials should offer the vaccines to farmworkers.",
      "\u201cWe should not wait for farmworkers to die before we act,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, scientists are developing new mRNA vaccines against H5N1. This type of vaccine, which was first used against Covid-19, can be more quickly tailored to particular viral strains and also scaled more quickly.",
      "Hensley\u2019s lab in May reported that one mRNA vaccine candidate offered protection against the virus to ferrets during preclinical testing. Another candidate under development by the CDC and Moderna has also showed promising results in ferrets, which are often used as a model for humans to study influenza.",
      "\u201cNow we just have to go through the clinical trials,\u201d Hensley said."

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, tells the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields and how she overcame all odds to be one of the greatest female boxers alive.",
      "Though Shields accomplished much in her life, including becoming the \"first American boxer (male or female) ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games,\" her road to victory was anything but easy.",
      "She grew up in poverty in Flint, Michigan to a mother who battled alcoholism and a father who was in jail during the early years of her life. At age 11, Shields started boxing with the help of her coach Jason Crutchfield, played by Brian Tyree Henry in the film, and that helped her deal with a lot of anger she had while growing up.",
      "\"I was molested and raped. But I channeled all the anger from that into boxing, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so successful at it,\" she told ESPN of her childhood. \"Boxing really helped with that. It calmed me down a lot and gave me discipline and structure.\"",

      "Claressa Shields, aka T-Rex, is an American professional boxer from Flint, Michigan. In 2012, Shields headed to the Olympics at 17 years old and became the first American woman to win gold in boxing. Then, four years later at the 2016 Olympics, she did it again when she secured her second gold medal.",
      "Now at age 29, Shields holds the title as being the first American boxer ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games.",
      "Not to mention, she's also a three-time undisputed champ. The only fight that Shields ever lost in her boxing career was against British World Champion Savannah Marshall just months before the 2012 Olympic Games, per the Olympics. However, she avenged herself in 2022 when the two went head-to-head in London for the middleweight champion title.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Shields explained how she got her nickname \"T-Rex.\" She said she got the moniker as a child when she was \"very skinny\" and had \"short arms.\"",
      "What happened to Claressa Shields after the Olympics?",
      "Shields' life did not change much after she brought home a gold medal in boxing at the 2012 Olympics. That was the same year that women\u2019s boxing became an official Olympic sport.",
      "The self-proclaimed GWOAT (Greatest Woman of All Time) returned home to Flint, Michigan, with no endorsement deals whatsoever.",
      "In the movie, it's said that Shields was still living on her coach's couch after she had just made history at the Olympics.",
      "In an interview with NPR, Shields said that the public wasn't comfortable with her image and she was advised to stop boasting about how she likes to beat people up in her interviews.",
      "\u201cThey had this weird definition of what a strong woman was. For some reason, that definition was pretty, non-sweaty and not as muscular. And one, I\u2019m very pretty. I think I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d said with a grin.",
      "\u201cBut the fact of it is,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen [I\u2019m] boxing, I look so strong and I\u2019m punching so hard and I\u2019m punching so fast, and [I] make people feel intimidated. I think that now people are starting to embrace that. The definition of a strong woman is\u00a0Laila Ali.\u00a0Lucia Rijker. Serena Williams. Claressa Shields.\u201d",
      "Shields told Entertainment Weekly that it was hard for her to see other people get brand deals who didn't win gold medals. She explained that it was also difficult to see brands flock to her friends like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky and then offer her nothing.",
      "\"I felt like my gold medal weighed less than theirs. So to be a 17-year-old going through that and also be in Flint where everybody\u2019s saying, 'They played you, they dissed you, your gold medal didn\u2019t mean anything, you\u2019re not getting what you deserve' \u2014 to hear that for so many years and then go back and do it again was like, 'Oh, man,'\" she said.",
      "How accurate is \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "\"The Fire Inside\" is loosely based on Shields' life so all events in the film are not exactly true. For instance, the movie portrays Shields as a fighter who wanted to win gold at the 2012 Olympics. However, in an interview with ESPN, she said she heavily contemplated whether or not she wanted to come in first.",
      "After she lost her fight against Marshall at the 2012 AIBA world championships in China, Shields said she noticed that the dynamic around her started to change from people believing in her to having doubts about her talents. She said they didn't change their tune until she made it all the way to the finals in the 2012 Olympics.",
      "\"I really hated the fake vibes. I felt it from my Olympic teammates, some of the coaches and from people at home also,\" she said.",
      "Shields couldn't help but think about what her life would be like if she took home silver instead of gold.",
      "\"As I was walking to the ring for my final fight at the Olympics, I was telling myself, 'If you get silver, maybe you won\u2019t have so many fakers and doubters and all this weird stuff around that you don\u2019t want. But if you get gold, it\u2019s going to be all of these people that are gonna come into your life. All these new cousins and all this new stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"I had to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to get gold or silver because the power was in my hands,\" Shields continued. \"Then right before I got into the ring, I took a deep breath and I was like, 'You know what? I\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this gold medal, and however my life changes after this, I\u2019m just going to accept it and deal with it the best way I can. There is no way I\u2019m about to miss out on this opportunity because I\u2019m scared of how many fake people will come around.\u201d",
      "Shields added that people still walk up to her to this day and tell her that they lost money betting against her in the finals.",
      "Was Claressa Shields involved in the \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "Yes, Shields served as an executive producer in \"The Fire Inside\" and she told Entertainment Weekly that she had \"a lot of input\" in how the film was made.",
      "\"Before Barry (Jenkins) wrote the script, we met in person and talked for almost five hours. I let him speak first about what he thought my story was, and when he got done talking, I said, 'Well, you had a few key parts, but this is what I want to tell, what I want them to understand about me,\" she said. \"When he wrote his script a few months later and sent it to me, he got it just right.\"",
      "Shields also hailed Destiny's acting in the film and said she did a \"great job\" playing her in \"The Fire Inside.\"",
      "\"I cry every time I watch the movie,\" Shields said.",
      "What is Claressa Shields doing now?",
      "After the 2016 Olympics, Shields went pro and became a five weight world champion. She reminded ESPN of her accolades when it left her off a list of \"trailblazing\" female athletes that aired on the channel.",
      "In response, Shields took to X to share the ESPN graphic along with a picture of herself holding her championship belts.",
      "In the caption, she wrote, \"Wow @espn. Y\u2019all have really lost yall mind!!!!! Do I have to run my resume down to y\u2019all!!! 2x Olympic champ, 3x Undisputed champ, 5 weight world champion, 15x world champ. WOMENS BOXING TRAIL BLAZER.\"",
      "Shields has since gotten involved in the Mixed Martial Arts scene. In 2021, she made her MMA debut in a fight that she won against Brittney Elkin.",
      "When asked why she wanted to do MMA, Shields told Yahoo Sports in 2021 that she felt like she \"never got her just due in boxing.\" At the time, Shields was a 12-time world champion. She is now a 15-time world champ.",
      "\"You think about becoming a 22-time world champion. It's very easy for myself to do, but it was like, 'What would that do for me? Would that make me a bigger star? Would that make me a household name? Or would that make me a millionaire?'\" she said. \"And the truth is no. It wouldn't open up any more doors to me than what has already been opened.\"",
      "\"I would have to keep fighting this war of equal pay and equal opportunity and getting women equal fight time,\" she continued. \"It just got to a place where I was like, you know what, I've been working so hard and boxing for so many years that if I'm going to work hard at something then at least let me reap what I sow.\""

      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d brought back a fan favorite sketch, this time with a holiday twist.",
      "Martin Short hosted the late night sketch comedy show on Dec. 21 alongside musical guest, Hozier. The episode featured the sketch \u201cParking Lot Altercation,\u201d which served as a callback to when Quinta Brunson hosted in April 2023.",
      "The \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star and creator appeared in a similar sketch called \u201cTraffic Altercation,\u201d wherein she and Mikey Day engaged in some animated and often inappropriate gesturing while they were stuck in a traffic jam on the highway.",
      "This time, Short competed with Day for a parking lot spot at a mall on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.",
      "At the beginning of their exchange, the men try to reasonably communicate their ownership over the spot, with Day insisting that the spot was his with some simple gesturing, while Short claimed that his blinker was on, as conveyed by his aggressive blinking.",
      "Tensions escalated from there, with Day claiming that he reached the spot first, to which Short accused him of being blind. The sketch continued to take dark and inappropriate turns as their argument over the parking spot continued without resolution. At one point, Day\u2019s daughter, portrayed by Chloe Fineman, got involved, albeit with some NSFW gestures.",
      "Day accused Short of being a liar after sharing that he was handicapped due to his high blood pressure, using his hand to gesture his nose growing \u00e0 la Pinocchio. Short responded by claiming he would never lie because he was a \u201csuper Christian\u201d as represented by him doing his best Superman stance and then holding his arms out as if he were on the cross.",
      "Eventually, Short said that if Day wouldn\u2019t listen to him, then maybe he would listen to his wife, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy. Though Day initially didn\u2019t see Short\u2019s wife, McCarthy came in hot on the scene and started to bang on the passenger side window.",

      "After the threats intensified, McCarthy paused to take a sip of an iced coffee before promptly spitting it back out onto the window.",
      "Day and Fineman could barely keep it together as McCarthy used her chest to wipe off the beverage from the window, pausing every few seconds to glare at them before pressing her chest against the window again. At one point, she even licked a line clean off the window so she could get a better look at the duo before creeping away.",
      "That was the final straw in the argument as Day ultimately surrendered the spot to Short who seemed overjoyed by the win.",
      "McCarthy wasn\u2019t the only celebrity cameo during last night\u2019s episode.",
      "The show kicked-off with a star-studded cold open that saw Short being inducted into the Five-Timers Club.",

    "summary": "Blake Lively filed a complaint against her 'It Ends With Us' co-star Justin Baldoni. Here's why she filed a complaint and how Baldoni responded.",
    "story": [
      "Blake Lively has filed a sexual harassment complaint against her \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni.",
      "Lively alleges in an 80-page complaint, filed Dec. 20 and obtained by TODAY.com, that Baldoni created a hostile workplace on the movie's set. The document states the actor later participated in \u201castroturfing\u201d \u2014 defined in the complaint as the deceptive practice of orchestrating a smear campaign under the guise of the public \u2014 as well as a coordinated PR effort to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to Lively\u2019s claims in a statement to TODAY.com, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "In her complaint, Lively claims that filming \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d became so uncomfortable that an \u201call hands\u201d meeting, which included her husband, Ryan Reynolds, was held to address Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath\u2019s alleged \u201cinappropriate conduct.\u201d",
      "During the meeting, according to the complaint, Baldoni and Heath were asked to stop showing nude videos and images of women to Lively and others and to stop discussing their past \u201cpornography addiction\u201d as well as their \u201cpersonal experiences of sex\u201d in front of her and others.",
      "Lively also requested that Baldoni and Heath stop describing their own \u201cgenitalia\u201d in front of others.",
      "The complaint goes on to allege that Lively issued a demand \u2014 which Sony Pictures, the film\u2019s distributor, reportedly approved at the time \u2014 asking that no additional sex scenes or \u201con camera climaxing\u201d beyond what she had previously approved of be added to the film, among other requests regarding the movie\u2019s scenes depicting intimacy.",
      "During the meeting, the complaint says Lively also addressed other issues on the movie\u2019s set and made a request to Baldoni to stop saying he was \u201cspeaking to\u201d her late father, actor Ernie Lively, and for him to stop \u201cpressing\u201d her to discuss her religious beliefs.",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint also notes that after the movie was released, Baldoni engaged in a \u201csocial manipulation\u201d campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation that caused her and her family \u201csevere emotional distress.\u201d",
      "Lively\u2019s suit also included numerous excerpts of texts and emails from Baldoni\u2019s team, which were obtained through a subpoena that she claims detailed a plan to harm Lively\u2019s reputation.",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, Lively said, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint comes months after rumors of a behind-the-scenes feud between Lively and Baldoni began during promotion of \u201cIt Ends with Us.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, Freedman, the attorney for Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, called Lively\u2019s lawsuit a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to repair her reputation.",
      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",
      "\u201cThese claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\u201d Freedman\u2019s statement continued.",
      "\u201cWayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorneys claim that Lively\u2019s team allegedly made up stories about Baldoni to the press before the marketing of the film had even begun.",
      "\u201cWhich was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "\u201cThe representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals,\u201d the statement concluded.",
      "TODAY.com has also reached out to attorneys for Lively and Sony Pictures, who distributed the film, for comment about Baldoni\u2019s response to the complaint.",
      "Rumors of tensions between Lively and Baldoni emerged during promotion of \u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d which was released in theaters in August 2024.",
      "The movie, which is based on Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel of the same name, tells the story of Lily Bloom, a florist (Lively), who falls for a charming neurosurgeon named Ryle (Baldoni) only to find herself trapped in an abusive relationship.",
      "On Dec. 21, Hoover shared a picture of herself hugging Lively to her Instagram story, tagging the actor and seemingly addressing the allegations.",
      "She wrote, \u201c@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patience since the day we met. Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has also reached out to Hoover for comment.",
      "After social media users noted that Baldoni did not pose with Lively \u2014 or any of the movie\u2019s other stars \u2014 at the film\u2019s Aug. 6 premiere in New York, rumors of tensions among the cast circulated online.",
      "The chatter escalated when fans noticed that Lively and author Hoover followed each other and other cast members \u2014 but not Baldoni \u2014 on Instagram.",
      "Baldoni also didn\u2019t participate in group promotional events with the movie\u2019s actors, opting instead to do his interviews with the media alone. Meanwhile, Lively often joined other cast members to speak to the media, including a high-profile Vanity Fair interview that featured Lively and five other actors from the film \u2014 but not Baldoni.",
      "Lively and Baldoni never publicly commented about their alleged feud, and Baldoni notably praised Lively during an Aug. 8 appearance on TODAY for her \u201csmart and creative\u201d contributions to his film.",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in helming the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "However, as rumors of the rift between the pair escalated, Lively began facing a public backlash online from those who criticized her behavior during promotional interviews about the movie, claiming it was at odds with the film\u2019s serious subject matter.",
      "The former \u201cGossip Girl\u201d star also faced criticism online for launching a new hair care line while promoting the film.",
      "Meanwhile, author Hoover came under fire from online critics who accused her of romanticizing domestic violence in her book.",
      "Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas, the former high school boyfriend of Blake Lively\u2019s character, Lily, commented on the multiple controversies surrounding the film in a lengthy statement on Instagram Aug. 20. In his statement, he defended Lively, Hoover and other women involved in the film from online attacks.",
      "In his message, Sklenar wrote that whatever \u201cmay or may not have happened behind the scenes\u201d during shooting of the movie, \u201cshould not detract from what our intentions were in making this film.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online,\u201d he wrote."

      "Why fans believe there\u2019s drama between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively",
      "Online, the volume of a single question surrounding the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d rollout has gone steadily up in the week leading up to the release: Why hasn\u2019t star and director Baldoni been pictured with the rest of the cast?",
      "People on social media have dissected cast appearances and events. At the New York movie premiere Aug. 6, Lively was photographed with an ensemble, including her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and his \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d co-star Hugh Jackman. She also posed with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-stars Brandon Sklenar and Jenny Slate. Baldoni appeared only with his wife, Emily Baldoni, or alone.",
      "Fans also noticed that Lively and Hoover do not follow Baldoni on Instagram, but they follow each other and other cast members like Sklenar and Slate.",
      "Since then, fans have began to speculate about possible tension between Baldoni and Lively. Baldoni did not partake in many group engagements with the cast to promote the film, often doing interviews solo, while Lively was paired with one or more other cast members. Fans on TikTok and YouTube were quick to note Baldoni\u2019s noticeable absence from Vanity Fair\u2019s interview with Lively and five other central actors in the film.",
      "This is part of a trend of fans close-reading press tours by analyzing interviews, red carpet interactions, body language and more for insight into cast dynamics. \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d press tour in 2023, for example, was clouded by rumors of a rift between star Taraji P. Henson and executive producer Oprah Winfrey, which they both denied. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d from 2022, was similarly overshadowed by a rumored feud between the cast and the relationship between a star (Harry Styles) and director (Olivia Wilde).",
      "What have \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 cast members said about an alleged feud?",
      "On Aug. 20, Sklenar became the first cast member to address any perceived iciness.",
      "\u201cColleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in part. \u201cVilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strong in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point. What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film. It\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni have not commented, though Baldoni has spoken highly about Lively and the contributions she made on the film.",
      "During a TODAY appearance Aug. 8, Baldoni said of the movie star: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know how smart and creative she really is. I think she\u2019s best known as an actress and of course she\u2019s a fashion icon, but she\u2019s so much more than that. She\u2019s dynamic, creative. She had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched, she made better.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com that took place after his broadcast appearance, Baldoni spoke to the extent of Lively impact on the movie, along with her husband\u2019s.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t summarize Blake\u2019s contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cRyan (Reynolds) was so generous ... he\u2019s a creative genius, that guy. So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in heading the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "As for Lively, she has not mentioned Baldoni in interviews, though she has been open about her creative touches seen in \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d In an interview with Hits Radio UK on Aug. 11, said she and people involved in the film disagreed over featuring Lana Del Ray\u2019s song \u201cCherry.\u201d Lively was strongly for it, while others were against it \u2014 though she added, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be talking about this.\u201d",
      "Lively on TODAY said she sourced her character Lily\u2019s clothes from her own wardrobe, as well from her friend Gigi Hadid\u2019s and Reynolds\u2019. And in an interview with E! News on the red carpet, Lively revealed her husband wrote the rooftop scene, where Ryle and Lily first meet.",
      "Why did Blake Lively sue Justin Baldoni?",
      "In December 2024, over four months after \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d premiered, Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint, which was obtained by TODAY.com, that she experienced sexual harassment in addition to retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and more.",
      "In the complaint, Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the CEO of Wayfarer Studios and producer on the film, were said to have engaged in \u201cinappropriate and unwelcome behavior\u201d toward Lively and other individuals on the set of the film.",
      "These claims included ignoring industry safeguards for filming intimate scenes, adding in \u201cgratuitous sexual content,\u201d discussing personal sexual experiences, and objectifying women, including Lively.",
      "The complaint also noted that Baldoni and his team proceeded to \u201cformulate a retaliatory plan\u201d due to knowledge the Wayfarer Studios had of the HR complaints made against the actor and Heath\u2019s behavior. It also stated that Baldoni retaliated because the complaints \u201cthreatened his feminist brand.\u201d",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint that due to an \u201cincrease in negative media articles and social media coverage,\u201d she, her family and her businesses all \u201csuffered\u201d and were \u201csubstantially harmed\u201d by Wayfarer Studios\u2019 actions.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children,\u201d the complaint read in part. \u201cThere are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to the complaint in a statement to TODAY.com, sharing that they were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Does \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 romanticize abuse?",
      "While current chatter around \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d surrounds the cast, the story itself has generated controversy. Previously, discourse revolved around its delivery of a heavy subject matter.",
      "Hoover has shared publicly that the story was inspired by her mom, who left her abusive husband (and Hoover\u2019s biological father) when Hoover was 2.",
      "A common criticism of the book was that it romanticized abuse.\u00a0An op-ed published to a domestic shelters non-profit said the BookTok favorite \u201cfeeds into the very structures of toxic masculinity that it purports to combat\u201d by \u201cromanticizing red flags\u201d and glorifies a \u201ccharismatic-but-dangerous man.\u201d",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Baldoni said he and screenwriter Christy Hall made a concerted effort to take criticism into account \u201cfrom the very beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe talked about the criticism. We talked about why that happened. We talked about what we can do to protect the movie from that criticism, and how we can make sure that we inject as much truth into it, so that people can be seen and never feel like their stories are being exploited,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said he \u201ccompletely understands\u201d the criticism.",
      "\u201cI want to validate and support anybody and everybody who\u2019s come out against the book, because the last thing we need is to romanticize something that is such a real experience for so many people\u201d",
      "Baldoni took input from the domestic violence organization No More while making the film and also attended a support group for perpetrators to try to better understand their psychology.",
      "As a result of their effort, the movie changes one of the most controversial plot points from the book: the end of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship.",
      "In the book, although Lily leaves Ryle, he stays part of their daughter\u2019s life and watches her unsupervised for days on end. In the movie, Ryle isn\u2019t seen on screen after their daughter is born at the hospital.",
      "Baldoni told The Wrap the script\u2019s original draft had a scene that involved Ryle dropping off their child and having a short conversation with Lily.",
      "\u201cIt was written in a way that showed that they\u2019ve overcome a lot over the last two years. And I wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "Does the movie\u2019s marketing match its tone?",
      "Some are saying the movie\u2019s packaging is discordant with its subject matter.",
      "\u201cIf you just watch the trailer for this movie \u2026 it looks like a romance,\u201d as pop culture TikToker Jess Spoll said.",
      "The poster sees Lily smiling and surrounded by flowers. The original cover art for the movie took on a different tone. In it, Lily and Ryle stand close together in an embrace. Lily\u2019s face is in focus and she appears to wear an ambiguous impression.",
      "A post shared by It Ends With Us (@itendswithusmovie)",
      "Readers of the book often experienced a similar surprise, like this TikTok points to: \u201cReading \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 thinking it is a cute romance,\u201d the text reads \u2014 before things change, and the true nature of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship emerges.",
      "Since the film's release, people started taking issue with Lively\u2019s promotion of the film.",
      "\u201cJustin is promoting the movie as it is, which is about DV (domestic violence), it\u2019s a very heavy topic, it\u2019s what the book focuses on,\u201d Meredith Mansfield says in a now-viral TikTok video. \u201cWhereas Blake and everybody else are promoting it like a rom-com and that\u2019s rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.\u201d",
      "Mansfield cited an interview with Lively where she suggested people \u201cgrab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see\u201d the film.",
      "In another viral video, TikToker Ashley Paige, who goes by @livingsingle and says she\u2019s a survivor of domestic abuse, addressed Lively in a 5-minute-long video.",

No experience can define you, you define you.\u201d",

A responsibility to all the women who have experienced generational trauma \u2014 domestic abuse \u2014 or struggle with looking in the mirror and loving who they see. This movie is a harsh reality check for the men who need to get their s\u2014 together and take responsibility for themselves and their actions.\u201d",

      "After first premiering in 1994, the NBC sitcom would go on to earn six Primetime Emmys (including an outstanding supporting actress statue for Kudrow) and go down in history as one of the most popular TV shows of all time. The meteoric success and continued popularity of \"Friends\" are due in no small part to the chemistry of its six co-stars, something Kudrow says was genuine.",

      "The dark comedy also stars Romano as Kudrow's husband, Paul, and Denis Leary as his recently paroled brother, along with a host of others, including Luke Wilson, Linda Cardellini and O-T Fagbenle, who portray property-hungry buyers willing to do anything to score the Morgans' prized Spanish-style mansion. All of them have something to hide, including Lydia and Paul.",
      "\"Their son is dead and it's a secret. What was their involvement in that?\" says Kudrow, who explains that she was initially drawn to the role because she enjoys a mystery.",
      "\"I like when the information is teased in a way that makes sense, but definitely feels like, 'Oh, I know exactly what's going on here, but I need to know more.' And then you get more and maybe it's not that,\" she says. \"It felt like a fun ride to me.\"",
      "Part whodunit and part send-up of the LA scene, \"No Good Deed\" keeps viewers guessing about the hidden motives of all its characters right up until the very end. Even Kudrow and Romano were kept in the dark about the finale of \"No Good Deed\" until they were more than halfway through shooting the series.",
      "\"We didn't know,\" says Kudrow of the show's conclusion. That left it up to Romano to ask showrunner and creator Liz Feldman to reveal the ending.",
      "\"Around Episode Five, Ray went to Liz and just said, 'We're playing these people. The characters know exactly what happened, but we don't. So, don't you think we should know?'\" explains Kudrow, saying that the request prompted Feldman to wrap up the final details of the ending before sending it over to her lead actors.",
      "\"And then it was a big surprise,\" she says of finally learning the outcome of \"No Good Deed.\"",
      "Will 'No Good Deed' return for Season 2?",
      "After watching the finale, fans of the series may be wondering if there will be another season.",
      "According to Kudrow, Season Two of \"No Good Deed\" has yet to be decided. \"It's up to Netflix and Liz, what she wants to do with it next,\" says Kudrow. \"If she thinks it's worth it and there's room for me and Ray, I'm not saying no. I loved everybody. Luke was so great. Linda was great.\"",
      "As for what comes next, Kudrow says she wouldn't mind taking on a \"slice-of-life\" drama similar to \"Scenes from a Marriage\" or other dramatic role.",
      "\"Maybe a mystery,\" she says. \"But that's not apocalyptic or overly tragic.\""

      "Brianna LaPaglia, better known to her followers as Brianna Chickenfry, and her \u201cPlan Bri Uncut\u201d podcast co-host, Grace O\u2019Malley, are encountering some troubles in their longtime friendship.",
      "Throughout the past year, rumors have been flying that the best friends were no longer such. Now, each of them are speaking out to explain their sides of the story and how their friendship broke down. Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to LaPaglia and O\u2019Malley respectively for additional comment.",
      "Who are Brianna LaPaglia and Grace O\u2019Malley?",
      "LaPaglia, 25, and O\u2019Malley, 26, had been best friends growing up in Massachusetts and had together hosted the \u201cPlan Bri Uncut\u201d podcast under Barstool Sports.",
      "LaPaglia also co-hosts Barstool\u2019s \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast and spoke in a Dec. 11 episode about starting the \u201cPlan Bri\u201d podcast solo from her dorm room as a college advice show. When LaPaglia moved to New York to pursue the podcast with Barstool, she invited O\u2019Malley to move with her. O\u2019Malley eventually became co-host of \u201cPlan Bri\u201d and had been for the last two years, according to LaPaglia.",
      "LaPaglia had went through a public breakup with country music star Zach Bryan in the fall. In a Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia had reflected on the split and accused Bryan of \u201cnarcissistic, emotional abuse for a year.\u201d (Bryan has not responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims. He and LaPaglia did not return TODAY.com\u2019s requests for additional comment at the time.)",
      "As for O\u2019Malley, she is pursuing a career in comedy. She opened several shows for Whitney Cummings on her \u201cBig Baby Tour\u201d this fall. She\u2019s now on her own stand-up tour that goes into the spring.",
      "After her fallout with LaPaglia, O\u2019Malley said in a statement on her Instagram story Dec. 16 that she was parting ways with Barstool. On Dec. 19, O\u2019Malley and the Unwell Network, headed by podcaster (and former Barstool talent) Alex Cooper, said she was joining the Unwell family. They did not provide details about what that entails.",
      "When did Brianna Chickenfry and Grace O\u2019Malley\u2019s fallout happen?",
      "It\u2019s unclear when exactly O\u2019Malley and LaPaglia\u2019s friendship began to falter.",
      "However, fans began to speculate that something was amiss with the duo after O\u2019Malley celebrated her 26th birthday in October. She posted on Instagram a myriad of photos with friends, thanking them for celebrating with her.",
      "\u201ci had myself one of the best birthdays of all time,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cthank you so very kindly to all of you sweeties who reached out and showed out. much love xoxo.\u201d",
      "LaPaglia was not pictured in any of the photos. Plus, \u201cPlan Bri\u201d hadn\u2019t had a new episode since Oct. 10, leading fans to wonder if something was amiss.",
      "What has Brianna Chickenfry said?",
      "Some had speculated that LaPaglia\u2019s relationship with Bryan had caused a strain in hers with O\u2019Malley. When LaPaglia opened up about her breakup with Bryan on the Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d co-host Dave Portnoy asked LaPaglia how her friendship with O\u2019Malley was now that she and Bryan split.",
      "\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Grace will always be fine.\u201d",
      "Then in the Dec. 12 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia shared that she and O\u2019Malley were indeed on the outs and opened up about her side of the story.",
      "She said about a year and a half ago, the internet began pitting her and O\u2019Malley against each other. Then when she began dating Bryan, that relationship formed a \u201cwedge\u201d in her friendship with O\u2019Malley.",
      "\u201cBut she knew that this was the worst year of my life,\u201d LaPaglia said. \u201cThis is when the internet started attacking me. They only lift Grace up when they're beating me down. ... It was, like, whatever because it helped her career, and she was fine and happy about it. But it got to a point where she was, like, never defending me.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can hate (Bryan), but you can still be there for me,\u201d LaPaglia added. \u201cAnd she never was.\u201d",
      "LaPaglia claimed she went to O\u2019Malley in May and asked her to defend her online. She said O\u2019Malley responded by saying she knows the truth and that LaPaglia has supported her.",
      "\u201cOn top of everything that I was going through, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended our friendship \u2014 I was like, I have to take a step away from this because it was, like, months of me being like, Grace, can you just defend me?\u201d",
      "\u201cI needed her so bad, and I know she needed me too during that year. She felt like I left her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying these are two separate conversations,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryone's saying Grace deserves better, Grace lost her best friend. But I lost my best friend too. ... I brought her along for everything in my life. I gave her everything, and I would do it all over again. ... But when things get hard, and she knew what I was going through, I really needed her.\u201d",
      "She then commented on their work dynamic on \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do the podcast anymore because we\u2019re sitting there pretending to be friends. ... I needed to set a boundary \u2014 I can\u2019t continue this show anymore. So I ended the show.\u201d",
      "What has Grace O\u2019Malley said?",
      "O\u2019Malley hasn\u2019t responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims on the \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast about what she says led to their fallout. According to Portnoy, who\u2019s also the founder of Barstool, he asked O\u2019Malley to come on \u201cBFFs\u201d to explain her side of the story, but she declined.",
      "O\u2019Malley has, however, spoken out about \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "In early December, LaPaglia posted an Instagram story when \u201cPlan Bri\u201d made Spotify Wrapped\u2019s \u201cBreakout Creators of 2024\u201d list. She wrote: \u201cworking on bringing back some version of Planbri guys.\u201d",
      "This elicited a response from O\u2019Malley. She posted on her Instagram story Dec. 6 that she was unaware of LaPaglia\u2019s effort to bring back \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "She said:",
      "hi guys! if you know me you know i truly hate having to be serious about anything ever, but sometimes you just have to be. so, here it is (can you tell i\u2019m trying to stall even in this weird notes app post)",
      "for months i\u2019ve been radio silent about the status of plan bri and it has killed me to leave you guys hanging. the plan was for brianna and me to put out a joint statement about the end of the podcast.",
      "everything\u2019s so weird and unfamiliar at the moment so i\u2019ve just waited for the cue to put that out.",
      "seeing all of you tag us in your spotify wrapped made me feel a few things: proud of what we\u2019ve built, nostalgic for all these years, and frankly outright heartbroken that this chapter is closed. but, we agreed to make a joint statement, so i replied, cried, and chose not to repost or saying anything until it was time.",
      "on that same day, you may have seen brianna post that she\u2019s \u201cworking on bring back some version\u201d of plan bri. to give you guys the much needed info you deserve, all i can say is that that was my first time hearing about this.",
      "so, i feel as if it\u2019s only fair to share my piece about all this jazz with you now.",
      "my favorite part of this chapter of my life was not only all of you, but also getting to work with my best friend. it has truly been a dream job and i\u2019m eternally grateful to both brianna & barstool for giving me the opportunity to work on such a fantastic show with an even better team.",
      "this last year, i\u2019ve bit my tongue so much that i shouldn\u2019t have one anymore. i was willing to wait out of respect, but things don\u2019t always work out the way you think they will. in fact they rarely do. i most defiantly did not foresee any of this EVER ending.",
      "i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll ever fully get into every aspect of how this came to be, but it should be said that, although this was not a mutual decision, i\u2019m realizing that, in the grand scheme of things, it might actually end up being the right one.",
      "i really don\u2019t want to be the goofed up person who says things like \u201cstay tuned\u201d and \u201cbig things coming soon\u201d bc we all know i just mean i\u2019m working on creating another type of the same thing, but more me. thats kind of how it goes. i want you all to know that i\u2019m staying at barstool and, when it comes to chit chatting on a weekly basis, i\u2019ll be right back.",
      "i\u2019m always transparent and honest with you and ... honestly i have a pit in my stomach as i post this but hey ... that\u2019s showbiz baby!",
      "i love and adore you guys. see you soon xoxo",
      "Though she said in that statement on Dec. 6 that she was staying at Barstool, she then shared Dec. 16 on her Instagram story that she was parting with Barstool.",
      "\u201cI wanted you guys to hear it from me first that this is my last day at Barstool,\u201d she wrote in the post. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everyone at the company and to Dave for taking a chance on me. I\u2019m just as surprised as you are there are no typos in this statement.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 19, O\u2019Malley and the Unwell Network \u2014 home to Cooper\u2019s \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d Alix Earle\u2019s \u201cHot Mess\u201d and other podcasts \u2014 shared in a joint post on Instagram that she is joining Unwell in some capacity. Neither shared specifics about projects or what her role might be."

      "It was really important for Everett because he was really stuck in the past and he was stuck on his grief. He wasn\u2019t able to move on for a very long time. And the relationship with Mel was a point in which he was able to find a way to open up to her, find a way to move on from his grief and finish this beautiful song that he had written for her mother.",

I don\u2019t know if depth is the right word. But it\u2019s just like, \u201cWho would do that?\u201d There must be so much complexity going on behind his character for him to say that. It\u2019s really interesting. It was such a good scene.",
      "Doc\u2019s cliffhanger is really scary. The threat to the clinic is terrifying and I don\u2019t really know how we\u2019re going to approach that. I don\u2019t know if the birthing center is going to be affected by that. I would imagine it might not be because Mel\u2019s a midwife and I think she can still run the birthing center if a clinic closes. But I mean, you can\u2019t close the clinic.",
      "I\u2019m looking forward to watching how Lizzie (Sarah Dugdale) and Denny (Kai Bradbury) deal with being parents at such a young age. I live in the South and people get married here at like, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25 and they have kids. It\u2019s very common. I\u2019m personally very happy that I waited until I was 34 to have kids. But I see all these young mothers and they\u2019re just crushing it.",
      "The conversation between Mel and Doc at the hospital after Everett has a heart attack was particularly heart-wrenching, so that was a hard scene to shoot just on an emotional level.",
      "Season 7 of 'Virgin River'",
      "I hope to watch them explore becoming parents and what that looks like for them \u2014 the ups and downs of that journey. I found it to be a really interesting journey myself, becoming a parent. I hope that Mel starts cooking more and gets into farming a little bit. I like that for her. Maybe not so much riding the horse but like having a little garden, some chickens, a little kid running around.",
      "But I think that there\u2019s something about the storyline between Jack and Mel that\u2019s really intriguing. I definitely think that Martin and I had this electric chemistry we really stumbled into. We\u2019re so lucky that we had it because we didn\u2019t chemistry read or anything. We just both got cast and met and there it was. We just were really lucky.",
      "I could go on about it. I think there are a lot of different things at play as to why \"Virgin River\" has gone on. But it\u2019s gorgeous, it\u2019s comforting, people\u2019s storylines are personal and they touch upon things that people are going through. They inspire people. This is what I get from fans when they come up and talk to me about the show.",
      "I\u2019m a big fan of sci-fi, so I always want to be on the sci-fi show. I'm watching \"Silo\" and \"Dune\" right now and I can\u2019t wait to watch \"Dune\" later today because it comes out on Sundays. But there\u2019s nothing\u2019s inspiring me about \"Dune.\" But people get inspired by our show and I think that that\u2019s really special."

      "\u201cNo mail, low morale.\u201d",
      "That was the motto of the 6888th, a battalion that made history in World War II as the first and only Women\u2019s Army Corps unit of color to serve overseas.",
      "The heroic efforts of the battalion are captured in Netflix's \u201cThe Six Triple Eight,\u201d written and directed by Tyler Perry and starring Kerry Washington as the battalion\u2019s commander, Major Charity Adams.",
      "The 6888th was tasked with handling a backlog of over 17 million of pieces of mail, an especially important task at a time when letters were the only way soldiers could interact with loved ones.",
      "\u201cThey were inspiring the soldiers to keep fighting by getting them the letters from home,\u201d Perry said in the film's press notes. \u201cWhen that\u2019s the only way that you can communicate across seas in wartime, it was so important that those soldiers got those letters in their hands. That was life to them.\"",
      "Keep reading to learn more about \u201cThe Six Triple Eight\u201d and the real-life events that inspired the film, which premieres on Netflix Dec. 20.",
      "Who were the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The Six Triple Eight is a nickname for the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only U.S. Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC) unit of color stationed in Europe during World War II, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "The battalion of 855 women were mostly comprised of Black service members, but also included some women of Caribbean and Mexican descent.",
      "In February 1945, the 6888th was tasked with managing a backlog of over 17 million pieces of mail, sorting letters and packages that filled three aircraft hangars.",
      "It was a formidable job, especially given that so many letters were improperly addressed, or addressed to common names like \u201cRobert Smith,\u201d according to the Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee.",
      "The women devised an efficient system for sorting the mail and worked round-the-clock shifts in Birmingham, England. They had minimal heating despite freezing conditions and, due to the threat of air raids, they worked in aircraft hangars with blacked-out windows, making visibility difficult.",
      "In addition to the physical challenges, they faced racism and misogyny within the Army. According to the battalion\u2019s historical committee, they were not \u201callowed to sleep, shower or eat in the same facilities as the other female personnel and soldiers.\u201d",
      "The battalion was commanded by Maj. Charity Adams (later Lt. Col. Charity Adams Earley), the first Black woman to serve as an officer in the WAC. By the time the war ended, Adams was the highest-ranking Black woman in the U.S. Army.",
      "The 6888th battalion was given six months to complete their task, but they finished in 90 days. After they completed their mission in England, the battalion was relocated to France.",
      "How accurate is Tyler Perry\u2019s \u2018The Six Triple Eight\u2019 movie?",
      "The movie\u2019s protagonists are based on real people from the 6888th. Kerry Washington\u2019s character, Maj. Charity Adams, was based on the battalion\u2019s real-life leader.",
      "Several moments from the movie are taken directly from documented and real-life events. Washington tells TODAY.com that one of those real-life moments was when Adams was confronted by a superior officer who told her he would send a white officer to show her how to run her unit, to which Adams replied, \"Over my dead body.\"",
      "\"There are so many courageous moments that happened in the script that I then read in (Adams') memoir,\" Washington, who serves as an executive producer on the film, says. \"I think that was like a wonderful surprise to me, that we really were going to be presenting this story in a way that was so rooted in truth and in their lived experience.\"",
      "Washington also shares that similar to the film, Adams was \"threatened with being court-martialed.\"",
      "\"In real life, she was court-martialed,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"But because, as she says to the chaplain (in the film), 'I\u2019ve learned these laws and rules of the army inside and out,' she was able to win her court-martial, maintain her status and her position in the army. And she went on to earn multiple degrees on the GI Bill.\"",
      "Lena Derriecott King, played by Ebony Obsidian, was also a veteran of the battalion who helped Perry with his research.",
      "\u201cI met her when she was 99 years old. I didn't know what to expect,\" Perry told Hoda on TODAY Dec. 17. \"I wanted to ask her about the 6888 before I started writing. When she comes down the stairs -- comes down to sit and talk to me, I'm like, 'Is she going to be in the right mind? Is she OK?'\"",
      "Perry said his clear interaction with King quickly washed away all of his concerns. \"99 and sharp as a tack. She told me these incredible stories. Her recall and memory was so great that when I ran it by a historian, he was blown away that she could recall that much.\"",
      "Perry was able to show King a rough cut of the movie before she died at 100 in January 2024, and the filmmaker said she \u201cloved it.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was saluting the screen. She was laughing. But at the end of it, it was so powerful,\u201d he said, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum. \u201cShe was in tears. She just said, \u2018Thank you so much for letting the world know that we contributed.\u2019\u201d",
      "Several other characters in the film are based on real-life figures,  including Oprah Winfrey\u2019s character, civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune, as well as President Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, played by Sam Waterston and Susan Sarandon.",
      "While much of the film closely follows historical events, Perry revealed he did take one creative liberty toward the end of the film, when the entire battalion is applauded and saluted.",
      "\"That salute didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t happen until many, many, many years later,\" Perry told the audience at a recent screening of the film, attended by TODAY.com.",
      "\"So the liberty that I took at the end was having everyone of them be saluted,\" he continued. \"They all are saluted as they walk in because they represent all 855 to me. And you see them walking through this door into a new life, into a new future.\"",
      "What happened to the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The 6888th disbanded in 1946 and did not receive public recognition in the immediate aftermath of World War II.\u00a0According to Washington, there were even rumors when they returned home that they \"were only sent over to be concubines to the Black soldiers.\"",
      "\"This rumor got started to kind of diminish their legacy,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"So a lot of women when they came back, not only were they not celebrated, but they didn\u2019t talk about what they did.\"",
      "In recent years, however, the battalion\u2019s work has been honored on a national level. In 2018, a monument to the 6888th was erected in Leavenworth, Kansas, and in 2022, the battalion was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Six of the members from the battalion who were alive at the time received the honor.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. Army also changed the name of the Fort Lee Army base in Virginia to Fort Gregg-Adams, in honor of Lt. Col. Charity Adams and Lt. Gen. Arthur Gregg, the first Black officer in the U.S. Army to reach the rank of lieutenant general.",
      "As of 2024, there are two remaining members of the 6888th: Fannie McClendon and Anna Mae Robertson."

      "The victims were a 9-year-old boy and four women, ages 52, 45, 67 and 75.",
      "The attacker bypassed security bollards \u2014 set up to prevent such attacks \u2014 with\u00a0the rental\u00a0vehicle and entered the crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg through a gap meant for emergency vehicles,\u00a0Tom-Oliver Langhans, director of the Magdeburg police, said at a press conference Saturday.",
      "Once inside, the attacker\u00a0drove 1,200 feet at speed\u00a0into the narrow, crowded alley, knocking scores of people to the ground, authorities said. Forensic scientists\u00a0are probing whether\u00a0the attacker\u00a0had intentionally disabled the\u00a0car\u2019s\u00a0emergency braking system to maximize impact.",

      "Magdeburg police said investigations are ongoing and officers are appealing for witnesses to send in photos or video of the incident.",
      "At the press conference Saturday evening, officials revealed that the suspect had been questioned,\u00a0without revealing what he had said.",
      "Prosecutor Horst Walter Nopens said the motive is still being investigated but that \u201cthe background of the act\u201d could be linked to \u201cdissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany.\u201d",

      "What began as a tech mogul railing against political correctness in the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments on both sides of the Atlantic to reckon with Musk\u2019s growing political and cultural influence.",
      "Last week, Farage told the BBC that his Reform UK party was in \u201congoing negotiations\u201d with Musk after the pair met at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Musk, a South Africa-born U.S. citizen, is prohibited from making a personal donation to a British political party, but he could potentially contribute through the U.K. subsidiaries of his various companies, which reportedly made around \u00a390 million in profits over the past two years.",
      "\u201cHe wants to help us. He\u2019s not opposed to the idea of giving us money, provided we can do it legally through U.K. companies,\u201d Farage said.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Electoral Commission has said Prime Minister Keir Starmer must strengthen rules around political donations to protect its elections from foreign interference, according to the U.K.\u2019s Guardian newspaper.",
      "Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies.",
      "While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire\u2019s words carry weight well beyond the tech world.",
      "Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d and championing anti-immigration rhetoric.",
      "His transformation aligns with the resurgence of President-elect Donald Trump and the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France\u2019s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders.",
      "His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire\u2019s politics.",

Musk has accused Britain of being a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d amplified calls for a general election just months after Starmer became prime minister, and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist.",
      "Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe, Musk last week openly endorsed Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "The AfD\u2019s leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully\u00a0employing Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings.",

      "Meanwhile, behind the scenes,\u00a0he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications.",
      "Musk met directly with Xi at a 2023 dinner in San Francisco. His Tesla electric vehicles are largely\u00a0manufactured in China, including at its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",

Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d",
      "And in the U.S., Musk has already shown signs of his power over the political process, pushing the country\u2019s government to the brink of a shutdown after joining with Trump to effectively kill a congressional spending bill.",
      "While Musk\u2019s outsize role showed what he can achieve in Washington, his capacity to wield political influence may begin to stretch beyond U.S. borders."

      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",
      "He has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda.",

      "But with a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head and as the current leader of a group that has been designated a terrorist organization by Washington and others, he faces an uphill battle to convince people that he is a changed man.",
      "Sharaa has \u201cbeen embracing a more conventional image,\u201d Joze Pelayo, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told NBC News. \u201cBut I think he needs to walk the talk for that recognition and for that approval to remain sustainable.\u201d",
      "Sharaa has also attempted to present HTS as more moderate, insisting in his BBC interview that it should not be considered a terrorist group because it does not target civilians or civilian areas.",
      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sharaa also promised that a Syrian committee of legal experts would be formed to write a new constitution for the country. \u201cThey will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law,\u201d he said.",

And if he doesn\u2019t win in the elections, will he peacefully stand aside for whoever does win? I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now and certainly making clear that they want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they stand up interim governing authorities \u2014 making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing Tuesday.",
      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:10:14 GMT",
    "summary": "A landmark mass rape trial in France has exposed abuse orchestrated by the victim's husband, and a culture that many activists say is sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 When France\u2019s landmark mass rape trial began Sept. 2, the woman at its center appeared to shrink as she arrived at the stark courthouse in Avignon, her face hidden behind dark sunglasses and surrounded by a cordon of lawyers and loved ones.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, eventually found her voice, bringing into the light not only the inconceivable abuse orchestrated by her husband, who was on Thursday sentenced to 20 years for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious, but a culture that many activists have called sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
      "Another 46 other men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years.",
      "Many here say France will never be the same. How could it be, they ask, after so many supposedly ordinary men \u2014 among them a firefighter, a nurse, a journalist and a retired sports coach \u2014 were recorded committing unspeakable acts on a snoring grandmother.",
      "\u201cIt brings us back to the idea of who we are as a society, for normal men to commit acts that are totally transgressive and criminal,\u201d said feminist, lawyer and author Anne Bouillon. With domestic violence complaints in France doubling since 2016, she said, the Pelicot case highlights the fact that women are most at risk at home, threatened by partners.",
      "For Blandine Deverlanges, a high school teacher and founder of the feminist group Les Amazones d\u2019Avignon and a steady presence at the courthouse, the case has tapped a vein.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much larger than the issue of rape. It\u2019s a question of listening to what women have to say.\u201d",
      "Several feminists wondered whether France is in a second wave of the #MeToo movement, which rippled through the film industry here after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s takedown in 2017 but failed to land the same punch on a broader spectrum as in the United States and other countries. France has a history of defending bold-faced men who act badly, such as exiled film director Roman Polanski. Famous French women like the actress Catherine Deneuve didn\u2019t help the cause by signing a letter that denounced sexual \u201cpuritanism\u201d and defended\u00a0men\u2019s \u201cfreedom to pester\u201d women.",
      "But women say the climate feels different this time. Last week, in another closely watched trial seen as France\u2019s first major #MeToo case, Christophe Ruggia, a little-known film director, was charged with isolating and repeatedly sexually assaulting rising star Ad\u00e8le Haenel, beginning when she was 12 and he was 36.  Haenel, now 35, eventually left the industry and denounced adults who failed to help her. He denies the charges; a verdict is expected in February.",
      "With tempers running high over the Pelicot case, activists are hoping to mobilize that outrage into an effort not only to help victims of sexual assault, but also to transform a society in which 75% of women say they are not treated equally, according to a 2024 government study.",
      "\u201cIn France, we haven\u2019t paid much attention to sexual violence,\u201d said Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host who started the organization Femmes Avec to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault navigate the justice system.",
      "Last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the population of Lille,\u201d R\u00e9us noted, citing the city on the northern border with Belgium.",
      "Much of the discussion has focused on the wording of France\u2019s rape law, which some feminist lawyers say is vague, particularly in cases in which a victim is intoxicated or, like Pelicot, subjected to being drugged,\u00a0known as \u201cchemical submission.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted crushing large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into his wife\u2019s food and drink. She would discover the truth only in November 2020, weeks after police arrested her husband after he was caught recording up the skirts of women in a supermarket.",
      "Rape is defined under French law as an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d committed \u201cby violence, coercion, threat or surprise.\u201d Defense lawyers have insisted that their clients did not intend to commit rape because Dominique Pelicot invited them into the family home, and gave them careful instructions on what he wanted them to do to his wife.",
      "\u201cThis is not American law. In France, you don\u2019t need to have obtained the victim\u2019s consent necessarily to ensure that it\u2019s not rape,\u201d said lawyer Guillaume de Palma, who represents several of the defendants.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d",
      "She said most European countries have adapted their laws and procedures to streamline rape investigations and help victims.",
      "Lafourcade, a veteran magistrate with experience investigating sexual assault cases, was among 500 activists who signed an open letter calling for a consent provision to be added to the law.",
      "But other activists and lawyers say the law is sufficient, with consent implied. Anything more explicit, they say, would force the victim to prove a lack of consent.",
      "Opposing camps do agree on one point: France must overhaul a system that makes it difficult to report sexual violence. From making a police report to following up with a timely medical exam, they agree that it is often a luck of the draw whether a police officer will follow proper procedure or a hospital or an emergency room nurse will agree to take essential DNA samples.",
      "Aurore Hendrickx, 26, a Paris event planner, said she has a few friends who have been sexually assaulted and tried without success to file reports with the police.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, they were almost laughing at them,\u201d she said of the police response, adding that a stunning 90% of her friends have been sexually assaulted or raped. One friend was almost killed by a violent partner.",
      "If police give victims the brush-off, it is often no better at hospitals, where traumatized women are often turned away, advocates say.",
      "Filmmaker Linda Bendali, who has researched cases of chemical submission \u2014 sometimes called date rape \u2014 said a friend\u2019s 23-year-old daughter woke up naked in a strange man\u2019s bed last March with no idea how she got there. Her last memory was sipping a drink in a Paris bar.",
      "\u201cI called the hospital and told them they could see her now. They said, \u2018No, come back tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bendali said, fuming, adding that she \u201cpushed hard\u201d to demand they take timely blood and hair samples, essential to prove whether the victim had ingested drugs.",
      "While the victim is awaiting a court date, that is a rare occurrence. Only 6% of rape complaints are investigated in France. After that, a trial is conducted behind closed doors \u2014 a process that feminist historian Christelle Taraud called \u201ctruly horrible for the victim,\u201d who is often treated badly by the defense lawyers, with no public accountability.",
      "Taraud called it an \u201celectric shock\u201d when a judge reluctantly approved Pelicot\u2019s demand to keep her trial open, even when intimate videos of her were aired. Finally, Taraud said, the public got to hear and see evidence of the horrific violence inflicted on Pelicot, whose show of strength has made her an international icon.",
      "\u201cThey treated her like a piece of meat,\u201d Taraud said.",
      "In testimony that left many spectators speechless, some of the men appeared to be acting out porn film fantasies. One of them, a former firefighter busted with thousands of images of child pornography, gave a thumbs up to the camera during the assault.",
      "The defendants, who met Dominique Pelicot in a now-defunct online chat room called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d told the five-judge panel that they believed the prone woman was a willing participant. Though her lolling head would seem to indicate otherwise, they called the petite woman, often dressed in lingerie, a swinger acting out a \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d fantasy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Dominique Pelicot said at the start of the trial. Slumped in a glass box, he was separated from the other defendants.",
      "Dominique Pelicot\u2019s cache of 20,000 photos and videos included snaps of his daughter, Caroline Darian, naked in bed. While he has insisted that he did not abuse her, Darian, whose book, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again,\u201d will be published in English next month, told the court that she\u2019ll never know what really happened. \u201cDid he also drug me?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWorse still, did he abuse me?\u201d",
      "In her final statement to the court, Pelicot made it clear that she is hoping her humiliation won\u2019t be in vain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes,\u201d she said.",
      "The \u201cGis\u00e8le effect\u201d extends beyond Avignon, where the retired logistics manager is applauded and handed bouquets of flowers. Schoolgirls call her name. Strangers send gifts. In a phenomenon that must be deeply satisfying to the woman who wanted \u201cshame to change sides,\u201d activists say women who hadn\u2019t dared speak about domestic violence and sexual assault credit Pelicot with giving them courage to share their stories.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally because of Gis\u00e8le that I have the strength to talk about it,\u201d said Latika, 33, who is still recovering from trauma four years after divorcing a violent husband.",
      "The beatings she said she endured were only part of the story. Latika said she learned the man she met at age 17, the father of her children, had been feeding her drugs for years. Like Pelicot, there were signs something was off, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cOne night I didn\u2019t drink all of my tea,\u201d she said, and she awoke to find her husband raping her.",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate her allegations.",
      "Latika has found solace as part of an \u201cequine therapy\u201d program at Lucky Horse, a 25-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of Mount Ventoux in the picture-postcard village of Mazan, about a mile from the former Pelicot home.",
      "Marion Vogel opened the ranch with her husband, a psychotherapist who has worked with domestic violence survivors, to help women develop \u201clife skills\u201d by working with animals. They ride horses without saddles and stirrups \u201cto connect body to body.\u201d They learn to trust themselves.",
      "First up for Latika was overcoming her fear of horses. She spent half a year building up her confidence tending to an adorable Shetland pony before graduating up to Z\u00e9phyr, a sleek champagne quarter horse with a white slash between his eyes who is now her favorite.",
      "She brushes Z\u00e9phyr\u2019s silky mane and takes him for rides in the same lanes and fields where, Vogel noted, Pelicot used to take long walks.",
      "Like Pelicot, Vogel said, these women \u201call have something to fight for.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe must understand the perpetrator and his motives to respond with the necessary criminal and other consequences,\u201d he added.",

      "More notably, Musk joined Trump\u2019s pivotal first call after the election with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions with world leaders alongside Trump are raising questions about the tech leader\u2019s potential influence on U.S. foreign policy over the next four years and the potential for conflicts of interest, Washington insiders say. Musk maintains extensive worldwide investments, especially in China, America\u2019s most powerful adversary, and has openly supported far-right political movements around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on a level that is so foreign to me I can\u2019t get my head around it,\u201d a former national security official in President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet said. \u201cBeing in these meetings alone or with Trump, who knows what ethics violations are taking place.\u201d",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said \u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency. The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "Musk holds over $15 billion in federal contracts \u2014 principally through his SpaceX rocket company that NASA has come to rely on for aspects of its rocket program. The Pentagon depends on Musk for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite services, which are critical for U.S. military operations around the world.",
      "Behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Since 2014, Trump has traveled to China at least eight times where he had meetings with senior Chinese officials. In one meeting, he was even offered a Chinese green card by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk met directly with Xi at an exclusive 2023 dinner in San Francisco when he visited the U.S. for a daylong summit in 2023.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla electric vehicles, which account for almost 50% of all EV sales in the U.S., are largely manufactured in China, where the company opened its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",

Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d Especially troubling to some is Musk\u2019s prospective role recommending ambitious cuts in federal jobs. The former intelligence official added, \u201cWhen he\u2019s one of the arbiters of government efficiency, and how many thousands of people he can fire, he has all these government conflicts.\u201d",

This week, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is looking into whether Musk complied with disclosure rules for his top-secret security clearance requiring him to report meetings with foreign officials, citing unnamed sources.",
      "\u201cI think he has incredible conflicts,\u201d the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, told NBC News, adding, \u201cHis association with the president-elect has already profited him as far as his personal assets are concerned.\u201d",

      "Clearly eager to smooth over any friction in the transition, Blinken quickly added praise for his likely successor, veteran Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, whom Trump has announced as incoming national security adviser.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in close communication with the incoming administration,\u201d Blinken said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural on one level for them to have conversations, communications, and in some ways, it\u2019s helpful to us, because we want to make sure that, as I said, we are handing over the baton in a way that the next administration can come in and be running at full speed.\u201d",

      "For months, Musk has clashed with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling Britain a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d endorsing calls for a new election and boosting a video from a jailed far-right activist. In August, Musk stoked tensions there by saying the country was on the verge of civil war following days of far-right violence.",

      "In the last several days, consternation and excitement around Musk\u2019s potential influence under Trump reached a fever pitch after Musk initiated a movement that quickly torpedoed funding legislation supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "As some Republicans have celebrated Musk\u2019s successful effort to intervene, suggesting he should be made speaker of the House, many critics have raised concerns that Musk could be acting as a sort of \u201cshadow president\u201d or \u201cco-president\u201d to Trump."

      "Elon Musk waded into Germany\u2019s election on Friday, expressing his support for a far-right anti-immigrant and anti-Islam party that's being monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d the tech billionaire wrote on X, referring to the Alternative for Germany party.",
      "The German government declined to comment at its regular press conference on Friday.",
      "Europe\u2019s most populous country is expected to vote on Feb. 23. On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left coalition government collapsed after he\u00a0lost a confidence vote.",
      "It is only the sixth time such a vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe\u2019s largest economy. It was required because, in post-World War II\u00a0Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag, or parliament, to dissolve itself.",
      "Scholz expected to lose the vote, but had hoped that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP), which had formed a fractious coalition government with the pro-market Free Democrats and the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Before calling the vote, Scholz accused Christian Lindner, his finance minister and\u00a0Free Democrats member, of violating his trust after he publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon.",
      "While mainstream parties have traditionally boycotted the AfD, meaning they will not form governing coalitions with the movement, the party is running second in opinion polls, according to Reuters, and might be able to thwart either a center-right or center-left majority.",
      "Founded in April 2013 as a movement against the euro currency, the AfD has shifted its focus to combatting Islam and immigration and has grown in popularity at both local and national levels ever since, particularly in the former East Germany, which has lagged economically behind the west of the country.",
      "In September, it became the first far-right party to win the most votes in a state election since the Nazi era, when it triumphed in Thuringia.",
      "The win came despite a string of controversies linked to its leadership. The party is monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. Party leader Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. He has appealed the rulings.",
      "And in May the party\u2019s top candidate, Maximilian Krah, was forced to withdraw from campaigning after he told an Italian newspaper that the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d One of his aides was also charged with spying for China, and another candidate faced allegations of receiving bribes from a pro-Russian news portal.",
      "Musk also voiced support for the AfD last year when he criticized\u00a0 the German government over its handling\u00a0of illegal migration.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who has been tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with co-leading a commission called the Department of Government Efficiency, also called for the sacking of Italian judges who had questioned the legality of government measures to prevent irregular immigration.",
      "He has also clashed with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this year after he labeled Britain a \u201ctyrannical police state\u201d and endorsed calls for a new election."

    "title": "Manchester City was the most dominant team in world football. Now it can't win a game.",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:02:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Winners of six of the last seven English Premier League titles, Manchester City has just one win in their last 10 games in all competitions.",
    "story": [
      "Right now, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has the look of Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus when Rome fell in A.D. 476. He knows his masterpiece is falling, and he is powerless to stop it from crumbling.",
      "Last weekend, Manchester City conceded two late goals in the Manchester derby, or rivalry match, to lose to bitter rivals Manchester United 2-1. City fans inside their Etihad Stadium home sat in near silence. Nobody was angry. They\u2019ve witnessed greatness for almost a decade under Guardiola, but this silence was somber. Absolutely nobody saw this run of just one win in the last 12 games in all competitions coming.",
      "Manchester City has won six of the last seven English Premier League titles and eight of the last 13. It\u2019s a dynasty.",
      "A few months ago it became the only team in English soccer history to win four straight top flight titles. It won the treble (the Premier League, European Champions League and FA Cup trophies) the season before that, becoming just the second team in English history to do so. Everything was going historically well. What could possibly go wrong?",
      "Fast-forward a few months, and City is broken. Badly. It has lost six of its last eight Premier League games. It lost just 11 Premier League games in total over the previous three seasons combined.",
      "This feels like the beginning of the end of Guardiola\u2019s incredible reign as City\u2019s marauding, all-conquering emperor in the most competitive league on the planet.",
      "Can Manchester City snap out of this?",
      "Usually we\u2019d say yes. Given the quality of players it has, the depth of its squad and the manager, after a slow start to a season City usually improves in the second half and kicks on to win trophies.",
      "But this feels different. The current signs aren\u2019t good.",
      "City playmaker Bernardo Silva scolded his teammates for their decision-making late on in the shocking collapse against Manchester United last weekend.",
      "\u201cAt this level, if it\u2019s a game or two, you can say it\u2019s lucky or unlucky, but if it\u2019s 10 games, it is not about that,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of games lately. ... We have to look at ourselves. It\u2019s the decisions that you make. Today, the last minutes, we played like under 15s, and we paid the price.\u201d",
      "And that is the crux of this problem. Guardiola\u2019s \u201ctotal football\u201d philosophy relies on taking risks in possession, piling players forward to have a numerical advantage in the final third and keeping the ball and making good decisions. But what happens when you don\u2019t and you lose the ball?",
      "City always had Rodri, a defensive midfielder just voted the best player on the planet, to plug the gaps, cover cracks, win the ball back and be the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card.",
      "But Rodri went down with a season-ending knee injury in September against Arsenal. That\u2019s when this all started. Rodri\u2019s importance to City was clear, but nobody realized just how much of an impact his injury would have, simply because he has pretty much been ever-present since he arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2019.",
      "City has tried everything to replace Rodri over the last few months, but Guardiola, usually a genius in solving problems with creative solutions, has run out of ideas.",
      "City\u2019s only hope is to sign a sensationally talented defensive midfielder in the January transfer window to plug the Rodri gap. But that would really only paper over the cracks of an aging, injury-hit squad that has so many stars limping over the hill at the same time.",
      "Has a quick collapse like this happened before?",
      "We\u2019ve seen this happen before in European soccer.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s legendary side under Sir Alex Ferguson aged overnight and descended into chaos, and United haven\u2019t won a league title since he left in 2013. Barcelona\u2019s dream team was kept around too long and was left to crumble together as Lionel Messi kept waving his wand to make it seem like an illusion, until it fell apart. Chelsea\u2019s star core eroded quickly in 2011 aside from its sensational last hurrah in winning the Champions League in 2012. Real Madrid\u2019s famed Galacticos wilted in 2008 just as Barcelona\u2019s young stars emerged.",
      "The only saving grace for City is that there is no clear pretender to take its place as the top dog in English soccer. Yet.",
      "Liverpool is early in its new project under new manager Arne Slot. Arsenal appears to have taken a step back this season. Chelsea\u2019s talented young squad is a few years from realizing its potential. Manchester United is in a massive rebuild, again.",
      "Amid all of its struggles this season, City is still within touching distance of the title. But from defending better to finding a Rodri replacement to keeping star players fit, it has to knit it all back together at the same time. Now. There can be no more \"under 15s\" decision-making. This topsy-turvy Premier League season has given City a chance to salvage its season.",
      "Over the festive period, City can put itself back in the title race with a favorable schedule before it faces Chelsea and Arsenal in early 2025. If it can navigate the next month without a hiccup, and it still can, there\u2019s a chance City can get itself back in the title hunt. A small chance.",
      "What if Guardiola leaves and chaos ensues?",
      "There is, of course, the possibility that Guardiola, who only just signed a new contract that runs until the summer of 2027, could walk away this season.",
      "He isn\u2019t under pressure from the Abu Dhabi-based owners. Guardiola was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle when he arrived in 2016. He turned City\u2019s expensively assembled machine into a winning juggernaut while playing soccer in its most beautiful form. Even if City finishes outside the Premier League\u2019s top six this season, it will back Guardiola to rebuild the team and go again. If that is what he wants.",
      "But there is a lot going on at City right now.",
      "It has been charged with 115 breaches of Premier League rules, and that hearing has been going on over the last few months, all while City has been crumbling on the pitch. It\u2019s expected that a verdict will arrive soon.",
      "Guardiola has said multiple times he will stay if City is handed a hefty punishment or even relegated from the Premier League to the lower leagues of English soccer.",
      "But nobody ever factored in that City would be struggling to win a game and look such a mess and that Guardiola might not be good enough for the job. Not our words. His.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not good enough,\u201d Guardiola said after the defeat against Manchester United. \u201cI am the boss, the manager, I have to find solutions, and so far I haven\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far\u201d is the key phrase there, though. It suggests Guardiola, one of the greatest and most successful managers in the history of the game, still believes he can turn this around.",
      "But if this keeps on getting worse, Guardiola may decide to leave before his reputation is tarnished.",
      "City will then be in chaos, with no clear successor lined up and a squad of very talented players all recruited to play in a very specific Guardiola way. Plus, it could be looking for a new manager and rebuilding an aging squad all while uncertainty continues about its future because of those alleged breaches of Premier League rules.",
      "Amid this horrendous run of form for one of the greatest teams soccer has ever seen, there is a very real fear among Manchester City fans that things are about to get a lot worse. When a team starts to crumble like this, it happens very suddenly, and there isn\u2019t a quick fix.",
      "City\u2019s fan base has a notoriously downbeat outlook on the team, and that remains despite all the winning in recent years. But if Guardiola leaves and City\u2019s season descends into chaos on and off the pitch, the gallows humor its fans are famous for will intensify. And it might not mask the pain of what is about to come.",
      "The next few weeks are crucial on and off the pitch in determining how Guardiola\u2019s reign will come to an end. Whatever happens this season, he and City can say quite confidently \u201cveni, vidi, vici\u201d when all is said and done.",
      "For now, one of soccer\u2019s great dynasties is limping on."

      "A 2022 expedition to Peru\u2019s northwestern Alto Mayo region, which is heavily forested, saw the first documentation of at least 27 species that are new to science, according to a recent report in Conservation International\u2019s Rapid Assessment Program Bulletin of Biological Assessment.",
      "The haul of new species was also accompanied by another 48 species that are potentially new to science but require further analysis, the report said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the RAP team encountered exceptionally high levels of biodiversity that far exceeded expectations considering most of the study sites were located near communities and towns,\u201d the report said, adding that the findings \u201chighlight the importance of research and conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.\u201d",
      "In addition to the amphibious mouse and unusual-looking catfish, scientists discovered another type of mouse with stiff, spiny fur and a squirrel only distantly related to others known by science, as well as a new bat and several types of fish, butterflies and amphibians.",
      "While discovering new species of insects and even fish is not uncommon, the most significant takeaway from the report is the documentation of new mammals, said Chris Jiggins, an evolutionary biology professor at Britain's University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing \u2014 to find four new species of mammals unknown to science is pretty impressive. The amphibious mouse is something I\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d Jiggins told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 17:55:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Severe malaria is the likely cause of dozens of unexplained deaths and nearly 600 illnesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, health officials believe.",
    "story": [
      "Health officials are narrowing in on the cause of dozens of unexplained deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that a severe form of malaria is likely responsible, based on lab tests so far.",
      "The illness was considered a mystery for weeks. It has killed at least 37 people and sickened 592, according to the Africa CDC. Local authorities previously told Reuters that the death toll exceeded 140.",
      "Health officials in Africa have been referring to the illness as \u201cDisease X\u201d while awaiting test results.",
      "The Africa CDC said Thursday that lab tests of samples taken from 51 people suggest that a malaria outbreak may be behind the cases. Concurrent health issues among the population, such malnutrition and known viral infections, could exacerbate the illnesses. (Malaria is caused by a parasite that\u2019s spread by mosquitoes.)",
      "\u201cThe diagnosis is leaning more toward malaria,\u201d Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, principal adviser to the director-general of the Africa CDC, said at a news briefing.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry told Reuters this week that malaria was the culprit: \u201cThe mystery has finally been solved. It\u2019s a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,\u201d it said Tuesday in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "The ministry did not respond to multiple inquiries from NBC News.",
      "The World Health Organization said testing is ongoing and that it has not confirmed a diagnosis yet. The organization suggested Dec. 8 that malaria could be causing or contributing to the cases. Two days later, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 initial samples collected from sick people in the region had tested positive for malaria.",
      "Ngongo said in the Thursday briefing that the Africa CDC still has not ruled out a secondary hypothesis that some kind of viral infection \u2014 combined with malaria and malnutrition \u2014 is largely responsible for the illnesses. Ngongo said that one person who died experienced symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, a life-threatening condition associated with viral infections.",
      "The cases are in a rural part of Kwango province in southwestern Congo, which has limited access to laboratory testing and is difficult to reach by road, according to the WHO. The agency said it takes 48 hours to get to the province from the capital city, Kinshasa.",
      "Malnutrition rates in the province are high, the WHO added, which can make people more vulnerable to serious illness.",
      "Children, particularly those under 5, make up the majority of cases connected to the outbreak.",
      "The most commonly reported symptoms have been fever, headaches, coughing, difficulty breathing and anemia, according to the Africa CDC, with particularly severe symptoms among children.",
      "Malaria is the leading cause of death in Congo, resulting in more than 24,000 deaths each year. It also accounts for 19% of deaths among children under 5 in the country, according to the United States Agency for International Development.",
      "Malaria is caused by a parasite that Anopheles mosquitoes carry; it can spread to humans through bites. Mosquito nets, insect repellant and antimalarial drugs can help limit transmission, and receiving a malaria vaccine prior to infection can reduce the odds of severe disease and death.",
      "Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, said in a news briefing last week that the outbreak constituted a \u201cmajor public health issue,\u201d given how many cases had been reported in a short time.",
      "In a briefing Dec. 5, Kaseya noted that limited surveillance and laboratory resources had caused a five- to six-week delay in national health authorities being notified of the illnesses after patients first started experiencing symptoms.",
      "If malaria is the culprit, there may have been ways to rapidly detect it locally, said Amira Albert Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cHealth care providers could have detected it by taking small blood samples and looking at them under the microscope,\u201d Roess said. \u201cAll local clinics should have light microscopes and personnel who are trained to use them to detect malaria and other parasites.\u201d",
      "A local WHO team has been helping health authorities in Kwango province identify cases since the end of November. The U.S. CDC has also provided technical assistance.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry has issued a public statement instructing people not to handle the remains of anyone who died after experiencing flu-like symptoms without the involvement of authorized health authorities. The ministry also advised people to avoid mass gatherings and report any suspicious illnesses or unusual deaths."

      "Calling the terms far too lenient, Marion Vogel, who runs a therapy program for domestic violence and other trauma victims in Mazan, the village where the Pelicots lived, said, \u201cShame hasn\u2019t really changed camps to include the courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely essential for this high-profile trial to set an example and deliver deterrent sentences, so that every man\u2019s mind would be marked by it, and our society could finally evolve,\u201d she added.",
      "Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host whose organization, Femmes Avec, helps victims navigate the justice system, also said it was \"not a real punishment for most of these men.\u201d",
      "In an earlier hearing, it was revealed that Pelicot only learned of the horrors she endured when police started an investigation into her husband after a security guard caught him filming up the skirts of women with his smartphone.",
      "Investigators told they had found videos on her husband\u2019s devices that suggested she herself had been the victim of a major crime.",
      "While she could have remained anonymous, she called for the trial to be held in public and she instructed her lawyers to fight for harrowing video and other evidence to be played out in open court.",
      "She has previously said she was doing this in a bid to put an end to the \u201cmacho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape.\u201d",
      "Campaigners against sexual violence had been hopeful that Pelicot's case would represent a turning point in the fight against rape culture and in the difficulties that sexual assault survivors often face in obtaining justice.",
      "And in France, some of them told NBC News this week that they hoped to transform a society in which 75% of women said they believe they are not treated equally in a 2024 government study, and where last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the\u00a0National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d"

      "MOSCOW \u2014 The mother of U.S. journalist Austin Tice sent Russian President Vladimir Putin a letter late Wednesday asking for his help in finding her son, who went missing in Syria a dozen years ago.",
      "\"The current situation in Syria compels us to ask for your help in finding Austin and safely reuniting our family,\" Debra Tice wrote. \"You have profound connections with the Syrian government, which can be a great benefit for our unrelenting efforts to find our Austin and reunite our family.\"",
      "\"In this holiday season of peace and goodwill, we respectfully request your assistance in finding Austin and safely reuniting him with our family,\" she wrote.",
      "NBC News obtained a copy of the letter just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured Debra Tice that Israel would not conduct airstrikes near a secret prison outside Damascus where she believed her son may have been held.",
      "Putin is a longtime patron of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted earlier this month and fled the country to Russia. He and his late father ruled with an iron fist for half-a-century.",
      "Assad's sudden downfall raised the Tice family's hopes that the missing journalist might be in Mt. Qasioun prison, which is under a military museum and has a hidden tunnel that has not been fully explored.",
      "But Debra Tice said she's ready to reunite with her son wherever he may be.",
      "\"We would, of course, be willing to travel to Moscow or any place on earth to put our arms around our precious Austin and bring him safely home,\" she wrote.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Debra Tice said she had no misgivings about asking Putin for help.",
      "\u201cOf course I am reaching out to powerful people, so they can help us,\" she said. \"Russia has had a port there in Latakia forever, so I do think they have the ability\u00a0to know what\u2019s going on on the ground. We are still trying to find out where he is.\"",
      "Austin Tice disappeared in 2012, when he was in Syria reporting on the country\u2019s civil war.",
      "Shortly after he vanished, the State Department concluded\u00a0that he was being held by the hostile Syrian government, a charge that Assad\u00a0denied for years.",
      "Since the civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, hundreds of thousands of political prisoners disappeared into Assad\u2019s sprawling network of prisons and many were tortured and killed.",
      "Both Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have been accused by human rights groups of massacring and abusing their fellow Syrians.",
      "But after the\u00a0downfall of the Assad regime, thousands of prisoners who had been held captive for years have been released. But there still has been no sign of Tice.",
      "A former prisoner\u00a0told NBC News in the last few weeks that he was held captive in a cell across the hall from Tice and saw him alive as recently as July 2022.",
      "But while NBC News has not been able to independently confirm that account, Debra Tice said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cwe were able to verify that he was\u201d there in 2022."
