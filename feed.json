      "That\u2019s one of the big questions heading into the presentation of the Palme d\u2019Or on Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival. The past five winners in Cannes have all been released by the indie distributor, including last year\u2019s victor and eventual best-picture Oscar winner, \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Neon could make it six in a row, adding to its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\" and \u201cAnora.\u201d As far-fetched as that might sound, it might even be likely.",
      "Four of the most widely acclaimed film of the festival \u2014 Joachim Trier\u2019s family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\" Jafar Panahi\u2019s revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t\u201d \u2014 will be distributed in the U.S. by Neon.",
      "No one knows which way the nine-member jury headed by Juliette Binoche might vote. Their deliberations are done privately, and there are several other films seen as contenders. But critical reception is often a decent guide to what's in the mix at Cannes.",
      "Other films will strong support include Ukrainian filmmaker Sergei Logznitsa\u2019s period drama \u201cTwo Prosecutors\u201d; Richard Linklater\u2019s New Wave ode \u201cNouvelle Vague\u201d; and Spanish filmmaker Carla Sim\u00f3n\u2019s personal coastal tale \u201cRomeria.\"",

Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival.",

      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",

      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",

In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",
      "Julie Zito is a cancer survivor, Bill Zito lost his mother and sister to cancer, and the Zito family recently lost a close friend to cancer as well.

      "The team is hoping to raise at least $1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our families and all of our friendships,\" said Zito, who joined the Panthers in 2020. \"It makes me more determined not to achieve a goal for the goal\u2019s sake, but to achieve a goal to bring people together.\u201d",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban international students from Harvard would harm America's international standing, and one university in Hong Kong looked to capitalize on the uncertainty by promising to take them in.",
      "Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University\u2019s international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school\u2019s data, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",
      "It went on to say that it becomes necessary for international students to consider other options \u201cwhen policy uncertainty becomes the norm.\u201d",
      "Educational cooperation with the U.S. is mutually beneficial and China opposes its politicization, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",

      "She added that China would firmly protect the rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars abroad but she didn't offer any details on how it would do so in this situation.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology extended an open invitation to international students already at Harvard and those who have been admitted. The institution posted a news release saying it would provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition.",
      "Some people in China joked online about having the university open a branch in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, whose name shares the same character as Harvard\u2019s name in Chinese.",
      "The issue of Chinese students studying overseas has long been a point of tension in the relationship with the United States. During Trump\u2019s first term, China\u2019s Ministry of Education warned students about rising rejections rates and shorter terms for visas in the U.S.",
      "Last year, the Chinese foreign ministry protested that a number of Chinese students had been interrogated and sent home upon arrival at U.S. airports.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Shapiro cofounded Sound Talent Group in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen.

Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",
      "Shapiro was a strong advocate for independent musicians and a co-founder of the National Independent Talent Organization. He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",

You\u2019re not just showing up for the paycheck, it\u2019s not a 9-to-5,\u201d he said in a music industry podcast in 2021. \u201cThis is part of living your life if you really love it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",
      "In 2019, he posted on Instagram that he had obtained his airline transport pilot rating, the highest level of certification issued by the U.S.",
      "\u201cAlthough I have a career and don\u2019t plan to change that I always want to learn more and be a better pilot,' he wrote. He was also an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed base-jumping.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle a 48-year-old from Mississippi, appeared while in custody behind glass at a Hollywood courthouse that specializes in mental health cases. He had a long, gray beard and wore a thick, blue smock that jails use for suicide prevention.",
      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them.

      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

    "story": [
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",

      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",

We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said Wednesday that Cardi B will receive the Voice of the Culture Award. She'll be honored at ASCAP's invite-only event celebrating the top hip-hop, R&B and gospel songwriters on June 8 in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cBeing recognized for the impact my songs have had on the culture means everything to me,\u201d Cardi B said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted my platform and my music to stay true to who I am and inspire others to do the same, so this honor is especially meaningful.\u201d",
      "The Voice of the Culture Award is presented to ASCAP members who have had a major influence on music and culture, recognizing their success as creators and changemakers. Usher was the recipient of the honor last year.",
      "Cardi B made history in 2020 as the first woman to receive consecutive Rhythm & Soul Songwriter of the Year Awards. She's won 23 ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music awards.",
      "The hip-hop superstar is a Grammy winner whose \u201cInvasion of Privacy\u201d won best rap album in 2019. She's known for hits such as \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d \u201cI Like It\u201d and \u201cWAP.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",

      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",

      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",
      "KFF said the provision could affect 14 states and Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of their immigration status.",
      "This month the Democratic governor of one of them \u2014 California's Gavin Newsom \u2014 announced a plan to freeze new enrollments in state-funded health care for immigrants who do not have legal status as a budget-balancing measure.",
      "Planned Parenthood says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to about one-third of its health centers closing.",
      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",
      "Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening.",
      "Federal money was already barred from paying for abortion, but state Medicaid funds in some states now cover it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a fight for survival \u2014 not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,\u201d Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying \u201cCongress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.\u201d",
      "Medicaid would stop covering gender-affirming care for people of all ages in 2027 under a provision added in the hours before the bill passed.",
      "Further, coverage of the treatments could not be required on insurance plans sold through the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",

      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "\u201cI have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,\u201d Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, \u201cReal Coffee with Scott Adams. \u201cSo, I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\u201d",
      "He made the announcement after extending his \u201crespect and compassion and sympathy\u201d for Biden and his family. Biden announced his diagnosis on Sunday and said he and his family were reviewing treatment options with his doctors.",
      "Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer.",
      "\u201cIt's basically intolerable,\u201d he said of the pain.",
      "Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do.",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams.",
      "On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a \u201chate group\u201d and said he would no longer \u201chelp Black Americans.\u201d",
      "He later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.",
      "Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.",
      "The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped \u201cDilbert\u201d in 2022, said the comic strip \u201cwent from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.\u201d",

      "Nebraska is the first state to receive a federal waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the benefit program for low-income Americans long known as food stamps.",
      "The move, announced Monday by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, would affect about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps families pay for groceries.",
      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.\u201d",
      "Six other states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.",
      "The push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the SNAP program has been key focus of Rollins and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Rollins called Monday's move \u201ca historic step to Make America Healthy again.\u201d",
      "Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.",
      "The waiver \u201cignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches \u2014 not punitive restrictions \u2014 are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "SNAP is a roughly $100 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans and is run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and administered through states.",
      "The program is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used \u201cfor any food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for everything from bottled water and soda to chips, ice cream and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "Until now, USDA rejected the waivers, saying there were no clear standards to define certain foods as good or bad. In addition, the agency had said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly, and would not necessarily change recipients' food purchases or reduce health problems such as obesity.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",

      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- In many African cultures, a big belly has long been seen as a sign of wealth. But this perception is proving deadly as deaths due to obesity -related illnesses rise.",
      "In Kenya, overweight politicians are often called Boss or Mkubwa \u2014 Swahili for \u201cbig man\u201d \u2014 by constituents, with their girth symbolizing prosperity.",
      "Younger politicians, including the governors of Nairobi and Mombasa, have begun speaking publicly about weight loss. Obesity contributes to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, which have become Kenya's leading cause of death. The health ministry says they are responsible for 39% of fatalities annually.",
      "In a country where the government has said almost a third of the population is still unable to fulfill food needs, 13% adults are obese, according to the 2025 World Obesity Atlas. The contrast highlights the country's growing inequality and the popularity of fast and processed foods by those with rising incomes.",
      "Perceptions about obesity can affect financial and other decisions. In neighboring Uganda, microfinance institutions vetted loan applicants based on their weight, and those overweight were considered more able to repay loans, according to a study published by the American Economic Review in 2023.",
      "\u201cMost people feel like when I start making money, I have to look like the money itself by being fat or obese,\u201d said Kenyan nutritionist Felix Okoth. \u201cThey however don\u2019t realize that they are predisposing themselves to these lifestyle conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\u201d",
      "The World Health Organization's Africa director has called the rising trend a \u201cticking time bomb\" for the continent with the world's youngest and fastest growing population.",
      "Some are trying to change the conversation around weight. A former senator in Kenya, Cleophas Malala, has described how a 15-hour flight to the U.S. left him in pain and how doctors advised him to reduce.",
      "From a starting weight of 138 kilograms (304 pounds), he embarked on a non-solid diet for 90 days. Though he didn\u2019t disclose his current weight, before-and-after photos show him noticeably slimmer.",
      "\u201cMy colleagues in parliament were mad that I left the \u2018club\u2019 after I lost weight,\u201d the 39-year-old has said.",
      "Stephen Ogweno, who had childhood obesity and later became a public health advocate, said most Kenyan legislators don\u2019t see the issue as a problem.",
      "\u201cThese discussions are held in parliament where most MPs have big bellies, and so admitting that it concerns them, too, would be a good place to start,\u201d he said,",
      "Kenyan President William Ruto has spoken publicly about the need to be fit for work. He had to reassure Kenyans in 2023 that he was okay after online speculation about his health following weight loss.",
      "\u201cI decided to cut it down because the task ahead was not easy,\u201d he told journalists.",
      "Increasing incomes, proliferation of fast-food outlets in urban areas, sedentary lifestyles and lack of infrastructure that promotes physical activity have been named as probable causes of rising obesity in developing countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure that when we move away from lack of food, we are not going to the wrong food groups,\u201d said a Kampala-based doctor, Miriam Laker Oketta.",
      "Public health campaigns will help demystify the perception that weight is an indication of wealth, said Caroline Kirui, the Africa director for Project ECHO, an information-sharing platform for healthcare workers.",
      "Gyms, weight loss drugs and surgeries are being increasingly advertised in Kenya.",
      "But approaches such as the Ozempic weight-loss drug have left some users like Caroline Havi dissatisfied. She said she turned to a one-meal-a-day diet instead and hopes to eventually reduce her weight from 105 kilograms to 70 \u201cwithout spending so much.\"",
      "In South Africa, obesity-related deaths due to non-communicable diseases have surpassed HIV-related deaths, according to the WHO. The 2025 World Obesity Atlas said 32% of South Africa's adults are obese.",
      "The perception that weight is a symbol of wealth is slowly changing, said Rebone Ntsie, nutrition director at the National Department of Health.",
      "\u201cThere are those who still see it like that, but people are also seeing the dangers and its no longer celebrated as a sign of dignity, beauty, respect, social status,\" she said.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack early Saturday with explosions and machine gun fire heard throughout the city, forcing many Kyiv residents to take shelter in underground subway stations.",
      "The nighttime Russian attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an exchange that was agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday, acting head of Kyiv military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, wrote on Telegram. According to Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "Prior to the attack, city mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned Kyiv residents of more than 20 Russian strike drones heading towards Kyiv. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend that will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "As the freed men entered the medical facility Friday, people holding signs and photos of their relatives shouted names or brigade numbers, seeking any news of a loved one. The returning men inspected the photos, and a serviceman said he shared a cell with one of those on the sea of portraits held out toward him.",
      "\u201cVanya!\u201d cried Nataliia Mosych, among the gathered relatives, \u201cMy husband!\u201d",
      "The exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians at one time, didn\u2019t herald any halt in fighting.",
      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks to end the fighting as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday night that Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \u201csustainable, long-term, comprehensive\u201d peace agreement once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army\u2019s battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday.",

      "Margaret Satterthwaite, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, traveled the country meeting with judges, lawyers, lawmakers and others, including Guatemala\u2019s chief prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThe instrumental use of criminal law by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office appears to amount to a systematic pattern of intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights, targeted at specific groups,\u201d Satterthwaite wrote in her preliminary report. \u201cThis persecution appears to be intensifying, as those who have sought to end impunity and corruption, defend human rights, or speak out against abuses of power increasingly face digital harassment, threats, and criminal charges.\u201d",
      "The office is led by Consuelo Porras, who has been sanctioned by the United States and other countries and accused of being an obstacle to corruption investigations.",
      "Satterthwaite met with Porras and her staff. They told Satterthwaite that they acted within the law, denied using criminal law to pursue opponents and said they were the real victims of attacks by the executive branch and its allies, the U.N. expert said.",
      "\u201cCriminal charges have been directed at more than 60 justice operators and defense or human rights lawyers,\u201d Satterthwaite said, noting that more than 50 \u201cjustice operators\u201d have been forced into exile by the prosecutor\u2019s office.",
      "Porras\u2019 office said later that it did not agree with Satterthwaite's preliminary report, because it did not reflect \u201cthe complex work that we do, nor the exhaustive information that was provided.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe energetically reject the idea of a \u2018criminalization of sectors,'\" the office said. \u201cOur actions are based on serious, objective investigations that strictly adhere to the Guatemalan legal framework.\u201d",
      "President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo has tried unsuccessfully to convince Porras to step down. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Satterthwaite\u2019s observations.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa\u2019s top law enforcement official said Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that a video he showed in the Oval Office was of burial sites for more than 1,000 white farmers and he \u201ctwisted\u201d the facts to push a false narrative about mass killings of white people in his country.",
      "Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was talking about a video clip that was played during the meeting between Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday that showed an aerial view of a rural road with lines of white crosses erected on either side.",
      "\u201cNow this is very bad,\u201d Trump said as he referred to the clip that was part of a longer video that was played in the meeting. \u201cThese are burial sites, right here. Burial sites, over a thousand, of white farmers, and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.\"",
      "Mchunu said the crosses did not mark graves or burial sites, but were a temporary memorial put up in 2020 to protest the killings of all farmers across South Africa. They were put up during a funeral procession for a white couple who were killed in a robbery on their farm, Mchunu said.",
      "A son of the couple who were killed and a local community member who took part in the procession also said the crosses do not represent burial sites and were taken down after the protest.",
      "South Africa struggles with extremely high levels of violent crime, although farm killings make up a small percentage of the country's overall homicides. Both white and Black farmers are attacked, and sometimes killed, and the government has condemned the violence against both groups.",
      "Whites make up around 7% of South Africa's 62 million people but generally still have a much better standard of living than the Black majority more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of racial segregation. Whites make up the majority of the country's wealthier commercial farmers.",
      "Mchunu said Trump's false claims that the crosses represented more than 1,000 burial sites was part of his \u201cgenocide story\u201d \u2014 referring to the U.S. president\u2019s baseless allegations in recent weeks that there is a widespread campaign in South Africa to kill white farmers and take their land that he has said amounts to a genocide.",
      "\u201cThey are not graves. They don\u2019t represent graves,\u201d Mchunu said regarding the video that has become prominent on social media since it was shown in the White House. \u201cAnd it was unfortunate that those facts got twisted to fit a false narrative about crime in South Africa.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have respect for the president of the United States,\u201d Mchunu added. \u201cBut we have no respect for his genocide story whatsoever.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the South African official\u2019s remarks.",
      "Of the more than 5,700 homicides in South Africa from January through March, six occurred on farms and, of those, one victim was white, said Mchunu. \u201cIn principle, we do not categorize people by race, but in the context of claims of genocide of white people, we need to unpack the killings in this category,\u201d he said.",
      "Lourens Bosman, who is a former lawmaker in the national Parliament, said he took part in the procession shown in the video the Trump administration played. It happened near the town of Newcastle in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal in September 2020. The crosses were symbols to white and Black farmers and farmworkers who had been killed across South Africa over the previous 26 years, Bosman said.",
      "Trump's falsehoods that South Africa's government is fueling the persecution and killing of its minority white farmers has been strongly denied by the country, which says the allegations are rooted in misinformation.",
      "Ramaphosa pushed for this week's meeting with Trump in what he said was an attempt to change Trump's mind over South Africa and correct misconceptions about the country to rebuild ties.",
      "Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 that cut all U.S. financial assistance to South Africa and accused it of mistreating white Afrikaner farmers and seizing their land. The order accused Ramaphosa's government of \"fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.\"",
      "Trump's executive order also accused South Africa of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy and specifically criticized its decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The order accused South Africa of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas through that case.",

      "\u201cThe road to membership is not easy, so my message today is to stay on the course and to take next steps necessary towards the opening of the negotiations,\" Kallas said. \u201cNorth Macedonia faces era-defining choices for its citizens and its future.\u201d",
      "Key among those steps is a constitutional amendment to formally recognize a Bulgarian minority \u2014 a condition set by EU neighbor Bulgaria to lift its veto of North Macedonian membership. The issue has become a political flashpoint in North Macedonia, where the conservative government insists that EU accession should not be affected by bilateral disputes.",
      "Although the European Union has not accepted any new members since Croatia's accession in 2013, the war in Ukraine and concerns for broader European stability have refocused efforts to advance membership bids.",

      "North Macedonia and Albania began membership talks with the EU in 2022 after years of delays, largely driven by Bulgaria\u2019s veto over cultural and historical disagreements with Skopje. Albania has since moved ahead in the process.",

      "The protesters gathered outside the Serbian government building in downtown Belgrade demanding that the authorities revoke measures brought so far against protesting university professors and deans, and abolish plans to change education laws they say would scrap the autonomy of the state-run universities.",
      "University students, backed by their professors, have led massive protests that started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in Serbia's north in November, killing 16 people. Many in Serbia blamed the tragedy on alleged widespread government corruption that they say fueled negligence and flawed work on the station building renovation.",
      "The populist government of President Aleksandar Vucic has accused the students and university professors of allegedly working for unspecified Western powers to oust the government and \u201cdestroy\u201d Serbia.

      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- An Orthodox Christian monk was hospitalized following a violent confrontation at a monastic sanctuary in northern Greece, authorities said Friday. The incident is tied to a decades-old religious dispute.",
      "Hospital officials said the monk is being treated in Thessaloniki for cuts and bruises to his face and upper body, after being transferred from Mount Athos, located about 175 kilometers (110 miles) to the east.",

      "At the center of the ongoing conflict is Esphigmenou Monastery, whose brotherhood continues to defy court and church orders to vacate the premises. They refuse to recognize authority over them by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the spiritual home of the Eastern Orthodox Church based in Istanbul, Turkey.",
      "This religious rift has led to repeated violent clashes, legal battles, and supply blockades between members of the defiant brotherhood and church-appointed replacements. The controversy, which began in the early 1970s, was compounded by court decisions against the rebel monks, who are sustained by donations from outside groups of supporters.",

      "Human rights organizations, politicians and experts have sharply criticized a law approved by El Salvador\u2019s Congress this week that seeks to limit foreign influence and corruption",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Human rights organizations, politicians and experts have sharply criticized a law approved by El Salvador's Congress as a censorship tool designed to silence and criminalize dissent in the Central American nation by targeting nongovernmental organizations that have long been critical of President Nayib Bukele.",
      "The law proposed by Bukele was passed Tuesday night by a Congress under firm control of his New Ideas party, and bypassed normal legislative procedures. Bukele first tried to introduce a similar law in 2021, but after strong international backlash it was never brought for a vote by the full Congress.",
      "Bukele said the law is intended to limit foreign influence and corruption. It comes after the government took a number of steps that have fueled concerns that the country may be entering a new wave of crackdowns. Critics warn that it falls in line with measures passed by autocratic governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China.",
      "Here are more details about the root of the criticism:",
      "Anyone \u2014 individual or organization, local or foreign \u2014 who acts in the interest of a foreign entity or receives foreign funding to operate in El Salvador is required to register under the law. Every payment, whether in cash, goods, or services, made to such groups will be subject to a 30% tax. The final law passed does not specify how the money from the tax will be used.",
      "While the United States also has a law that requires individuals working on behalf of foreign entities and governments to register, Bukele's is far broader in scope and grants him greater powers. It is fairly common in poorer countries in Latin America to depend on international aid dollars, as it\u2019s often difficult to raise money in their own countries.",
      "Analysts say a broad definition of a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in the law could cover:",
      "\u2014 Human rights organizations",
      "\u2014 Community associations",
      "\u2014 Independent media outlets",
      "\u2014 Foreign-funded startups or businesses",
      "\u2014 Religious groups",
      "\u2014 International aid agencies",
      "The law creates a new government body called RAEX, or Registry of Foreign Agents, which will have wide powers, including setting requirements for registration, approving or denying applications, revoking or refusing to renew registrations and to demand documents or information at any time.",
      "Some NGOs can apply for exceptions, but RAEX will decide who can operate in the country. Around 8,000 NGOs operate in El Salvador and often depend on foreign donations due to lack of funds available in the Central American nation.",
      "Some of those groups have long been at odds with Bukele and have criticized some of his actions, including waiving key constitutional rights to crack down on the country's gangs and seeking reelection despite clear constitutional prohibitions.",
      "The rules NGOs will have to follow:",
      "\u2014 They must register with RAEX and report the source and purpose of all donations.",
      "\u2014 They must keep complete accounting records, use the banks for transactions and follow anti-money laundering laws.",
      "\u2014 They cannot operate without registering.",
      "\u2014 They cannot engage in political activities or actions seen as threatening public order or national security.",
      "\u2014 They cannot use foreign donations for undeclared activities or share information on behalf of foreign donors without labeling it as such.",
      "Violations of the rules can lead to fines between $100,000 to $250,000, and possible closure.",
      "Critics say Bukele revived the law because he has now consolidated power across all branches of government. His political alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump has emboldened him.",
      "Bukele announced the law shortly after a protest near his home ended in a violent crackdown by police and two people being arrested.",
      "It comes after a number of moves by Bukele that have raised concerns that the self-described \u201cworld's coolest dictator\u201d is cracking down on dissent.",
      "\u2014 Just two days before the law passed, the government arrested an anti-corruption lawyer with the human rights organization Cristosal \u2013 one of Bukele's most outspoken critics \u2013 on corruption charges.",
      "\u2014 The government arrested the heads of bus companies for defying an order from Bukele posted on his social media.",
      "\u2014 Journalists with the investigative news organization El Faro said they had to flee the country after receiving word the government was preparing orders for their arrest after they published reports on the president's links to gangs.",
      "\u2014 Opposition lawmaker Claudia Ortiz called the law \u201can authoritarian tool for censorship\u201c and said it hands the president excessive levels of control. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that exemptions will only be given to groups that align with the government, while those who expose corruption or abuse will be punished,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2014 Lawyer Roxana Cardona of the NGO Justicia Social y Controlar\u00eda Ciudadana said: \u201cThe Foreign Agents Law seeks to suppress organizations that promote civic participation or support marginalized groups the state ignores.\u201d",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- As Venezuelans head to a Sunday election, they are again being used as political pawns. Opposition factions are urging abstention while the ruling party aims to tighten its grip on power \u2014 all while both sides appeal to the U.S. government for decisions that would have a greater impact on people\u2019s lives than the vote\u2019s results.",
      "The election for members of the National Assembly, governors and other regional offices will be the first to allow broad voter participation since last year\u2019s presidential contest, which President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "The contest comes as the opposition\u2019s most recognizable figure, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, remains in hiding to avoid arrest and most other leaders are in exile or prison due to the government's repressive measures unleashed after the July election.",
      "\u201cWe lost confidence in voting. On July 28, they made fun of us,\u201d said Carmen Medina, who sells plastic jewelry in the capital, Caracas. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to vote.\u201d",
      "A nationwide poll conducted between April 29 and May 4 by the Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed that only 15.9% of voters expressed a high probability of voting Sunday. Of those, 74.2% said they would vote for the candidates of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela and its allies, while 13.8% said they would vote for contenders associated with two opposition leaders who ignored Machado\u2019s call to boycott the elections.",
      "Sociologist Roberto Brice\u00f1o, director of the independent Laboratory of Social Sciences research group, said many Venezuelans no longer see their vote as a tool to \u201cgenerate change or improve the country\u2019s dire situation.\u201d After July\u2019s election, he said, people are living with a \u201cpersistent sadness about the future\u201d as \u201cthey feel they did their part\u201d to get someone other than Maduro elected.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s most recent economic troubles pushed year-over-year inflation in April to 172%, bringing the price of food and other basic goods for a family to $409 a month, according to a group of economists. Meanwhile, the value of the monthly minimum wage, paid to state employees in Venezuelan bolivares, dropped to $1.36, which they supplement with a roughly $100 monthly government bonus and second or third jobs.",
      "The latest chapter in the 12-year crisis even prompted Maduro to declare an \u201ceconomic emergency\u201d last month.",
      "At the heart of the recent challenges of the oil-dependent economy is the status of a U.S. government-issued permit that determines the activities of energy giant Chevron Corp. in Venezuela.",
      "The company has become responsible over the past two years for about 20% of Venezuela\u2019s oil production and a regular infusion of U.S. dollars that ultimately helped the government maintain an artificially low currency exchange rate. That rate is crucial to Venezuelans as it determines the prices of food, goods and services.",
      "Chevron\u2019s permit, formally known as a general license, was granted by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. But under Donald Trump, the White House rescinded it in February, giving Chevron time to wind down its operations in the South American country and meeting one of Machado's appeals.",
      "The U.S.'s decision to either stick to the rescission, or fulfill Maduro\u2019s wish to extend Chevron\u2019s wind-down period beyond its May 27 expiration date, will have a greater, more immediate effect on Venezuelans than the result of Sunday's poll.",
      "That is because Maduro\u2019s government controls seemingly every aspect of the country, including health and social services, utilities and education. It also deploys its repressive apparatus against opponents by, for instance, disqualifying a candidate after the election or appointing a ruling-party loyalist to oversee the elected offices held by opposition members, rendering them powerless.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Machado supporter, on Wednesday posted on X that Chevron's oil license will expire as scheduled, contradicting statements from Trump\u2019s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, who after meeting with Maduro\u2019s negotiators Tuesday said it would be extended by 60 days.",
      "Asked for clarity on Rubio and Grenell\u2019s differing positions, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said \u201cSecretary Rubio, as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, is representing the Administration\u2019s position.\u201d",
      "The ruling party-loyal National Electoral Council will oversee Sunday\u2019s election for state legislators, 285 members of the unicameral National Assembly and all 24 governors, including the newly created governorship purportedly established to administer Essequibo, a region long under dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.",
      "Earlier this month, the Electoral Council moved to remove the QR code that previously appeared on the tally sheets that every electronic voting machine used in an election printed after polls closed. The tally sheets are considered the ultimate proof of election results, and their QR codes were used by Machado\u2019s team to show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez defeated Maduro by a more than 2-to-1 margin in July.",
      "Some opposition factions, including Machado\u2019s, are using social media to urge people to not vote Sunday, arguing that casting votes legitimizes Maduro\u2019s government. But voters have grown accustomed to opposition leaders promoting boycotts on and off for years without delivering the promised change.",
      "The strategy is destined to fail again without unanimity.",
      "\u201cThe government has co-opted some opposition (parties) and there\u2019s other opposition that are just tired of this strategy that\u2019s never worked,\u201d said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for 30 years. \u201cSo, what you are going to have is a partial boycott, which means the government is going to cruise to victory and can say, \u2018We had elections, the opposition didn\u2019t participate.'

    "story": [
      "The British government has signed a deal to transfer the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius",
      "LONDON -- Bernadette Dugasse was just a toddler when her family was forced to leave her birthplace. She didn\u2019t get a chance to return until she was a grandmother.",
      "Dugasse, 68, has spent most of her life in the Seychelles and the U.K., wondering what it would be like to set foot on the tropical island of Diego Garcia, part of the remote cluster of atolls in the middle of the Indian Ocean called the Chagos Islands.",
      "Like hundreds of others native to the islands, Dugasse was kicked out of her homeland more than half a century ago when the British and U.S. governments decided to build an important military base there.",
      "After years of fighting for the right to go home, Dugasse and other displaced islanders watched in despair Thursday as the U.K. government announced it was formally transferring the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius.",
      "While political leaders spoke about international security and geopolitics, the deal meant only one thing for Chagossians: That the prospect of ever going back to live in their homeland now seems more out of reach than ever.",
      "\u201cWe are the natives. We belong there,\u201d said Dugasse, who has reluctantly settled in Crawley, a town south of London. \u201cIt made me feel enraged because I want to go home.\u201d",
      "Dugasse was born on the Chagos Islands, which had been under the administration of Mauritius, a former British colony, until 1965, when Britain split them away from Mauritius.",
      "Mauritius gained independence in 1968, but the Chagos remained under British control and were named the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "Dugasse was barely 2 years old when her family was deported to the Seychelles in 1958 after her father, a laborer, allegedly broke a work contract. They were never allowed back. Throughout the 1960s, many other islanders who thought they were leaving temporarily \u2013 for a holiday, or medical treatment -- would be told they cannot return to the Chagos.",
      "It turned out that Britain was evicting the entire population of the Chago Islands -- about 1,500 people descended from African slaves and plantation workers \u2013- so the U.S. military could build a base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "By 1973, all Indigenous Chagossians were forced to leave. Thousands of islanders and their descendants are now spread around the world, most living in Mauritius, the U.K. and Seychelles. Most want to return home.",
      "Britain\u2019s government has acknowledged that its removal of islanders was wrong, and has granted many citizenship and set aside some funds to improve their lives. But it continues to bar Chagossians from returning and living in their homeland, citing defense and security concerns and \u201ccost to the British taxpayer.\u201d",
      "Although the British government this week finalized a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos to Mauritius, ending a long contested colonial legacy, there is no upside for Chagossians.",
      "Dugasse and other islanders say they were completely excluded from political negotiations, and that Mauritius\u2019 government is unlikely to grant them any right to return. Under the deal, which still needs Parliament's approval, Britain will lease back the Diego Garcia military base for at least 99 years. That means the island will be off-limits for the foreseeable feature.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a Mauritian passport. I don\u2019t want to affiliate myself with Mauritius,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our own culture. We have our own identity. We are unique Indigenous people.\u201d",
      "Dugasse and another Diego Garcia native, Bertrice Pompe, sought to bring legal action against the British government over the deal to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritian control. They only managed to halt the signing of the deal by a few hours Thursday.",
      "Pompe said it was a \u201cvery sad day\u201d but she wasn\u2019t giving up.",
      "\u201cThe rights we\u2019re asking for now, we\u2019ve been fighting for for 60 years,\u201d Pompe said outside a London courthouse. \u201cMauritius is not going to give that to us. So we need to keep fighting with the British government to listen to us.\u201d",
      "Human Rights Watch and other groups have urged Britain\u2019s government to recognize the Chagossians\u2019 right to return home, calling its failure to do so a \u201ccontinuing colonial crime against humanity.\"",
      "Dugasse \u2014 who received British citizenship but said she got no other compensation \u2014 has been allowed back to Diego Garcia just twice in recent years. Both times the visits were only possible with special permission from the U.K. government.",
      "She described the island as a \u201cmini-America,\u201d populated by American service members and Filipino staffers. She visited the church where her parents were married and where she was baptized, but found her village cemetery and school in ruins.",
      "And when she collected seashells and white sand from the beach, officials told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring those home.",
      "\u201cI told them no \u2014 (the shells and the sand) are mine, not yours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were allowed there for only nine days, and every day I cried.\u201d",
      "Dugasse said her elderly mother, who lives in the Seychelles, would like to die on Diego Garcia. She doesn't think that's possible \u2014 and she is pessimistic that any of her children or grandchildren will get a chance to see where their family came from.",
      "\u201cAre we Chagossians always going to be nomads, going from place to place?\" she asked. \"Most of the natives are dying. What will happen? It\u2019s time for us to set foot home.\u201d",

      "ISTANBUL -- Prosecutors in Turkey issued arrest warrants for 63 active-duty military personnel Friday over links to a group accused of attempting a coup in 2016.",
      "Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said the suspects included four colonels and came from the army, navy, air force and gendarmerie. Early morning raids across the country resulted in 56 suspects being detained.",
      "They are allegedly tied to an outlawed group that Turkey refers to as the Fethullahist Terror Organization, or FETO. Its leader, Fethullah Gulen, died in October last year in the United States, where he had lived since 1999 in self-imposed exile.",
      "Some 290 people were killed in July 2016 when rogue military units took to the streets of Ankara and Istanbul in a bid to depose the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Jet fighters bombed the parliament building and presidential palace while Erdogan narrowly escaped assassination or capture while vacationing on the west coast.",
      "A subsequent purge of the military, police, judiciary and other state agencies saw tens of thousands arrested. Schools, businesses and media organizations tied to Gulen were closed down.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s statement said those targeted Friday were identified through telephone communications and said FETO still posed the \u201cgreatest threat to the constitutional order and survival of the state.\u201d Since the failed coup, 25,801 military suspects have been detained, it added.",
      "The statement did not specify the exact charges against the suspects.",
      "Gulen, a former cleric, amassed a worldwide following over decades and aided Erdogan\u2019s rise to power in 2003. The alliance broke down after the government closed some Gulen-run educational establishments and Gulenists in the police and judiciary pursued corruption allegations against Erdogan\u2019s government.",
      "Gulen always denied any involvement in the failed coup. He was wanted in Turkey, which repeatedly demanded his extradition from the U.S.",
      "The coup attempt contributed to the acceleration of authoritarian tendencies in Turkey, with Erdogan\u2019s government implementing measures that consolidated his powers.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran and the United States prepared for a fifth round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program Friday in Rome, with enrichment emerging as the key issue.",
      "U.S. officials from President Donald Trump down insist Iran cannot continue to enrich uranium at all in any deal that could see sanctions lifted on Tehran's struggling economy. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi early Friday insisted online that no enrichment would mean \u201cwe do NOT have a deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cFiguring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,\u201d Araghchi wrote on the social platform X. \u201cTime to decide.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will be again represented in the talks by Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Michael Anton, the State Department\u2019s policy planning director. While authorities haven\u2019t offered a location for the talks, another round in Italy\u2019s capital took place at the Omani Embassy there. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi is mediating the negotiations as the sultanate on the Arabian Peninsula has been a trusted interlocutor by both Tehran and Washington in the talks.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic, closing in on half a century of enmity.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Enrichment remains the key point of contention. Witkoff at one point suggested Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later began saying all Iranian enrichment must stop. That position on the American side has hardened over time.",
      "Asked about the negotiations, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said \u201cwe believe that we are going to succeed\u201d in the talks and on Washington's push for no enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians are at that table, so they also understand what our position is, and they continue to go,\" Bruce said Thursday.",
      "One idea floated so far that might allow Iran to stop enrichment in the Islamic Republic but maintain a supply of uranium could be a consortium in the Mideast backed by regional countries and the U.S. However, Iran's Foreign Ministry has maintained enrichment must continue within the country's borders and a similar fuel-swap proposal failed to gain traction in negotiations in 2010.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel has threatened to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on their own if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Araghchi warned Thursday that Iran would take \u201cspecial measures\u201d to defend its nuclear facilities if Israel continues to threaten them, while also warning the U.S. it would view it as being complicit in any Israeli attack. Authorities allowed a group of Iranian students to form a human chain Thursday at its underground enrichment site at Fordo, an area with incredibly tight security built into a mountain to defend against possible airstrikes.",
      "Yet despite the tough talk from Iran, the Islamic Republic needs a deal. Its internal politics are inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past.",
      "Iran\u2019s rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar in April. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue as a further collapse in the rial could spark further economic unrest.",
      "Meanwhile, its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d sits in tatters after Iran's regional allies in the region have faced repeated attacks by Israel during its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government during a rebel advance in December also stripped Iran of a key ally.",
      "The Trump administration also has continued to levy new sanctions on Iran, including this week, which saw the U.S. specifically target any sale of sodium perchlorate to the Islamic Republic. Iran reportedly received that chemical in shipments from China at its Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. A major, unexplained explosion there killed dozens and wounded over 1,000 others in April during one round of the talks.",

      "In New Zealand\u2019s Parliament, every legislator has the chance to advance a proposed law, no matter how unpopular, thanks to an unusual lottery where bills are selected by random draw from a cookie tin",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Under the scrutiny of a black-robed official and before a hushed audience, a decorative cookie tin rattles like a bingo drum. Inside: the future of New Zealand \u2019s laws.",
      "The ceremonial lottery at Parliament, where bills are drawn randomly from what\u2019s known as \u201cthe biscuit tin\u201d in local parlance, is a way to ensure every New Zealand legislator has the chance to advance a proposed law, no matter how unpopular their bid. When a rare empty slot opens on Parliament\u2019s agenda, the battered metal cookie tin is produced from a glass case and its solemn and silly rite is hastily arranged.",
      "Inside the faded vessel with a peeling label might be an ambitious social initiative considered too risky for partisan support, a sensible but dull measure to tweak a statute, or a lawmaker\u2019s controversial hobby horse that their party wishes they\u2019d stop talking about. The tin doesn\u2019t judge.",
      "The quaintly patterned container, bought from a Wellington department store by a Parliament staffer in the early 1990s, might seem like a gag but the ritual selection of bills from it is a serious affair. Where decisions governing which bills are debated by legislators in Parliament are often determined by backroom brokering and subject to political gatekeeping, the cookie tin strikes an egalitarian note.",
      "\u201cWe ate the biscuits, got some bingo tokens numbered one through to 90, I think, and that is the way that the random numbers are drawn now, rather than any kind of computer system,\u201d said David Wilson, the Clerk of New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives. \u201cWhich has become quite an iconic part of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Most laws that pass through New Zealand\u2019s Parliament need never enter the ballot. They\u2019re part of the government\u2019s legislative agenda, advanced by senior legislators from ruling parties who already know their proposals will succeed by vote.",
      "But on one day each fortnight that Parliament sits, bills drawn from the cookie tin are debated. On Thursday, with spaces for three new bills suddenly available, Wilson presided over a ballot in Parliament\u2019s library.",
      "A small crowd of staffers and lawmakers watched as the clerk\u2019s colleagues tipped numbered bingo tokens representing each bill into the cookie tin with a flourish, shook the vessel, and drew. Spectators could find out by email which bills had won the lottery, Wilson said.",
      "\u201cI just think they quite like the performance of it,\u201d he said.",
      "All lawmakers who aren\u2019t ministers are permitted to enter one bill at a time into the ballot. It\u2019s drawn by someone who isn\u2019t affiliated to a political party including school students or visitors celebrating birthdays.",
      "So-called members\u2019 bills \u2013 and ballot or negotiation systems to select which will advance \u2013 are a feature of Westminster parliamentary democracies worldwide. But Wilson did not know of another country with such an unusual ceremony.",
      "The ritual began pragmatically, a bid to end a practice that wearied officials before. Once, lawmakers would race to the clerk\u2019s office to submit bills when a spot on the agenda became free, sometimes queuing overnight.",
      "It prompted the purchase of the cookie tin and a tradition that blends dry procedural necessity and New Zealand\u2019s cheerful cultural irreverence. Visitors to Parliament can buy mugs and socks printed with the tin\u2019s distinctive blue pattern at the gift shop.",
      "The lottery has produced some of New Zealand\u2019s most notable modern laws. Bills legalizing marriage equality and voluntary euthanasia were once drawn from the cookie tin and eventually enacted after their sponsors launched sweeping public campaigns to sway the opinions of their peers.",
      "That was the hope of two lawmakers whose measures were selected from the ballot Thursday and who said they would campaign to rally cross-party support.",
      "Arena Williams will seek a law change forcing greater transparency about the fees associated with international money transfers, which she said would especially benefit working people who send money to their families abroad. It was the second of her measures selected from the tin, improbably good luck for a lawmaker of fewer than five years.",
      "Meanwhile, a \u201cdelighted\u201d Tim van de Molen, whose law would prohibit the improper use or disposal of military decorations, was celebrating his first cookie tin victory after seven and a half years in Parliament.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a quirky part of our system that I think is typically Kiwi,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty basic sort of system, but she\u2019ll be right. It does the job.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing, heroic logistical effort where, in very difficult circumstances, many volunteers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to rescue a complete stranger. And over the coming days and weeks, we will hear scores of stories of locals being plucked out of impossible, desperate situations,\u201d Minns told reporters in Maitland in the flood area.",

      "Despite the easing rain, State Emergency Service Commissioner Mike Wassing said crews were still looking out for floodwaters potentially rising due to water continuing to flow into catchments.",
      "\u201cWe still do have active flood rescues still coming into the system and we\u2019re dealing with those on a case-by-case\" basis, Wassing said. \u201cWe have seen that tempo drop off, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",

      "North Korea has begun steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for a failed launch of its second naval destroyer this week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence.",
      "The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was \u201cnot serious\u201d and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.",
      "The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.",
      "Observers believe North Korea\u2019s admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim\u2019s resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.",
      "The North\u2019s Central Military Commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.",
      "\u201cNo matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,\u201d the commission said, according to KCNA.",
      "Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.",
      "The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.",
      "The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.",

      "Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are scheduled to vote May 27 on the revised contract offer. The company said the tentative agreement, reached after the two sides resumed talks on Thursday, addresses \u201ckey points of interest among union members.\" It did not provide details.",

      "Union members began picketing at Pratt's manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001.",
      "\u201cPratt and Whitney is a powerhouse in military and commercial aerospace products because our membership makes it so,\u201d David Sullivan, the union\u2019s eastern territory vice president, said in a statement at the time. \u201dThis offer does not address the membership concerns, and the membership made their decision \u2014 we will continue to fight for a fair contract.\u201d",
      "The company, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., had called its earlier wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry.",
      "The strike has come as RTX faces a potential $850 million hit on profits this year because of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, if the tariff rates remain the same through the year. During its first-quarter earnings call on April 22, the company said its Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace subsidiaries would each shoulder just over $400 million of the potential tariffs hit.",
      "RTX is predicting $83 billion to $84 billion in adjusted sales companywide in 2025. The company\u2019s first-quarter earnings were $1.5 billion. Pratt & Whitney\u2019s adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $590 million.",
      "The company said its earlier contract proposal included an immediate 4% wage increase, followed by a 3.5% increase in 2026 and a 3% increase in 2027. It also included a $5,000 contract ratification bonus and enhanced pension and 401k plan benefits.",
      "Pratt & Whitney makes engines for commercial and military jets, including the GTF line for Airbus commercial jets and the F135 for the military\u2019s F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft fleet.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who joined the workers on the picket line, called the tentative agreement \u201ca solid step forward for Pratt\u2019s highly skilled machinists, and I hope for a fair settlement soon.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.",
      "Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll put our stamp on it,\u201d he said.",

      "Several Republican senators have said the House\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but \u201cwhen it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.",
      "Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill\u2019s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.",
      "The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn\u2019t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he\u2019s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and \u201chis exact words were, \u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Josh.\u2019\u201d",
      "Others have been wary of the House bill\u2019s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be \u201cprobably be a little bit lower.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that \u201cone of the principal differences\u201d between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts \u2014 including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is \u201can objective right now.\"",
      "One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.",
      "The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won\u2019t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he\u2019s willing to consider it if it\u2019s taken out.",
      "But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to \u201cpay a king\u2019s ransom\u201d to Democrats to get enough votes.",
      "Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could \"create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It\u2019s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it\u2019s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.",
      "With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator\u2019s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions \u2014 selling off telecommunications signal rights \u2014 is a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for him. He said he\u2019s in talks with other senators on the issue.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some work to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Louisiana environmental groups is suing the state over a law they say violates their free speech rights by restricting them from sharing information about air quality",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia \u201cCindy\u201d Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.",
      "But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.",
      "On Thursday, Robertson's group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.",
      "When neighbors asked where the flags went, \"I\u2019d tell them, \u2019The state of Louisiana says we can\u2019t tell y\u2019all that stuff,' \u201d Robertson said.",
      "While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission believed it was intended to censor them with \u201conerous restrictions\u201d and violates their free speech rights, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur's pollution using high quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group's social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.",
      "While federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, fence-line communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.",
      "The Biden administration's EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the \u201cfence-line\u201d with industrial plants that emitted pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups say they lack confidence in the data the state does provide and embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,\u201d the lawsuit stated.",
      "In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana's Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cYou can't talk about air quality unless you're using the equipment that they want you to use,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide \u201cperfectly adequate results ... to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they're breathing is safe.\u201d",
      "Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a small nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay one day's worth of that,\u201d Robertson said. \"And the way the law is written, it\u2019s so ambiguous, you don\u2019t really know what you can and can\u2019t do.\"",
      "There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,\u201d said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights\u2019,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.",
      "Industry groups are excluded from the law's requirements, the lawsuit notes.",
      "The law presumes \u201cthat air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment, citing pending litigation.",

      "The sale included artwork from Brody \u2014 sold for 375,000 euros ($423,755) with lunch with the star thrown in \u2014 and Franco \u2014 (sold for 325,000 euros ($367,254) also with a lunch offered with the winning bid.

      "Brazil-based meat giant JBS hopes an upcoming shareholder vote will put it one step closer to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange",
      "Making meat is a messy business. But for Brazilian meat giant JBS, getting approval to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange has been even messier.",
      "Environmentalists, animal rights groups, U.S. lawmakers and even some of its own investors have tried to stop a U.S. listing for JBS, noting the company\u2019s long record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "But JBS has persevered, saying dual listings in Sao Paulo and New York would attract new investors and better reflect its global portfolio. Late last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted the company\u2019s request to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "JBS is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, with more than 250 production facilities in 17 countries. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. It\u2019s America\u2019s top beef producer and it\u2019s second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "On Friday, JBS\u2019 minority shareholders \u2013 who hold 30% of its shares \u2013 are scheduled to vote on the dual-listing plan. If they approve it, the company could list its shares in New York as early as next month.",
      "Early vote totals, which JBS released Thursday in a filing in Brazil, showed that 52% of shareholders opposed the plan. But there were many more votes to be counted, so the outcome was far from clear.",
      "Last fall, 20 environmental organizations \u2014 including Mighty Earth, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network \u2014 signed an open letter to JBS investors opposing the listing, saying it would put the climate at greater risk.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that shareholders reject the plan.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "\u201cIn our view, the involvement of the company and of Joesley and Wesley Batista in multiple high-profile scandals has tarnished the company\u2019s reputation, undermining stakeholder trust and posing a significant risk to its competitive position,\u201d Glass Lewis said.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which would give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "In its response to Glass Lewis' report, JBS said it has established more stringent controls and anti-corruption training at the company in recent years. It also said a U.S. listing would ensure more oversight from U.S. authorities.",
      "\u201cWe believe this transaction will increase our visibility in global markets, attract new investors and further strengthen our position as a global food industry leader,\u201d JBS Global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said in a statement last month when the company announced Friday\u2019s vote.",
      "But many U.S. lawmakers also aren't convinced JBS belongs on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "In a letter sent last week to JBS, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, noted that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride \u2014 a U.S. company owned by JBS \u2014 was the largest single donor to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, with a $5 million gift. The SEC\u2019s approval came just weeks after that donation, Warren said.",
      "\u201cI am concerned Pilgrim\u2019s Pride may have made its contribution to the inaugural fund to curry favor with the Trump administration,\u201d Warren wrote in the letter, which asked the company why the donation was made.",
      "In a statement, JBS said it has a \u201clong bipartisan history of participating in the civic process.\u201d",
      "Warren was also among a bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators who sent a letter to the SEC in January 2024 urging the agency to reject a U.S. listing for JBS. The senators, a diverse group that rarely agrees on policy, included Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "The letter noted that in 2020, J&F Investments, a controlling shareholder of JBS that is owned by the Batista family, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in U.S. federal court and agreed to pay fines of $256 million.",
      "It also said Pilgrim\u2019s Pride pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges in 2021. And it said U.S. Senate investigations found that JBS is \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to rainforest destruction in the Amazon by its suppliers.",
      "\u201cApproval of JBS\u2019 proposed listing would subject U.S. investors to risk from a company with a history of blatant, systemic corruption, and further entrench its monopoly power and embolden its monopoly practices,\u201d the letter said.",

      "Argentina\u2019s government has unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's government on Thursday unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country, as libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to boost Argentina's low international currency reserves and stimulate the limping economy.",
      "By eliminating tax reporting requirements, the plan invites savers \u2014 who long have swapped their depreciating pesos for American currency in the country's underground market \u2014 to spend unreported dollars on everyday transactions at home. The government won\u2019t ask questions regarding the source of the repatriated funds, officials promised.",
      "\u201cYour dollars, your decision. What\u2019s yours is yours, not the state\u2019s,\u201d Milei\u2019s presidential spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said in a press conference announcing the policies. \u201cYou can use them however you want, without having to prove where you got them from.\u201d",
      "Milei \u2014 who ran on a controversial campaign pledge to \u201cdollarize\u201d Argentina's troubled economy \u2014 wants a new gush of greenbacks to boost the volume of U.S. dollars in circulation.",
      "Although Argentina's depleted currency reserves sent Milei backpedaling from his initial campaign trail-fervor for \u201cburning down\u201d the central bank and adopting the U.S. dollar as the national currency, these latest measures seek to hasten the country\u2019s transition to a new currency system that would see dollars gradually replacing pesos.",
      "Milei's \u201cendogenous dollarization\u201d scheme would involve fixing the supply of the local currency even as Argentines could use dollars or pesos. He hopes this would encourage Argentines to use their dollar-denominated savings to buy houses and cars as the economy grows and more cash is needed in circulation.",
      "To lay the groundwork, Milei\u2019s government last year imposed a generous tax amnesty for Argentines willing to repatriate capital. In April, it lifted most currency controls as part of a $20 billion bail-out deal with the International Monetary Fund, which conditions its support on the government boosting its scarce foreign reserves.",
      "\u201cYou can spend those dollars without anyone bothering you. So, you go, you want to buy, I don\u2019t know, a house for $200,000, no one has to ask you anything,\u201d Milei told the TV channel of Argentine newspaper La Nacion in an interview Monday.",
      "Over decades of financial turmoil, Argentines have come to depend on U.S. dollars to evade a byzantine system of currency controls, hedge against hyperinflation and protect their nest eggs from government freezes, as has happened several times in the country's recent history, such as during the catastrophic 2001 foreign-debt default.",
      "\u201cThis is how we reached a catastrophic outcome in which 50% of our economy ended up being informal, and the state, like Big Brother, controlled all of its citizens\u2019 transactions, as if they were criminals deserving of punishment,\u201d Adorni said.",
      "Argentina\u2019s official statistics agency estimates that, as of late 2024, Argentine households and firms held more than $270 billion outside their financial system, largely denominated in U.S. currency. While most of the billions are in foreign bank accounts, a significant amount of cash is also stuffed under mattresses and floorboards and in rented safety deposit boxes in underground vaults across the country.",
      "\u201cThose who do this are not criminals,\u201d Economy Minister Luis Caputo said Thursday. \u201cThey are the vast majority of Argentines who have been abused by excessive taxes and controls.",
      "To encourage Argentines to spend their repatriated funds, the new measures scrap strict requirements for businesses and credit card providers to report citizens' purchases to ARCA, Argentina's equivalent of the IRS. They relax strict tax evasion rules so property buyers and public notaries won't need to report transactions. Banks won't be able to request access to clients' tax records.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like an invitation not to pay taxes,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at advisory firm Medley Global Advisors.",
      "That raises concerns about an injection of potentially dirty funds, some of which could be the product of illegal activity. Asked about the danger created by the new fiscal incentives, the IMF sounded a cautious note.",
      "\u201cThe authorities have committed to strengthening financial transparency,\u201d said Julie Kozack, an IMF spokesperson. \u201cAny new measures, including those that may be aimed at encouraging the use of undeclared assets, should be, of course, consistent with these important commitments.\u201d",

      "This type of study can't prove cause and effect, but the findings hint at a connection worth exploring. More than a dozen cancers are associated with obesity.",
      "\u201cThis is a call to scientists and clinical investigators to do more work in this area to really prove or disprove this,\u201d said Dr. Ernest Hawk of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The findings were released Thursday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be discussed at its annual meeting in Chicago. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was led by Lucas Mavromatis, a medical student at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cChronic disease and chronic disease prevention are some of my passions,\u201d said Mavromatis, a former research fellow with an NIH training program.",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists are injections used to treat diabetes, and some are also approved to treat obesity. They work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They don't work for everyone and can produce side effects that include nausea and stomach pain.",
      "In the study, researchers analyzed data from 43 U.S. health systems to compare two groups: people with obesity and diabetes who took GLP-1 drugs and other people with the same conditions who took diabetes drugs like sitagliptin. The two groups were equal in size and matched for other characteristics.",
      "After four years, those who took GLP-1 drugs had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause compared to those who took the other type of diabetes drug. There were 2,501 new cases of obesity-related cancer in the GLP-1 group compared to 2,671 cases in the other group.",
      "The effect was evident in women, but not statistically significant in men. The study couldn't explain that difference, but Mavromatis noted that differences in blood drug concentration, weight loss, metabolism or hormones could be at play.",

      "A private plane clipped power lines before crashing into a home early Thursday in San Diego, killing the co-founder of a music talent agency and two of its employees and igniting cars in a neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing.",
      "The Sound Talent Group said co-founder Dave Shapiro died in the crash. He is listed as the plane's owner and has a pilot's license, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The talent agency did not provide the names of the other employees.",
      "At least 100 residents were moved to a nearby elementary school serving as an evacuation center, the San Diego Police Department said.",
      "The plane was headed from New Jersey to San Diego after a fueling stop in Kansas. It crashed about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from San Diego's Montgomery-Gibbs Executive airport.",
      "San Diego officials had said earlier that two people died in the crash, but the National Transportation Safety Board now says the number of deaths is unknown. The FAA said six people were on board the plane.",

      "Assistant San Diego Fire Chief Dan Eddy said the fog was thick: \u201cYou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "Several people were injured while trying to flee after the crash, and others were treated for smoke inhalation, authorities said.",
      "At least one home was destroyed with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed. About 10 others suffered damage. Half a dozen vehicles were melted and scorched into burned shells.",
      "Jet fuel rolled down the street and the smell of it lingered in the air while authorities worked to extinguish one stubborn car fire that sent smoke billowing up.",
      "Christopher Moore, who lives one street over from the crash site, said he and his wife were awakened by a loud bang, and he saw smoke out the window. The couple grabbed their three young boys and ran out of the house. They saw a car in flames on their way out of the neighborhood.",

      "The budget reconciliation bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.",
      "A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.",
      "The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden\u2019s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.",
      "\u201cIn a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "\u201cThese credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.",
      "President Donald Trump celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, calling it \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.\u201d Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.",
      "The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.",
      "Full-scale repeal of current credits \"could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.",
      "\"A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,\u201d the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.",
      "In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.",
      "The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.",
      "Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.",
      "House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China \u2014 an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.",
      "The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don\u2019t start construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.",
      "\u201cThis bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it\u2019s proving to be not only economically beneficial \u2014 lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies \u2014 but also essential to America\u2019s energy future,\" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.",
      "At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.",
      "The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.",
      "\u201cOnce the land is sold, we will never get it back,\u201d Zinke said after the provision\u2019s removal. \u201dPublic access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism \u2014 our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.\u201d",
      "The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.",
      "Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to make the transfers happen.",
      "Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.",
      "Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke\u2019s work to prevent the public lands sale.",
      "But she added that the bill was still a \u201cbig giveaway\u201d to the private sector. \u201cBy opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.",
      "Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.",

      "The increase in mortgage rates is discouraging some would-be homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest period of the year for home sales. Last week, mortgage applications fell 5.1% from a week earlier as home loan borrowing costs increased, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",

It poses questions over the necessity of school mandates that require children to get vaccinated for admittance and suggestions that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has raised doubts about the safety of shots even as a measles outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 Americans. This week, Kennedy\u2019s health department moved to limit U.S. access to COVID-19 shots.",
      "The report does not provide any evidence that the childhood vaccine schedule, which includes shots for measles, polio and the chickenpox, is to blame for rising obesity, diabetes or autism rates, said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University.",

      "But Kennedy's MAHA supporters were also disappointed, saying the report didn't go far enough when it came to chemicals used on crops.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump White House and Republicans don't take pesticides and glyphosate's link to human health issues seriously, it will cost them the MAHA vote in the midterms,\u201d said Dave Murphy, a former Kennedy fundraiser who spearheaded a push for the issue to be addressed in the report.",
      "Talking about the report on Thursday, Trump reiterated his \u201clove\u201d for farmers.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins acknowledged the tight rope Trump officials are walking to keep farmers, many of them in Republican-leaning states, happy while also working to satisfy Kennedy's eclectic and health-conscious following.",
      "\u201cDo all of us agree on everything? Of course not,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBut the place that we have landed, which is, I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture and health.\u201d",
      "The report comes out stronger, however, against ultraprocessed foods \u2014 industrially made products high in refined grains, sugar, saturated fats and additives like artificial dyes that now make up two-thirds of the diet for U.S. teens and children. Such products have been linked to a host of poor health outcomes, though documenting how they cause those problems has been notoriously difficult and time-consuming.",
      "The MAHA commission report \u201cis a pretty accurate depiction of the nutrition crisis facing our country,\u201d said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, an expert in nutrition and policy at Tufts University.",
      "The report focuses not only on ultraprocessed foods, but also on how too few fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and fish are present in U.S. diets, he noted. But the report leaves out excess salt, which causes harm, even in young children.",
      "The MAHA report calls on the National Institutes of Health to execute sweeping, nationwide studies of ultraprocessed foods, even as the White House has called for $18 billion to be axed from the agency's budget. An extra $500 million has been requested from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative.",
      "The report raises concerns about other environmental and chemical research results, funded by corporations and industry, being skewed.",
      "But the MAHA commission's call for more neutral research comes as sweeping budget and staff cuts propelled by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have resulted in 20,000 jobs lost at the nation\u2019s health department and billions of dollars rescinded for research studies. The Trump administration also gutted the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program in its cuts of health-tracking programs.",
      "The report also raises concerns about the lack of physical activity among children and their prescription drug use, including antibiotics and medications used to treat attention deficit disorders.",
      "Some in the MAHA movement have raised concerns about offering medications, even over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers, to children.",
      "But Trump spent 10 minutes during Thursday's event telling MAHA supporters how he's working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The East Room crowd, packed full of MAHA supporters that offered applause for Trump's calls to investigate chronic disease in children, responded mildly \u2014 and eventually stopped clapping entirely \u2014 as he continued to talk about lowering drug costs.",
      "\u201cI think it's going to go down as one of the most important things we've ever down because drug prices are going to go down,\u201d he said, as Kennedy looked on.",

      "Miranda Wang of China had the best round of the week on the El Camaleon course at Mayakoba, running off seven birdies and keeping a clean card for a 65. That leaft Wang and Brianna Do (71) one shot behind.",

      "\u201cThere is going to be some stress and pressure added to it, but I think as long as I keep my momentum and just try to stay positive on every shot and every hoe, I think I'll be OK,\u201d Bae said,",
      "She was at 6-under 138 on what has been a tough golf course with wind and heat. El Camaleon on Mayakoba is where the PGA Tour played from 2007 through 2024, and where the LIV Golf League played last year.",
      "Do, among four players tied for the 18-hole lead, was the only player to reach 8 under for the tournament until a bogey-double bogey finish on the front nine. She still was in position for her first win, one off the lead.",

      "Jenny Shin, another of the co-leaders after Thursday, shot 72 and was two behind. The other two who opened with 68, Chisato Iwai and Bianca Pagdanganan, each followed with a 74. Pagdanganan was slowed by a triple bogey on her 11th hole, the par-4 second.",
      "Wang, meanwhile, found the right recipe for Mayakoba. For the Duke alum, Wang figured it was best to take care of the par 5s and some of the short par 4s and keep mistakes to a minimum. She birdied three of the four par 5s and kept mistakes completely off her card.",
      "\u201cThere are good opportunities out there, short par 4s and short par 5s. Today when I did well, I really took the chances,\u201d Wang said. \u201cSo I think for a player to have a good round here it\u2019s just like the short holes you have to get close and make birdies and the long hole, just make good swings and pars out there.\u201d",
      "The tournament is the last one before the U.S. Women's Open at Erin Hills, and the Mexico reflected that. Charley Hull is the highest-ranked player on the Yucatan Peninsula at No. 15 in the world. She shot 75 and was nine shots behind.",
      "Maria Fassi carried the flag for Mexico. The former NCAA champion at Arkansas had a 72 and was at 3-over 147, but at least will be around for the weekend. Gaby Lopez managed only a 73 and missed the cut.",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota Frost forward Britta Curl-Salemme was able to find peace amid the boos and criticism she's faced during much of her rookie season",
      "Amid the choruses of boos, crosschecks and on-line social media attacks directed at Britta Curl-Salemme for what's seemed like most of her rookie PWHL season, the Minnesota Frost forward was able to experience a few moments of clarity and joy in the playoffs.",
      "They came Thursday night, when Curl-Salemme forced overtime by converting a rebound with 16 seconds left in regulation and then scored 16:24 into the extra period of a 2-1 victory in Ottawa to even the best-of-five Walter Cup Finals series at 1.",
      "If the two clutch goals placed an even bigger target on the 25-year-old\u2019s back, then so be it, Curl-Salemme said during a Zoom conference call Friday when asked if she considered herself being the PWHL\u2019s first \u201cvillain.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure some people think that. I try not to get too involved with the outside noise or perspectives. I don't think that's helpful to me,\u201d she said, in preparing for Game 3 at Minnesota on Saturday. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way it shakes out and I\u2019m doing my job and doing what I am proud of, and the things I\u2019m supposed to be doing, then that may be it. But, yeah, I\u2019m not too worried about it.\u201d",
      "Curl-Salemme\u2019s transition from winning three NCAA titles at Wisconsin to the professional ranks hasn\u2019t gone smoothly. She\u2019s gained a polarizing reputation for her physical style, which has drawn three suspensions this season, and for her on-line support of transphobic messaging, for which she apologized in a video post days after being drafted in the second round in June.",
      "As much as Curl-Salemme, from Bismarck, North Dakota, has hoped to move forward, the booing crowd in Ottawa \u2014 she was loudly heckled while conducting a TV interview between periods coming off the ice \u2014 was a stark reminder.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t really speak to the reasons behind it or anything,\u201d Curl-Salemme said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s annoying as hell being an opponent or being an opposing fan, the style that I play. I kind of try to embrace that, obviously, to a certain point,\u201d she added. \u201cI want to be a nuisance. I want to make it hard to play against me.\u201d",
      "While relishing her role as an on-ice pest, Curl-Salemme acknowledged being challenged adapting her style to stay within the rules.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going out on the ice trying to hurt somebody or do something stupid. That\u2019s never my intention,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of maturity in my game and just figuring out how to play that way.\u201d",
      "The comments were among Curl-Salemme\u2019s first since posting her apology nearly a year ago.",
      "\u201cI specifically recognize that my social media activity has resulted in hurt being felt across communities, including LGBTQ+ and BIPOC individuals, and I just want to apologize and take ownership of that,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve learned so much through this, and I\u2019m seeing it as an opportunity to grow in humility and grow in love,\u201d she added. \u201cTo those of you who may still have reservations, I hope you can extend me the grace to prove to you who I really am.\u201d",
      "Curl-Salemme\u2019s social media activity and getting drafted by Minnesota reignited criticism of the franchise at a time the inaugural Walter Cup champions were dealing with questions over why the PWHL abruptly removed Natalie Darwitz as general manager.",
      "Without getting into specifics, league vice president Jayna Hefford explained an internal investigation determined a change was necessary because \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a path forward with the current personnel in place.\u201d",
      "The attention then turned to coach Ken Klee for overseeing the draft and selecting Curl-Salemme in light of her posts. Klee defended the decision in drafting the two-year Wisconsin captain by saying the team did its homework in consulting her coaches and teammates.",
      "The shadow of controversy, however, has followed her since in PWHL circles, even as Curl-Salemme has maintained her role playing for the U.S. national team and won gold at the world championships last month.",
      "She finished the regular season tied for sixth on the Frost with 15 points (nine goals, six assists), while also ranking second on the team with 24 penalty minutes.",
      "In the playoffs, she\u2019s tied for the team lead with three goals. And she leads the league with 15 penalty minutes, all stemming from her drawing a one-game suspension for an illegal hit to the head of Toronto defenseman Renata Fast in Game 1 of Minnesota\u2019s semifinal series.",
      "Klee on Friday credited Curl-Salemme for keeping her cool and holding her ground in front of the net while being cross-checked before scoring the tying goal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do, especially in hostile environments that we play in,\u201d Klee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a huge credit to her and how focused she can remain, and stay calm in that moment and be able to finish.\u201d",
      "Curl-Salemme was rewarded in the locker room afterward in being presented with a Frost belt in honor of being the game MVP.",
      "She responded by saying: \u201cI just have one message: Minnesota Frost versus the world.\u201d",
      "Nothing personal, Curl-Salemme said regarding her message.",
      "\u201cIt feels like all that matters is what\u2019s in the locker room and our staff and our organization,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take the people in the room. So I think that was the main message is there\u2019s people trying to stop us, and we\u2019re going to try to push through.\u201d",

      "Newgarden and Power will both start from the final row of the 33-car grid on Sunday after their cars were found to have a part that was illegal altered ahead of qualifying. But both of them had fast cars in the final 2-hour practice on Carb Day, and then they showed that their crews are just as fast in the annual competition on pit lane.",
      "In the decisive matchup, Newgarden's team stopped the clock in 10.263 seconds and Power in 10.503, giving the two-time Indy 500 winner his second consecutive pit-stop championship and Team Penske its 20th dating back to its first in 1981.",
      "\u201cThese are the unsung heroes of this race. They're risking it every time we're coming in,\u201d said Newgarden, who will start 32nd on Sunday as he chases an unprecedented three-peat. \u201cIt's not easy to do this job.

The defending champion shot 69 while Daniel Berger, one of the eight top-25 players in the field, made an 83-foot putt from just off the green for birdie on the par-3 fourth hole in a round of 70. Both were at 2-over 142.",

It's definitely been a breakthrough year, but I think there's more to come.\u201d",
      "Fowler has dropped to 127th in the world after being in the top 25 as recently as early 2024. The six-time winner was solid in the $20 million signature Truist Championship two weeks ago but missed the cut at the PGA.",
      "The 36-year-old followed an opening 70 with six birdies before finishing even over his final nine holes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely coming around,\u201d said Fowler, who has just one victory since 2019, the Rocket Mortgage Classic two years ago. \u201cI know it\u2019s been slow last year and slow start to the year. Body is starting to feel better, and the game (has) been in a good spot and not very far off. It\u2019s a fine line out here. Nice to see things starting to come together a bit.\u201d",

      "Signs of frustration have been evident for the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference finals against an Oklahoma City Thunder team chasing its first title with a mix of poise, precision and relentlessness unseen anywhere else in these NBA pla...",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The newest NBA MVP put his head down and dribbled toward the basket, an attempt by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to lunge past one of the league's best perimeter defenders midway through the fourth quarter of another decisive victory by Oklahoma City in the Western Conference finals.",
      "After his right arm was subtly hooked by Gilgeous-Alexander at the beginning of the drive, Jaden McDaniels reached for the middle of his back and pushed Minnesota's tormentor with enough force to send him stumbling to the floor on Thursday with the Thunder up by 16 points.",
      "McDaniels got a Flagrant 1 penalty and shrugged off the significance of the shove afterward. He had fouls to give, he said, so he used one. But it was a clear sign of frustration for the Timberwolves, who have so far seen their own championship aspirations overwhelmed by a well-constructed team chasing the title with a mix of poise, precision and relentlessness unseen anywhere else in these NBA playoffs.",
      "\u201cWe've got to meet their aggression,\u201d said Julius Randle, who had by far his worst performance of this postseason in Game 2 with just six points on 2-for-11 shooting and four turnovers.",
      "The Thunder will take a 2-0 lead and a load of confidence and momentum into Game 3 on Saturday night at Target Center in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cWe've got to be desperate,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cEvery possession matters.\u201d",
      "One of the most discouraging developments for the Wolves from Game 2 was that they held the Thunder to 9-for-33 shooting from 3-point range and still lost by 15.",
      "Deftly bucking the data-driven NBA trend away from midrange jumpers, the Thunder shot 63% on 2-pointers, many of them outside of the lane against a Wolves team that has established itself as big, fast and strong enough to consistently take away the rim and the perimeter.",
      "\u201cWe have to do just a better job of contesting that. We\u2019re trying to take away a lot of things. They do a great job of getting into those spots,\u201d said Mike Conley, who at plus-19 is the only net-positive player for the Wolves in the series.",
      "The rest of the guards in their usual eight-man rotation have been badly outscored during their time on the court. Anthony Edwards is a minus-45, Donte DiVincenzo is a minus-47, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker is a minus-20.",
      "Just as critical as tightening up the middle of their defense for the Wolves will be getting Randle going again. After averaging 24 points on 52% shooting over his first 11 games of the playoffs, including Game 1 of this series, his struggle against the Thunder's intense ball pressure was so pronounced on Thursday that coach Chris Finch kept him on the bench for the entire fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cProbably just standing and spectating too much,\u201d Randle said. \u201cI've got to get myself into actions, get myself on the move. We know what type of defense they are. They\u2019re going to swarm you.\u201d",
      "Unfortunately for the Wolves, the Thunder got their wakeup call out of the way nearly three weeks ago when they wasted a 13-point lead midway through the fourth quarter and lost their second-round opener when Denver's Aaron Gordon hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 3 seconds left.",
      "The Nuggets presented several different defensive strategies that the Thunder ultimately figured out how to pivot away from on their way to winning the series in seven games. The Wolves have done the same so far, emptying the playbook in an attempt to keep Gilgeous-Alexander's slick-moving, smooth-shooting game in check and the role players from beating them beyond the arc.",
      "But while the Wolves are superior defensively to the Nuggets, the Thunder used that experience to not practice the postseason art of quick adjustment \u2014 and cut their teeth in some close games. They took plenty of tactical and mental momentum, into this matchup.",
      "\u201cWe had our backs against the wall and had to respond multiple times in that series,\u201d coach Mark Daigneault said. \"And now we have a different challenge. We\u2019re up 2-0 going into their place. We know they\u2019re going to play very aggressively, hard, comfortably at home, and now we\u2019ve got to have the mental toughness to go and rise to that challenge.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers working for Russian military intelligence targeted Western technology and logistics companies involved in shipping assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. National Security Agency said.",
      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "Software engineer Joe Lopez could be heard shouting at Nadella in the opening minutes Monday of the tech giant's annual Build developer conference in Seattle before getting escorted out of the room. Lopez later sent a mass email to colleagues disputing the company's claims about how its Azure cloud computing platform is used in Gaza.",
      "Lopez's outburst was the first of several pro-Palestinian disruptions at the event that drew thousands of software developers to the Seattle Convention Center. At least three talks by executives were disrupted, the company even briefly cut the audio of one livestreamed event. Protesters also gathered outside the venue.",
      "Microsoft has previously fired employees who protested company events over its work in Israel, including at its 50th anniversary party in April.",
      "Microsoft acknowledged last week that it provided AI services to the Israeli military for the war in Gaza but said it had found no evidence to date that its Azure platform and AI technologies were used to target or harm people in Gaza.",
      "The advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, led by employees and ex-employees, says Lopez received a termination letter after his Monday protest but couldn't open it. The group also says the company has blocked internal emails that mention words including \u201cPalestine\u201d and \u201cGaza.\u201d",
      "Microsoft hasn't returned emailed requests for comment about its response to this week's protests. The four-day conference ends Thursday.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",
      "In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is \u201cNingde Era.\"",
      "CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.",
      "Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn\u2019t seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.",
      "The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.",
      "The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.",
      "CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals\u2019 $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",

      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",

      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

    "summary": "Law enforcement is coming under scrutiny over its use of live facial recognition cameras.",
    "story": [
      "Five of the 10 inmates who escaped have been recaptured.",
      "During the ongoing massive manhunt for 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail last week, authorities say the use of facial recognition cameras run by a private organization helped lead to the recapture of one of the fugitives -- even as the police department has come under scrutiny by critics from civil rights organizations to conservative politicians over its use of the technology.",
      "Earlier this week, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told ABC News that facial recognition cameras maintained by Project N.O.L.A. had been used in the New Orleans manhunt despite the fact that she recently ordered a pause in the automated alerts her officers had been receiving from the group, which operates independently of the police department.",
      "Kirkpatrick recently told The Washington Post she ordered the alerts to officers turned off until she is \"sure that the use of the app meets all the requirements of the law and policies.\"",
      "Citing the New Orleans Police Department's partnership with Project N.O.L.A., the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement it is believed to be the first known widespread effort by a major American law enforcement agency to use artificial intelligence technology to identify suspects in an assortment of crimes across the city.",
      "In a statement, the ACLU said the use of live facial recognition raises constitutional and privacy issues and \"is a radical and dangerous escalation of the power to surveil people as we go about our daily lives.\"",
      "Critics of the New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition cameras said that the average citizen should understand that they are not opting in or are being made aware that they are being scanned by the cameras.",
      "\"Facial recognition technology poses a direct threat to the fundamental rights of every individual and has no place in our cities,\" Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said in a statement about the city's partnership with Project N.O.L.A. \"We call on the New Orleans Police Department and the City of New Orleans to halt this program indefinitely and terminate all use of live-feed facial recognition technology.\"",
      "Some Republicans in Congress also opposed the unchecked use of the technology, most notably Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Warren Davidson of Ohio, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Steve Daines of Montana.",
      "In a March 27, 2025 letter to Kash Patel, who was then acting director of the federal Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms Explosives, Biggs, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, and Davidson raised concerns over news reports indicating the ATF utilized facial recognition technology to identify gun owners. \"The Subcommittee has concerns about ATF's use of facial recognition and Al programs and the effects that its use has upon American citizens' Second Amendment rights and rights to privacy,\" the lawmakers wrote in their letter, requesting documents on policies and training in the use of facial recognition technology.",
      "Democrats, including Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon have also joined bipartisan efforts to curtail the use of such surveillance.",
      "The 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans on May 16, officials said. Five of the fugitives have since been recaptured, leaving five others, including three charged with murder, still on the run as of Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kirkpatrick told ABC News this week that one of the fugitives was caught and another narrowly got away after live facial recognition cameras operated by Project N.O.L.A. located them while scanning crowds in the French Quarter.",
      "Bryan Lagarde, executive director of Project N.O.L.A., told ABC News that after being notified of the jailbreak on Friday, state police gave his group a list of the escapees.",
      "\"We put that into our facial recognition. It took approximately four minutes to do that and within, literally, less than a minute later we started tracking two of the escapees,\" Lagarde said.",
      "He said the information about fugitive Kendall Myles and another escaped inmate, who he said is facing attempted second-degree murder charges, was sent to state police investigators who confirmed the two men were part of the jailbreak.",
      "\"Then they immediately went out to the French Quarter, which is where we were tracking them walking down Bourbon Street,\" Lagarde said.",
      "Myles was arrested after police found him hiding under a car. The second escapee, however, managed to get away.",
      "\"I'm sure they knew there were cameras because they were walking around with their faces held down and things like that. All it takes is just a second for them to look up and then there's facial recognition,\" Lagarde said.",
      "Citing the ongoing investigation, Lagarde declined to say if his cameras have located any of the other escapees.",
      "Largarde said that his organization has been using live facial recognition cameras in New Orleans for the past two years.",
      "In response to potential privacy concerns, Lagarde said, \"As far as the facial recognition is concerned, it's scanning your face, my face, everyone's faces. If you're wanted and we know that you're wanted, you're going to be in trouble. If you are not wanted, its going to instantly disregard your face and just move on to the next person.\"",
      "He said his group maintains about 5,000 cameras in New Orleans, including 200 that have facial recognition capabilities. He said the facial recognition cameras not only scan faces, but also clothing, vehicle and license plates.",

      "\"We work a very large number of the major crimes here in New Orleans: Homicides, shootings, stabbings, home invasions, rapes, robberies all the way down to the thefts and the burglaries,\" Lagarde said.",
      "Project N.O.L.A. works with the New Orleans Police Department and the Louisiana State Police but does not have an official contract with either agency, officials said.",
      "Before the manhunt, the New Orleans police had appeared to distance themselves from Project N.O.L.A..",
      "The police department \"does not own, rely on, manage, or condone the use by members of the department of any artificial intelligence systems associated with the vast network\" of Project N.O.L.A.'s cameras, a spokesman for the police department agency said in a statement to The Washington Post.",
      "Kirkpatrick, the New Orleans police superintendent, said her agency has operated surveillance cameras across the city, many in the entertainment districts, but none of them have facial recognition capabilities. According to the New Orleans Police & Justice Foundation, the city has about 3,600 police operated cameras across the city.",
      "While the city has an ordinance on the use of facial recognition technology, Kirkpatrick said there are exceptions to the rules.",
      "\"Sometimes, people think that we have a total ban on the use of facial recognition and that is not quite accurate,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"There are exceptions, and I think that this one would meet the exception of those ordinances.\"",
      "According to the city ordinance, \"Evidence obtained from facial recognition alone shall not be sufficient to establish probable cause for the purpose of effectuating an arrest by the NOPD or another law enforcement agency. The source of the image and the underlying reasons for the requested use of facial recognition systems as an investigative lead shall be documented in a police report.\"",
      "The ordinance says \"facial-recognition technology, shall not be used as a surveillance tool.\" But the ordinance also states that \"nothing in this section shall prohibit NOPD from requesting the use of facial recognition technology in the investigation of the prior occurrence of the following significant crimes as defined in Louisiana Revised Statute,\" including murder, manslaughter, solicitation of murder, first-degree robbery, drive-by shootings and carjackings.",
      "\"They had my permission, that's for sure,\" Kirkpatrick said of the use of facial recognition technology in the manhunt.",
      "Three of the five escaped inmates still being sought on Friday have been have been charged with murder or attempted murder, including one who was convicted in a double homicide, authorities.",
      "The Washington Post investigation published this week reported that New Orleans police were using Project N.O.L.A.'s network of facial recognition cameras to monitor the streets for wanted suspects over the past two years in ways that appeared \"out of step\" with the local ordinance.",
      "In the interview with ABC about the manhunt, Kirkpatrick said that Project N.O.L.A. is a \"useful partner\" but stressed that it is not law enforcement and is not bound by the local ordinance, raising issues of accountability about Project N.O.L.A. and the data it collects on ordinary citizens who are being surveilled in this untargeted manner.",
      "\"I'm very supportive of any technology that we can use to bring violent people back in, and then we can deal with the issues later, but we actually operate within the boundaries of the law,\" she said. \"As long as it's constitutional, ethical, we're going to stay within the boundaries. But this is a bigger topic and discussion, mainly for our politicians to decide what kind of laws they want.\"",
      "Other police departments across the country have faced questions over their use of the technology.",
      "The use of facial recognition software by U.S. businesses has also grown sharply in recent years, analysts and privacy advocates told ABC News.",
      "The uses range from tech companies securing personal devices and retailers scanning for potential shoplifters to e-commerce giants tracking delivery drivers. Retailers are also using facial recognition scanning on shoppers to adjust pricing in stores.",
      "Companies contend that the technology helps them achieve a safe and efficient operation, benefiting consumers and employees alike. Critics say the powerful tool encroaches on the privacy of everyday people, risking undue punishment or discrimination, the experts said.",
      "Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, said facial recognition cameras are an \"unproven, error-prone tool.\"",
      "\"This is the first documented case in the U.S. of police using untargeted facial recognition, which countries like China employ to track people across cities and surveil their Uyghur citizens,\" Laperruque said in a statement to ABC News regarding New Orleans' police use of the technology. \"This kind of dragnet system belongs in a dystopian sci-fi movie, not in American cities. Average pedestrians shouldn't have to worry that untested AI technology will set off alarm bells and send police after them.\"",
      "One of the key issues of facial recognition and AI is that studies have shown that it can be racially biased and is particularly error prone with people of color, older people and women.",
      "\"There's been error rates between 80 and 90%. That means nine out of every ten times that the system says, 'Hey, here's someone from our watch list,' it's actually a false alarm,\" Laperruque said of the use of these cameras as untargeted or real-time surveillance tools based on pilot programs run in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"Facial recognition could be used to catalog attendees at a protest or political rallies of any affiliation, individuals going to a church, people visiting a medical clinic, or an array of other sensitive activities,\" Laperruque told ABCNews.",
      "He added, \"Given these risks it\u2019s no surprise that surveillance reform in general -- and placing guardrails on facial recognition in particular -- has support from across the political spectrum, including some of the most progressive and conservative members of Congress -- just last month at a Congressional hearing conservative members of Congress highlighted the dangers of facial recognition and other unchecked forms of surveillance.\"",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack early Saturday with explosions and machine gun fire heard throughout the city, forcing many Kyiv residents to take shelter in underground subway stations.",
      "The nighttime Russian attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an exchange that was agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday, acting head of Kyiv military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, wrote on Telegram. According to Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "Prior to the attack, city mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned Kyiv residents of more than 20 Russian strike drones heading towards Kyiv. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend that will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "As the freed men entered the medical facility Friday, people holding signs and photos of their relatives shouted names or brigade numbers, seeking any news of a loved one. The returning men inspected the photos, and a serviceman said he shared a cell with one of those on the sea of portraits held out toward him.",
      "\u201cVanya!\u201d cried Nataliia Mosych, among the gathered relatives, \u201cMy husband!\u201d",

      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",

      "Despite repeated claims from the White House that President Donald Trump's Thursday night gala for the top holders of his cryptocurrency meme coin had nothing to do with his official duties, several of those investors visited the White House Friday afternoon for what they described as a special VIP event, the attendees told ABC News.",
      "Sangrok Oh, a Korean crypto investor and entrepreneur, told ABC News on Friday that he and other top investors had been invited to tour the White House Friday afternoon, though it was not clear to him whether Trump himself would meet them.",
      "\"So, we're going to visit and tour the White House [and] at the same time talk about crypto industries and the future of crypto,\" Oh said.",
      "Thursday night's black tie event, held at Trump's Washington-area golf club, was attended by around 200 cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, who gained admission through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors in Trump's meme coin -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Critics have blasted the gala as a \"pay for play\" event in which investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin got special access to the president.",
      "News that top $TRUMP coin investors visited the White House appeared to contradict White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion Thursday that the president was attending the crypto gala in a personal capacity, and that since the dinner did not take place at the White House, it was separate from his official duties.",
      "\"The president is attending [the dinner] in his personal time,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.\"",

      "Cherry Hsu, an executive at MemeCore, a Singapore-based blockchain startup, said the firm's founder, known publicly as \"Ice,\" had also been invited to the White House on Friday afternoon. MemeCore, according to the contest leaderboard, finished second in the competition with $TRUMP coin holdings in excess of $1 million.",
      "And late Friday, Justin Sun, a Chinese crupto mogul and the top investor in Trump's meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, \"Was an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse. Such a privilege to see it in person.\"",
      "In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in the $TRUMP coin, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",
      "The Trump meme coin's website at one point earlier this month advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest -- but as of last week, the site said only that a \"Special VIP tour\" would be arranged, without mentioning the White House.",
      "The site also included a disclaimer saying the tour was being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself would be appearing as a \"guest.\"",

      "\"The second day Trump made the announcement about the dinner, I bought a bunch of tokens,\" he said.

      "The judge cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs may be able to survive a legal challenge, thanks in part to a Japanese zipper company that sued the Nixon administration 50 years ago.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Donald Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs -- basing his ruling on the precedent from a 1970s court case -- but stopped short of issuing an order affirming the president's right to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "In a largely technical ruling issued on Tuesday, U.S. Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred one of the first lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs to a different federal court while also weighing in on the legality of the controversial tariffs. Florida-based planner company Emily Ley Paper sued over the tariffs in April, asking Wetherell to invalidate them because Trump lacks the power to impose tariffs himself.",
      "According to the judge, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 gives Trump the authority to set tariffs for reasons other than raising revenue. Wetherell wrote that Trump's justification for the tariffs -- both stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the country and resolving a trade imbalance -- is sufficient to satisfy the terms set by Congress.",
      "\"This is a civil action commenced against the United States and it 'arises out of' a federal law\u2014IEEPA\u2014so the dispositive question framed by the parties' filings is whether IEEPA 'provid[es] for \u2026 tariffs,'\" he wrote. \"Defendants contend that it does; Plaintiffs contend that it doesn't. The Court agrees with Defendants ...\"",
      "The decision is at best a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which is fending off a half dozen lawsuits challenging the legality of the recent \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Judge Wetherell ultimately decided to transfer the case from a federal court in Florida to the Court of International Trade in New York, meaning that, despite his favorable view of the tariffs, he won't be the one deciding the case.",
      "But the decision marks the first time a federal judge has suggested Trump's imposition of tariffs falls within his authority as president, offering a positive sign that the Trump administration may find a receptive audience at the Court of International Trade. During two hearings over the last week, judges at the Court of International Trade have wrestled with the same question about Trump's authority.",
      "The question comes down to the interpretation of the 1970s law that Trump used to impose his tariffs. The IEEPA gives the president the right to \"regulate\" imports but does not explicitly mention tariffs. Lawyers challenging the tariffs have argued that Trump's interpretation of the law oversteps his authority by treading into an issue controlled by Congress, but the Trump administration has pointed judges to a court decision related to the IEEPA's legal predecessor -- the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- to guide the way.",
      "Back when President Richard Nixon confronted the country's 1971 economic crisis with steep tariffs on Japanese goods, a zipper company based in Japan called Yoshida sued Nixon over the tariffs.",
      "The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of International Trade, sided with the government and held that the TWAE gives the president the power to impose tariffs.",
      "According to Wetherell, the same reasoning would apply 50 years later to the IEEPA, meaning Trump has the power to impose tariffs without the help of Congress. \"The reasoning in Yoshida is persuasive, and the Court sees no reason why it would not apply to IEEPA because the operative language of IEEPA is identical to the operative language in TWEA,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Despite losing its legal battle, Yoshida remains in business today. Now operating under the name YKK, it produces more zippers than any other company in the world.",

      "Trump criticized the company's choice to build more iPhones in India.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened 25% tariffs on Apple unless the company shifts iPhonemanufacturing to the United States, saying he disapproves of the company's decision to move part of its supply chain to India.",
      "\"I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump said in a social media post.",
      "But a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain is highly unlikely, industry analysts told ABC News prior to Trump's latest remarks, pointing to the time and expense necessary to overhaul production -- as well as the ongoing cost of higher wages commanded by workers in the U.S.",
      "In theory, the U.S. could host final assembly of Apple products like the iPhone, but even that would take several years and result in higher prices for shoppers, who may then turn to cheaper alternatives, some analysts said.",
      "\"Anything is possible, provided you have a long enough timeframe and don't care about profitability,\" Avi Greengart, lead analyst at research firm Techsponential, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's an incredibly global supply chain. If you want to move it to the U.S., you're talking about many years, possibly decades,\" Greengart added.",
      "Trump last month exempted phones, computers and chips from so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on China-made goods, which at that time amounted to a 125% levy. The move also excluded such products from a 10% across-the-board tariff imposed on nearly all imports.",
      "The policy change provided major cost savings for Apple, which produces about 90% of its smartphones in China.",
      "\"I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business,\" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office days after the exemption took effect.",
      "Last week, Trump temporarily slashed the reciprocal tariffs on China from 125% to 10% as the U.S. and China hold trade negotiations. China still faces 20% tariffs over its role in the fentanyl trade, bringing total levies on Chinese goods to 30%.",
      "On an earnings call earlier this month, Cook said the company had shifted production of iPhones sold in the U.S. to India as a means of avoiding high tariffs.",
      "\"The majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin,\" Cook said.",
      "However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a \"golden age\" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States. And, he explained, tariffs play into that strategy.",
      "He said that the idea is \"to reshore manufacturing, to build here, to have those people who build here not pay any tariffs.\"",
      "\"We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,\" he said in the interview on May 11. \"Those are construction jobs, starting now, and then those products will not have tariffs on them.\"",
      "Cook noted the company already manufactures some components stateside.",
      "\"During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company,\" Cook said. \"All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the US across all 50 states.\"",
      "Still, U.S.-based manufacturing makes up a small share of the company's supply chain \u2013 and any major expansion would take years and carry significant costs, analysts said.",
      "Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush who tracks the tech industry, said last month that it would take three years and cost $30 billion for Apple to shift 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. The price of a U.S.-made iPhone could rise as high as $3,500, Ives said.",
      "\"Price points would move up so dramatically it's hard to comprehend,\" Ives added, describing the notion of a U.S.-made iPhone as a \"nonstarter.\"",
      "The price of an iPhone 16 Pro would jump 25% alone, due to added U.S. labor expenses, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told clients last month in a note shared with ABC News. Such a price hike, which excludes for instance the added cost of factory construction, would bring a $999 smartphone to about $1,250.",
      "A small share of consumers would buy a U.S.-made iPhone even after a significant price hike, but the \"vast majority\" would opt for cheaper alternatives, Ben Bajarin, analyst at research firm Creative Strategies, told ABC News.",
      "The upward pressure on prices as a result of high U.S. labor costs would render domestic manufacturing nearly impossible, presenting Apple with a dilemma, Bajarin said.",
      "\"Production will never happen in the U.S. -- unless we have absolute, fully automated assembly, which completely defeats the purpose because humans won't be doing the jobs,\" Bajarin added.",

      "The notice, both from HHS and the Department of Education, \"articulates extensive factual findings that span a period of over 19 months in which the University continually failed to protect Jewish students,\u201d the government said in its announcement. \u201cThe findings are based on information and documents obtained during the investigation, including witness interviews; examination of written policies and procedures; reliable media reports that contemporaneously capture anti-Semitic incidents and events at Columbia University; and reports from Columbia University\u2019s own Task Force on Antisemitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,\u201d said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS. \u201cWe encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.",
      "The government said that Columbia University failed to take several actions, including failing to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024, failure to abide by its own policies and procedures when responding to Jewish students\u2019 complaints as well as governing misconduct against Jewish students and not investigating or punishing vandalism in its classrooms.",

      "In March, the university agreed to a list of demands from the Trump administration after it canceled $400 million worth of grants and contracts to the institution due to \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\" according to a statement from the Trump administration that month.",

      "The newly sworn-in head of the Social Security Administration told agency staff this week that when he was first offered the job in the Trump administration, he wasn't familiar with the position and had to look it up online.",

And I'm really, I'm really not, I swear I'm not looking for a job,\" Bisignano said, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by ABC News. \"And I'm like, 'Well, what am I going to do?' So, I'm Googling Social Security. You know, one of my great skills, I'm one of the great Googlers on the East Coast.\"",
      "\"I'm like, 'What the heck's the commissioner of Social Security?'\" said Bisignano, who now oversees one of the largest federal agencies that's responsible for distributing retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "\"Put that as the headline for the Post: 'Great Googler in Chief. Chief in Googler' or whatever,\" said Bisignano, who throughout the meeting repeatedly bemoaned media leaks from within the agency.",
      "While Bisignano, who previously served as chairman and CEO of financial technology company Fiserv Inc., brings experience managing large organizations and overseeing complex payment systems to his new role, he has no prior history working in government or with the Social Security system.",
      "A Social Security official told ABC News that Bisignano is \"working to transform the agency into a premier service organization.\"",
      "\"He is visiting offices and meeting employees to hear their ideas for how the agency can better serve customers in-person, on the telephone, and online,\" the official said. \"As the Commissioner evaluates the agency, he has been clear that SSA will have the right staffing to deliver Americans their hard-earned benefits.\"",
      "\"Clearly, Commissioner Bisignano was poking fun at himself so that everyone in the room felt comfortable having an open conversation about improving service for the American people,\" the official added.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston, in a statement to ABC News, said, \"Commissioner Bisignano brings a valuable and much-needed outside perspective to the Social Security Administration. Commissioner Bisignano's proven success in the financial services industry uniquely positions him to lead the Trump Administration's commonsense efforts to modernize the agency and improve its efficiency.\"",
      "In Wednesday's 90-minute call, Bisignano sought to calm concerns about the future of the agency amid recent leadership turnover and scrutiny from Elon Musk's government-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "He told the managers in the meeting that Social Security was \"not going away,\" adding that President Trump also agrees with that.",
      "\"This is America's, you know, safety net -- it's not going away. And hopefully you hear me say this every day,\" he said. \"You know who wants me to tell people that? Guess. The president.\"",
      "\"I've gotten notes about, 'Will the turmoil of the last five months end? Are you here to cause more turmoil?'\" he said. \"I don't think it's the turmoil of the past five months, although I will be the fifth since, you know, November, right?\" Bisignano said, referring to being the fifth person put in charge of the critical agency since Trump was reelected in November.",

      "He said DOGE would be involved in rebuilding the Social Security website and integrating artificial intelligence into the agency's phone support systems.",

    "story": [
      "Investors pumped millions into the coin for a chance to attend the gala.",
      "Hundreds of the top investors in President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency meme coin gathered Thursday for an exclusive black-tie dinner with the president -- what some critics are condemning as a brazen pay-for-play event meant to enrich the most powerful man in the world.",
      "Among those spotted arriving at the event were Lamar Odom of the NBA and \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" fame, cryptocurrency mogul Justin Sun and Kendall Davis, an Austin-based cryptocurrency investor, who told ABC News that he \"came here to advocate for things to be done right in the crypto space.\"",
      "Two hundred and twenty cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, pumped tens of millions of dollars into Trump's meme coin to gain admission to the gala through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Promoted on the coin's website as the \"most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,\" the glitzy affair at Trump's private golf club in Northern Virginia Thursday night was headlined by the president himself.",
      "Critics of the gala, including some Republican lawmakers and cryptocurrency industry advocates, have lambasted the arrangement as an opportunity for the president and his family to improperly benefit personally from his position of power.",
      "Outside of the event, dozens of protesters -- including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- were seen bearing signs that read, \"America is not for sale,\" \"No King\" and\u00a0\"Stop Trump's Crypto Corruption,\" and chanting slogans of a similar sentiment as attendees made their way into the venue.",
      "\"It definitely seems like Trump is selling access to the president through his meme coin, and that money is going directly to his pocket,\" said Molly White, an engineer and crypto researcher who has closely followed Trump's various crypto ventures. \"[Trump] is really using cryptocurrency to boost his personal wealth in ways that he really had not previously done.\"",
      "Trump's meme coin -- a type of digital currency that's often based on an internet meme -- was launched in January, on the eve of his inauguration, and the coin's value immediately soared past $75 per token. But the coin, known as $TRUMP, suffered a precipitous drop in the ensuing weeks, bottoming out in April at around $7.",
      "That's when the gala was announced, framed online as an \"intimate private dinner\" where top investors in $TRUMP would \"hear first-hand President Trump talk about the future of crypto.\" The top 25 investors, the advertisement said, would also receive a \"special VIP tour\" and an exclusive reception with the president before the dinner.",
      "By the following day, the value of the coin ballooned by more than 55%. It then proceeded to fluctuate as those looking to secure admission to the gala bought up the coin and others looking to profit off the hype proceeded to sell",
      "As investors jockeyed for a spot on the venture's online leaderboard, the top 220 collectively spent upwards of $140 million for a seat at the table on Thursday, according to an analysis by the data analytics firm Nansen.",
      "Several investors said the opportunity to rub shoulders with the commander-in-chief -- and, in some cases, promote their business before the most powerful man in the world -- was worth the price of admission.",
      "Cherry Hsu, an executive at a Singapore-based blockchain startup called MemeCore, said the company's co-founder, known online as \"Ice,\" would attend the gala on the firm's behalf after MemeCore finished second in the competition. Hsu told ABC News that \"Ice\" was eager to speak with Trump about \"balancing regulation with decentralization\" in cryptocurrencies, and that their major investment in Trump's meme coin was directly tied to the opportunity to interact with the president.",
      "\"We want to sit next to Trump, if possible,\" she said. \"I think it will be interesting.\"",
      "Like \"Ice,\" most of the other gala attendees remain shrouded in mystery -- their identities hidden behind three-or four-letter pseudonyms connected to their cryptocurrency wallets -- and appear to be located outside the United States. At least 20 of the top 25 investors appear to be foreign-based, according to analysis from the left-leaning nonprofit research group Accountable.US.",
      "Among those who attended are an Australian entrepreneur, a New York-based crypto enthusiast, and Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto mogul who has brokered deep business ties with the Trump family. In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in $TRUMP, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",

      "Thursday's gala plays out against the backdrop of a fight in Congress over the first major legislation to regulate certain types of cryptocurrencies, called the GENIUS Act.

We've seen a little bit from special elections that Democratic voters are motivated to turn out. Does that continue going forward in the fall in New Jersey?\" Daniel Bowen, a political science professor at The College of New Jersey, told ABC News.",
      "Brigid Callahan Harrison, the chair of the Political Science and Law Department at Montclair State University, told ABC News that the race might not only be a \"bellwether\" for how voters feel about President Donald Trump and the upcoming midterms, but that it could indicate both how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.",
      "Harrison points to Kamala Harris' small margin of victory in New Jersey, too. Harris won New Jersey by around 6 percentage points in 2024; then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020.",
      "At stake in the race are also issues in New Jersey such as immigration enforcement and sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing and general affordability -- issues that have divided and animated Americans around the country and that are set to take center stage in the midterms as well.",

      "Another Democratic candidate, Josh Gottheimer, has represented New Jersey's 5th Congressional District since 2017. The former political operative is widely seen as a moderate.

The president urged the graduating cadets to \u201cnever forget\u201d the soldiers who fought a war over slavery during his remarks, which came as the nation was reckoning with its history on race after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "Trump also paid tribute to the military academy\u2019s history and its famed graduates, including Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The ceremony five years ago drew scrutiny because the Military Academy forced the graduating cadets, who had been home because of COVID-19, to return to an area near a pandemic hot spot.",
      "Trump traveled to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, earlier this month to speak to the University of Alabama\u2019s graduating class. His remarks mixed standard commencement fare and advice with political attacks against predecessor Joe Biden, musings about transgender athletes and lies about the 2020 election.",
      "On Friday, Vice President JD Vance spoke to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Vance said in his remarks that Trump is working to ensure U.S. soldiers are deployed with clear goals rather than the \u201cundefined missions\u201d and \u201copen-ended conflicts\u201d of the past.",

      "Speaker Mike Johnson was rushing through the halls of the Capitol during the overnight House vote on President Donald Trump's big tax bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- It was just past 3 a.m., a few hours before the House vote on President Donald Trump's top priority in Congress, his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson was rushing through the Capitol halls with his security guards and aides in tow. For a moment, he paused.",
      "Would you like to see the prayer room? he asked an Associated Press reporter.",
      "The question was in response to another question about his leadership style: whether his religion, his Christian faith, had been guiding him through the tumultuous process.",
      "\u201cThis is like a cathedral at night,\u201d he said, walking toward an almost-hidden door. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing in the Capitol.\u201d",
      "He punched in the key code and stepped inside.",
      "The room, transformed in the 1950s, sits just off the suite of second-floor offices of the House speaker, centered in the Capitol, on its west end closest to the National Mall.",
      "\u201cBeen here a lot this week, right there on my knees,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJust praying. ... That\u2019s what the founders did.\u201d",
      "As Wednesday night had melted into Thursday morning, none other than George Washington, the first president himself, watched over the room, his tall figure bent on one knee in the stained-glass image high above a small altar.",
      "\u201cIn times of great challenge, they got on their knees and they sought divine guidance, and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d Johnson was saying. \u201cBecause I\u2019m convinced that God\u2019s given us a chance to save this great republic.\u201d",
      "Johnson is a conservative Christian and among the more outwardly religious of House speakers. He was an accidental choice to lead Republicans, selected after his GOP colleagues ousted their previous speaker almost two years ago. When Johnson emerged as the pick, Republicans gathered around him and prayed. He considers himself a \u201cservant\u201d leader.",
      "Determined to push Trump\u2019s bill to House passage, the speaker set his intention. He created a self-imposed deadline, Memorial Day, that seemed overly optimistic. And he just kept moving forward, despite robust opposition from Democrats and skeptics within his own GOP ranks.",
      "As the deadline neared, he did not let up. He prayed.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have sort of a vision of where we\u2019re supposed to go, and you just set the course and you just patiently get everybody there,\u201d he explained.",
      "The speaker is sometimes in a question-answering mood. A conversation unfolded.",
      "Aren\u2019t you afraid of flopping? he was asked.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really have fear,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I know that we have to accomplish this mission in order to save the country.\u201d",
      "The speaker was explaining how this is \u201cthe greatest nation\" and his own belief in its \"foundational principles.\u201d",
      "\"And what I think we're trying to do here is restore them,\u201d he said. \u201cPiece by piece, that\u2019s what we do here every day.\u201d",
      "But your legislation is being criticized, hammered for doing so many things. People will lose access to Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "The Congressional Budget office estimates that under proposals in the bill, some 8.6 million people will no longer have health care, and 3 million a month will stop receiving the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re counting the people the work requirements are going to apply to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would be, would be choosing, you know, not to work.\u201d",
      "But some of the people \u2014 particularly older, single men \u2014 may not be able to find work or go back to work.",
      "The new 80-hours-a-month work requirements or community service would be for able-bodied adults without dependents through age 64, with various exceptions. Some parents of children older than 7 would also need to fulfill the work requirement to receive SNAP food stamp assistance.",
      "\u201cWe have finite resources,\" he said. \"So the vulnerable populations are who we\u2019re trying to take care of.\u201d",
      "Do you worry that\u2019s counter to your own beliefs?",
      "\u201cWe are helping people,\u201d he said. For an able-bodied man to work, \"it's good for his own personal dignity. It's good for his purpose. It's a win-win-win.\"",
      "The debates in Congress come during a time of great soul-searching in the United States and the world. People are divided as ever, politically and economically, yet also yearning for a sense of community and togetherness that seems to be slipping further out of reach.",
      "House Democrats, who have fought Johnson and his party every step of the way in opposing what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill,\u201d were not about to cede any moral ground to Republicans or to Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is the United States of America \u2014 the wealthiest country in the history of the world. It is indecent to rip food out of the mouths of children and everyday Americans,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during his own lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote.",
      "Before invoking the Gospel of Matthew 25:35-40, Jeffries said Congress could do better than this \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d bill.",
      "\u201cI do believe that there are people of faith on both sides of this chamber,\u201d said Jeffries, of New York.",
      "\u201cJesus talks about the importance of standing up for the least, the lost, the left behind, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the homeless, the people who are confined, strangers in a foreign land,\" he said. \u201cIt cannot be the case that one goes to synagogue or goes to the mosque \u2014 or one goes to church, as I do \u2014 but one goes to church to pray on Sunday and then comes to Washington, D.C., to prey on the American people the rest of the week.\"",
      "All of that would come hours later, spoken as the bill was on its unstoppable path toward passage. For now, at this late moment, Johnson's reflections were drawing to an end. He was shutting the prayer room door behind him.",
      "So how did you do it? How did you get your Republicans to fall in line?",
      "\u201cJust a lot of patience,\" Johnson said.",
      "What about your meetings with Trump at the White House?",
      "That would be for another day, he indicated. With the room closed, the speaker of the House had shared the keycode so others could seek out prayer in the Capitol if needed. He headed around the corner, through the side halls of the Capitol, back to his office.",

      "A federal judge has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board.",
      "In a seven-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell said the government did not meet any of the four requirements for a stay, including a \u201cstrong showing\u201d of whether its request could succeed on the merits.",
      "Howell reiterated her finding that the Institute is not part of the executive branch and is therefore beyond President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to fire its board. She added that the firings also did not follow the law for how a board member of the Institute might be removed by the president.",
      "Most of the board was fired in March during a takeover of the Institute by the Department of Government Efficiency. That action touched off the firing of its acting president, former ambassador George Moose, and subsequently most of the staff. The organization's headquarters, funded in part by donors, was turned over to the General Services Administration.",
      "In her ruling May 19, Howell concluded that the board was fired illegally and all actions that followed that were therefore \u201cnull and void.\u201d",
      "In Friday's ruling Howell also rejected the government\u2019s argument that the organization had to fall into one of the three branches of government and since it does not legislate, nor is it part of the judicial branch, it must be part of the executive branch. \u201cAs the Court has previously pointed out, other entities also fall outside of this tripartite structure,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Howell also said that the government did not \u201cdescribe any cognizable harm they will experience without a stay, let alone an irreparable one.\u201d However, \u201cas plaintiffs explain, every day that goes by without the relief this Court ordered, the job of putting (USIP) back together by rehiring employees and stemming the dissipation of USIP\u2019s goodwill and reputation for independence will become that much harder.\u201d",
      "Moose reentered the headquarters Wednesday without incident along with the organization's outside counsel, George Foote.",
      "The White House was not immediately available for comment. In requesting the stay the government also requested a two-business-day stay to allow for an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Howell denied that request.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered further restrictions on how the press operates at the Pentagon",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered further restrictions on how the press operates at the Pentagon",
      "Bedeviled by leaks to the media during his short tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a series of restrictions on the press late Friday that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort \u2014 areas where the press has had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military.",
      "Newly restricted areas include his office and those of his top aides and all of the different locations across the mammoth building where the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Space Force maintain press offices.",
      "The media will also be barred from offices of the Pentagon's senior military leadership, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, without Hegseth's approval and an escort from his aides. The staff of the Joint Chiefs has traditionally maintained a good relationship with the press.",
      "Hegseth, the former Fox News Channel personality, issued his order via a posting on X late on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend. He said it was necessary for national security.",
      "\u201cWhile the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence information) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger,\u201d wrote Hegseth.",
      "The Pentagon Press Association expressed skepticism that operational concerns were at play \u2014 and linked the move to previous actions by Hegseth\u2019s office that impede journalists and their coverage.",
      "\u201cThere is no way to sugarcoat it. Today\u2019s memo by Secretary Hegseth appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America\u2019s right to know what its military is doing,\u201d it said in a statement Friday night. \u201cThe Pentagon Press Association is extremely concerned by the decision to restrict movement of accredited journalists within the Pentagon through non-secured, unclassified hallways.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also said reporters will be required to sign a form to protect sensitive information and would be issued a new badge that more clearly identifies them as press. It was not clear whether signing the form would be a condition of continued access to the building.",
      "Two months ago, the department was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on President Donald Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out.",
      "The Pentagon was also embarrassed when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently included in a group chat on the Signal messaging app where Hegseth discussed plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job.",
      "The administration has taken several aggressive actions toward the press since Trump took over, including FCC investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. Restrictions imposed on The Associated Press' access to certain White House events earlier this year led to a court battle that is ongoing.",
      "The White House has also increased access for conservative media that are friendly to the president. Nevertheless, a study released earlier this month found that Trump had more frequent exchanges with reporters during his first 100 days in office than any of his six predecessors.",
      "Hegseth, however, has been far less available. He has yet to speak to the press in the Pentagon briefing room. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has held only one Pentagon press briefing since Jan. 20. The Pentagon has taken other steps to make it more difficult for reporters, including taking office space away from eight media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC.",

      "On the same day of last month's proclamation allowing commercial fishing in the monument, Trump issued an order to boost the U.S. commercial fishing industry by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas.",
      "The monument was created by President George W. Bush in 2009 and consists of about 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) in the central Pacific Ocean. President Barack Obama expanded the monument in 2014.",
      "A week after the April 17 proclamation, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them a green light to fish commercially within the monument's boundaries, even though a long-standing fishing ban remains on the books, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Honolulu.",
      "The first longline fisher started fishing in the monument just three days after that letter, according to Earthjustice, which has been tracking vessel activity within the monument using Global Fishing Watch.",
      "The Department of Justice declined to comment Friday.",
      "The lawsuit noted that commercial longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) or longer, will snag turtles, marine mammals or seabirds that are attracted to the bait or swim through the curtain of hooks.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as the Trump administration unleashes highly destructive commercial fishing on some of the planet\u2019s most pristine, biodiverse marine environments,\u201d David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. \u201cPiling lawlessness on top of lawlessness, the National Marine Fisheries Service chose to carry out President Trump\u2019s illegal proclamation by issuing its own illegal directive, with no public input.\u201d",
      "Designating the area in the Pacific Ocean to the south and west of the Hawaiian islands as a monument provided \u201cneeded protection to a wide variety of scientific and historical treasures in one of the most spectacular and unique ocean ecosystems on earth,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit added that allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion harms the \u201ccultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests\u201d of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.",

      "BACKSTORY: Springsteen revisits the theme of a dying hometown, this time with more aggressiveness than lament, keying in on the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It functioned as a protest song and a rallying cry against greed and its carriers. The same album featured the song \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d a defiant challenge to people who would tear down beloved parts of northern New Jersey in the name of \u201cprogress.\u201d",

      "LYRIC: \"So I bought a .44 Magnum, it was solid steel cast. And in the blessed name of Elvis, well, I just let it blast \u2018til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet. And they busted me for disturbin\u2019 the almighty peace.\u201d",
      "YEAR/ALBUM: 1992, \u201cHuman Touch\u201d",
      "BACKSTORY: An expression of sardonic rage at the emptiness and hopelessness that the unremitting feed of cable TV had brought to the world. This is less political and more social, though it reflected some of the disillusionment of the age about the brain rot of popular culture. It came months before Michael Douglas\u2019 anger-management-failure movie \u201cFalling Down\u201d depicted an enraged man losing it and tearing a swath through Los Angeles because of the stresses of modern culture.",

      "YEAR/ALBUM: 2007, \u201cMagic\u201d",
      "BACKSTORY: A twist on the old-fashioned warning song, written from the vantage point of the future. (\"We're livin' in the future, and none of this has happened yet.\") This was a commentary on a post-9/11 America that \u2014 as the song suggests \u2014 is headed in a bad direction. Oblique but devastating, particularly with such somber words against an upbeat melody reminiscent of his early work, it suggested there was still time to correct course. Which touches on a frequent Springsteen theme: possibility amid the hardship and challenge.",

When suspicion later turned toward Worrell's husband, he fled the U.S. to live in Costa Rica with the couple's live-in nanny.",

      "\u201cYou can get what you want in here,\u201d an inmate boasted without a supervisor in sight. \u201cMedication. Pills. Drugs. Heroin.\u201d",
      "The jaw-dropping footage fueled a sweeping 2013 court order intended to reform one of the most violent jails in the country \u2014 a decaying emblem of the crime and corruption that have long plagued New Orleans.",
      "A dozen years and tens of millions of dollars later, much of that makeover remains an aspiration despite oversight from a federal judge and the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "The city\u2019s correctional chaos reached a new nadir last week when a lone civilian guard monitoring the facility stepped away to get food, allowing 10 inmates to yank open a faulty cell door, remove a toilet and escape through a hole in the wall where steel bars had been cut away. No one noticed the men scaling a fence and sprinting across an interstate around 1 a.m. Hours passed before the public or even law enforcement was notified.",
      "Five of the fugitives remained on the loose Friday as some 200 federal, state and local officers searched for them.",
      "The dysfunction dates back generations and continued even after the 2015 opening of the state-of-the-art Orleans Justice Center, billed as a $150 million panacea when it replaced its seemingly-cursed predecessor. There were major issues with the building from the outset, including a lack of supervision and adequate housing for mentally ill inmates.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019ve got a jail with 900 cameras, but that\u2019s cold comfort if no one is watching them,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a New Orleans-based watchdog group.",
      "\u201cThe inmates-gone-wild videos from years back don\u2019t even approach this,\" Goyeneche added. \u201cIf the sheriff or anyone was thinking about terminating the jail consent decree, this escape has ended any serious discussion about that.\"",
      "Conditions for catastrophe had been ripe for months. An independent jail monitor warned of \u201cextremely inadequate\u201d staffing levels and dangerously lax supervision \u2014 both factors in a jailbreak that exposed figurative and literal holes in security. At the same time, court records show the number of \u201cinternal escapes\" within the jail has skyrocketed over the past two years, underscoring jailers' inability to govern the nearly 1,400-inmate population.",
      "\u201cToo often the failure to follow policy is blamed on the lack of staff or training,\u201d the monitors wrote in a report. \u201cNeither is an acceptable excuse.\u201d",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson initially deflected blame for the jailbreak, implying without evidence that it was politically motivated as she runs for reelection. Appearing before the City Council several days later, she accepted \u201cfull accountability\u201d for the \u201cfailures.\u201d",
      "She told the City Council she needs millions of dollars to fix \u201coutdated surveillance, aging infrastructure, blind spots in supervision and critical staffing shortages.\u201d The council pushed back, saying the jail had received substantial injections of taxpayer dollars without sufficient oversight.",
      "Perhaps most startlingly, Hutson warned she \u201ccannot guarantee\u201d inmates would not be left unattended in the future.",
      "\u201cThe jail is the same today as it was a week ago, the same as when we submitted our 2024 budget request, and the same as it has been for years,\u201d Hutson said in a statement.",
      "The escape has drawn new attention to deplorable jail conditions that have persisted for decades in New Orleans, a history of neglect that stands out even in a state long associated with overincarceration. The situation became so dire in 2016 that Hutson's predecessor, Marlin Gusman, was stripped of control of the jail as part of a deal to avert federal receivership.",
      "\u201cI think it's gotten worse,\u201d said Ricky Peterson, who recalled inmates roaming the facility \u201cat their own leisure\u201d when he was jailed about a decade ago.",
      "\u201cAs time progressed, it started going down and down and down,\u201d added Mario Westbrook, 48, who was jailed around the same time on gun possession and marijuana charges. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to go through those type of conditions.\u201d",
      "In 1970, a federal judge declared the overcrowded Orleans Parish Prison to be unconstitutional, saying conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and \u201cshock the conscience as a matter of elemental decency.\u201d A later lawsuit alleged that female inmates were shackled during childbirth. Suicides and in-custody deaths abounded, including the fatal beating of a man by two deputies in 2004.",
      "Then as now, the sheriff accused the city of chronically underfunding the jail, while city officials countered the lockup was most afflicted by incompetent management.",
      "Hurricane Katrina in 2005 wrought unspeakable havoc at the jail, as inmates found themselves stranded in chest-high water and the lockup lost power.",
      "A 2009 Justice Department report warned of \u201ccalculated abuse\u201d by deputies who would beat inmates so frequently they developed a code of ordering an inmate to \u201ctie his shoes\u201d when they wanted to brawl.",
      "A major landmark came in 2013 when a class-action lawsuit resulted in the consent decree, a detailed plan for overhauling jail policies, reducing violence and improving inmate medical treatment.",
      "That litigation unearthed the viral jailhouse videos, which also included a 2009 clip of an apparently escaped inmate cavorting on the city's famed Bourbon Street for what the Justice Department described as \u201can evening of leisure.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe conduct in the video may have occurred several years ago,\u201d the Justice Department said at the time, \u201cbut the policies, practices and culture that enabled the outrageous conduct remain relevant.\u201d",

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Vice President JD Vance told military academy graduates Friday that President Donald Trump is working to ensure that U.S. armed forces are only sent into harm\u2019s way with clear goals rather than the \u201cundefined missions\u201d and \u201copen-ended conflicts\u201d of the past.",

      "Vance, in his first remarks as vice president to one of the military service academies, also spoke briefly about his own military service as he addressed the 1,049 graduates in Annapolis' class of 2025, most of them newly commissioned ensigns and second lieutenants.",
      "The Ohio native enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and served four years, doing a tour in Iraq and working as a military journalist.",
      "Vance appeared to criticize the Iraq War as he spoke of Trump\u2019s shift in approach, seeming to refer to the mission he served in when he said: \u201cHow hard could it be to build a few democracies in the Middle East? Well, almost impossibly hard, it turns out. And unbelievably costly.\u201d",
      "Vance also criticized a Biden administration effort to build a pier in Gaza to accept aid in Israel\u2019s war with Hamas there, which he suggested never worked.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration has reversed course,\" Vance said. \"No more undefined missions. No more open-ended conflicts.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cWe ought to be cautious in deciding to throw a punch, but when we throw a punch, we throw a punch hard, and we do it decisively. And that\u2019s exactly what we may ask you to do.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead to Memorial Day, the vice president noted \u201cit is not a happy day\u201d and is \u201cnot for those who served and came home. It is for those who served and didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery Memorial Day, I think about a graduate of this institution, Major Megan McClung,\u201d Vance said. \u201cShe was an officer I served with who was bright, tough and incredibly dedicated to her job.\u201d He said McClung arrived in Iraq not long before he did and was killed not long after that.",

      "McClung, 34, was a military relations officer who was killed by a roadside bomb in Ramadi in December 2006. She was the first female Marine officer to be killed in the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the first female Naval Academy graduate killed in action.",
      "Vance served in the Marines and when he was named Trump\u2019s running mate last year, he became the first veteran to serve on a major party presidential ticket since John McCain in 2008. Former President George W. Bush, who left office in 2009, was the last sitting president who had served in the military.",

      "Unhappy that Apple intends to source nearly all of its U.S. iPhones from India, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on the popular device unless the tech giant moves production to the United States",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Unhappy that Apple intends to source nearly all of its U.S. iPhones from India, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on the popular device unless the tech giant moves production to the United States. But Apple has seen little incentive in the past to manufacture domestically.",
      "Apple has traditionally produced its devices in China, in massive factories that rely on a vast network of local suppliers. The company's reliance on this relationship thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "In response to the president's recent exchange with China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would, if made in America, jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S. Combined with current economic forces, the price of an iPhone could triple, threatening to torpedo sales of Apple's marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a nonstarter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. On a quarterly earnings call earlier in May, Cook told investors that tariffs had a \u201climited impact\u201d on the company in the March quarter because it was able to optimize its supply chain. But Cook warned that it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to predict beyond June \u201cbecause I\u2019m not sure what will happen with tariffs.\u201d",
      "Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of Trump's escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS News program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that tour, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Thursday curtailing what kind of development can happen in Florida\u2019s prized state parks",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Thursday curtailing what kind of development can happen in Florida\u2019s prized state parks \u2014 giving his approval to legislation that came in direct response to his administration\u2019s push to build golf courses, pickleball courts and hotels on conservation lands.",
      "Unlike issues of abortion, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, race and guns that have divided voters, state parks apparently hold a place in the hearts of Floridians regardless of party.",
      "The development plans drew widespread, bipartisan backlash last summer. Hundreds of nature lovers and conservationists thronged to protests at parks across the state, carrying signs with slogans like \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave\u201d and \u201cParks Over Profit.\u201d",
      "The law, which goes into effect July 1, was unanimously approved by both chambers of Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature. It specifically bans the construction of golf courses, ball fields and sports facilities in state parks, and requires government officials to give Floridians at least 30 days\u2019 notice ahead of public hearings to discuss proposed changes to the conservation areas.",
      "The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "DeSantis signed the law days after another wave of bipartisan backlash scuttled a company's plans to swap some its properties for state-owned conservation lands.",
      "Organizers for the environmental group Sierra Club Florida called the state park law a monumental victory for grassroots activism in a politically divided state.",
      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a turning point not just for our environment, but for the future of Florida,\u201d said Javier Estevez, the group's political and legislative director.",
      "The bipartisan push to rein in DeSantis\u2019 administration is a sign of how the governor's once rock-solid support from fellow Republicans has eroded. Until recently, it was rare for DeSantis to get pushback on anything from the GOP lawmakers who dominate the state\u2019s politics, and he has a reputation for seeking vengeance when they do.",
      "But it appears a political line in the sand has been drawn around Florida\u2019s beloved state parks, which are a bastion of wildness in a state where vast stretches of white-sand beaches and mangrove forests have long given way to high rise condos, roadside motels and strip mall souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThis bill really provides safeguards and protections to our state parks,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Gayle Harrell, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, adding there is \u201cno wiggle room\u201d for unwanted development.",
      "Harrell\u2019s South Florida district includes Jonathan Dickinson State Park, where DeSantis\u2019 Department of Environmental Protection had proposed building a golf complex. That would have entailed removing a boardwalk and observation tower and relocating the residences and offices of park staff, as well as existing cabins for visitors.",
      "Harrell said last summer's widespread protests pushed the issue to the forefront of the legislative agenda.",
      "\u201cIt took the entire state of Florida to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is democracy at work.\u201d",
      "Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, declared the law's passage a \u201chuge win\u201d over the state\u2019s powerful development interests.",
      "\u201cPeople really want to build golf courses on some of our more protected lands in the state. Instead, we made it (the protections) stronger,\u201d Samples said. \u201cWe did this. All of us did this together.\u201d",
      "The Republican governor has distanced himself from the development proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land.",
      "The DeSantis-appointed environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intense scrutiny and bipartisan pushback on the initiative. In November, DeSantis tapped a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

      "A former Philadelphia police officer who shot and killed a motorist during a traffic stop has been acquitted of murder charges",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- A former Philadelphia police officer who shot and killed a motorist during a traffic stop has been acquitted of murder charges by a jury that did convict him of voluntary manslaughter and related counts.",
      "Mark Dial could face up to six years in prison when he's sentenced in July. The verdict came Thursday afternoon after the jury had deliberated for nearly three days.",
      "The charges against Dial stemmed from an August 2023 traffic stop involving Eddie Irizarry, 27, who Dial fatally shot as he sat in his car. Police body camera footage showed Irizarry holding a knife near his right leg as police approached, and another officer yelled \u201cknife\u201d as they got near the vehicle.",
      "During the trial, Dial's attorneys disputed those assertions, saying the other officer yelled \u201cGun!\u201d They also argued the seven-inch knife Irizarry was holding resembled a gun, saying Dial acted lawfully and in self-defense.",
      "Following the verdict, Dial's attorneys said they were glad he was acquitted of murder but disappointed he was convicted of anything. Besides the voluntary manslaughter count, Dial also was convicted of reckless endangerment and possessing an instrument of crime.",
      "Prosecutors declined comment.",
      "The verdict culminates a series of legal twists and turns in the case, which has seen the charges filed, thrown out, refiled and later reduced.",

    "story": [
      "Retired firefighter Mark Whaling knows firsthand what it\u2019s like to wait on a helicopter to refill on water while he's battling a blaze on the ground",
      "CABAZON, Calif. -- Mark Whaling and a crew raced up and down a hill in a tanker truck as they battled a wildfire in Los Angeles County, scrambling to get water from a street hydrant in time to stay ahead of flames moving up a ridge. A helicopter flew in to drop water, but it had to fly a long distance to refill \u2014 and a fire that might have been stopped went on to destroy homes.",
      "As they fought that early 2000s blaze, Whaling says, he spotted a sealed, million-gallon water tank nearby that firefighters had no way of accessing. He thought that was ridiculous.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t tell fire engines, \u2018Protect the city and go find your own water.\u2019 We put fire hydrants every 600 feet all around cities,\u201d said Whaling, who has since retired from the county fire department. \u201cBut when it comes to the helicopters, we weren\u2019t supporting them as robustly as we should.\u201d",
      "His frustration sparked an idea: the Heli-Hydrant, a relatively small, open tank that can be rapidly filled with water, enabling helicopters to fill up faster for urban fires rather than flying to sometimes distant lakes or ponds.",
      "As wildfires become more frequent, Whaling's invention is getting the attention of officials eager to boost preparedness. First used for the 2020 Blue Ridge Fire in Yorba Linda, 10 Heli-Hydrants have been built across Southern California and 16 more are in progress, according to Whaling.",
      "Helicopters are essential for firefighting. They can drop 1,000 gallons (about 3,785 liters) of water at once \u2014 some much more. That's far more than hoses than get on a fire all at once, and can be the best way to attack fires that are difficult for ground crews to reach.",
      "But pilots sometimes have to fly a long way to scoop up water, and in drought-prone areas, natural sources can sometimes dry up or diminish so they're hard to draw from. In Southern California's Riverside County, helicopters have had to fly up to 10 miles (about 16 kilometers) to find water, eating critical time from battling fires.",
      "On a remote plot in the Southern California town of Cabazon, contractor Glenn Chavez stood on a ladder and peered into an empty Heli-Hydrant. A radio in hand, he clicked a button to activate the system and watched as water roared into the tank. In about six minutes, it filled with 8,500 gallons (32,176 liters).",
      "Chavez, a general contractor, was testing the Cabazon Water District\u2019s lastest investment \u2014 a second Heli-Hydrant that local officials are counting on to help protect the town. At $300,000, it cost slightly less than the average price of a single home in Cabazon.",
      "\u201cLiving in a beautiful desert community, you're going to have risks of fire,\" said Michael Pollack, the district's general manager. \"And to have these Heli-Hydrants is a major advantage. People will have a little bit of comfort knowing that they have another tool for fighting fires in their community.\"",
      "Pilots can remotely activate the tanks from half a mile away, with the tank typically filling quickly from a city's water system. Helicopters can fill up in less than a minute. Once it's activated, solar panels and backup batteries ensure the system can still be used during power outages. And at night, lights from the tank and a tower nearby guide pilots toward it.",
      "In November, fire responders in San Diego put the product to the test when the 48-acre Garden Fire in Fallbrook, a community known for its avocado groves, prompted evacuation orders and warnings. Helicopters tapped the tank nearly 40 times.",
      "Pilot Ben Brown said its proximity to the fire saved not just time but fuel.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re great for when you don\u2019t have other water sources,\u201d he said. \"The more dip sites, especially in some of the more arid environments in the county, the better.\u201d",
      "Heli-Hydrants have raised some concerns about their placement in urban areas where houses, buildings and power lines can be obstacles to flight and they might have to squeeze into tighter spaces.",
      "In those cases, firefighters may choose to fly farther to a natural source that gives the helicopter more room, said Warren Voth, a deputy pilot with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. A pilot's goal is to always to face the wind while entering and exiting an area, for safety, and they need room to accomplish that.",
      "In some cases, the municipal systems needed to fill Heli-Hydrants could go empty during major fires. As the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles burned, three 1-million gallon tanks that helped pressurize city hydrants in the Pacific Palisades ran dry as demand soared and burning pipes leaked water.",
      "Other times, helicopters just can't access them. When winds are fierce, flying is nearly impossible; hurricane-force winds that supercharged the Los Angeles infernos initially grounded firefighting aircraft. When multiple helicopters respond to large blazes, they can't all use the Heli-Hydrant. And smoke can make it hard to see it.",
      "Portable water tanks can accomplish some of the things that Heli-Hydrants do, but can require time, people and equipment to set up.",
      "Areas where wildland vegetation intersects with human development have always been vulnerable to fires, but more people are living in them today, and climate change is creating conditions that can make these regions drier and more flammable.",
      "Jake Wiley has seen intensifying wildfires devastate his community. Two blazes \u2014 in 2007 and 2017 \u2014 collectively scorched more than 400 structures in San Diego. The last one forced Wiley, now general manager for the Rainbow Municipal Water District, to evacuate.",
      "That fire also prompted local agencies to install a Heli-Hydrant \u2014 and when the Garden Fire erupted in November, it played a big role helping firefighters protect homes.",
      "\u201cIt seems like when you've seen the worst, you haven't yet,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cAnything we can do helps.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-",

      "The finding was announced late Thursday by the Health and Human Services Department, marking the latest blow for an Ivy League school already shaken by federal cutbacks and sustained government pressure to crack down on student speech.",
      "It comes hours after the Department of Homeland Security said it would revoke Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, a major escalation in the administration\u2019s monthslong attack on higher education.",

That final category, the press release notes, includes \u201cdiscrimination against individuals that is based on their actual or perceived Israeli or Jewish identity or ancestry.\u201d",
      "The announcement did not include new sanctions against Columbia, which is already facing $400 million in federal cuts by the Trump administration over its response to pro-Palestinian campus protests.",

      "\u201cWe understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cColumbia is deeply committed to combatting antisemitism and all forms of harassment and discrimination on our campus.\u201d",
      "The civil rights investigation into Columbia was based on witness interviews, media reports and other sources, according to HHS. The findings were not made public. A spokesperson did not response to a request for further information.",
      "\u201cThe findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,\u201d Anthony Archeval, acting director of the HHS civil rights office, said in a statement.",
      "Last spring, Columbia became the epicenter of protests against the war in Gaza, spurring a national movement of campus demonstrations that demanded universities cut ties with Israel.",
      "At the time, some Jewish students and faculty complained about being harassed during the demonstrations or ostracized because of their faith or their support of Israel.",
      "Those who participated in Columbia\u2019s protests, including some Jewish students, have said they are protesting Israel\u2019s actions against Palestinians and have forcefully denied allegations of antisemitism.",
      "Many have also accused the university of capitulating to the Trump administration's demands \u2014 including placing its Middle East studies department under new leadership \u2014 at the expense of academic freedom and protecting foreign students.",
      "At a commencement ceremony earlier this week, a speech by Columbia's acting president, Claire Shipman, was met with loud boos by graduates and chants of \u201cfree Palestine.\"",

      "The iconic singer announced\u00a0Friday he was diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, which has been exacerbated by recent performances, leading to problems with his hearing, vision and balance.",
      "\"I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding,\" Joel said in a statement.",

      "In the meantime, Joel is looking forward to when he can return to the stage, the statement said.",
      "Fans who had purchased tickets to an upcoming performance will be automatically refunded, according to the statement.",
      "Joel had been scheduled to perform in Milwaukee in April, but that show was postponed. He was set to kick off a series of performances starting in July in Pittsburgh.",

      "Legendary musicians Stevie Nicks, Rod Stewart and Sting were expected to join Joel at different points on the tour.",
      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spinal cord, is the type of fluid that builds up. Typically, your body makes just enough of this fluid each day and absorbs that same amount, according to Johns Hopkins, but sometimes too much fluid can build up, leading to NPH.",
      "\"If that increases abnormally, it can build up in these chambers, called ventricles, in the brain,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained. \"And that can cause pressure on normal brain tissue.\"",
      "As a result, he said, people with the condition may experience symptoms including \"trouble thinking, trouble walking and trouble with urinary incontinence,\" though not every patient will have all the same symptoms.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" LaPook said.",
      "An MRI brain scan can detect the issue, and medical experts say it is usually treatable. The treatment typically involves a surgical procedure to implant a shunt in order to drain the fluid. LaPook said he recently had a patient who was treated this way, \"and now he's feeling perfectly fine.\"",
      "The condition is relatively uncommon, but is more likely to occur in older people.",
      "According to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic, NPH affects bout 0.2% of people between the ages 70 and 80, and about 5.9% of those over 80.",

      "Paris \u2014 After a monthlong trial, eight of the 10 people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian\u00a0in Paris in 2016 were convicted on Friday.",
      "The ringleader and seven other people involved in the heist were found guilty, but will not return to prison. The court acquitted two defendants who were accused of handing out information about Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, the ringleader, was handed the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment. Five of those years are a suspended sentence. Due to time already served in jail, he will not return to detention.",
      "Three others who were accused of the most serious charges \u2014 Yunis Abbas, Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexandre Boyer \u2014 each got seven years, five of them suspended. Like Khedache, they will not return to detention. Dubreucq, 69, was absent from the sentencing as he is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Prosecutors had called for the four to face 10-year sentences. The chief judge, David De Pas, said the ages of the defendants \u2014 the oldest is 79 and some others are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences that would have sent them to jail. Boyer, 35, is the only young person involved in the crime.",
      "\"It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening,\" De Pas said. He said the nine years between the robbery and the trial were also taken into account in the sentencing.",
      "Still, he said that Kardashian had been traumatized by the robbery in her hotel.",
      "\"You caused harm, even if you didn't strike physically and blood was not spilt,\" De Pas said. \"You caused fear.\"",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who was not present for the sentencing, said in a statement that she was \"deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice\" in the case. In court, lawyers for Kardashian said the reality star was \"satisfied\" with the verdict.",
      "\"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\" she said in her statement. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.\"",
      "The 10 accused have been known in France as les papys braqueurs, or the \"Grandpa robbers,\" because of their ages. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and Khedache, now deaf and largely mute, leaned on a cane. Khedache and Abbas, who previously admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court before their sentencing and conviction.",
      "In a scribbled note to the court, Khedache offered \"a thousand apologies.\" He also apologized to his son, Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, who was a driver for the gang that night. Khedache's DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anne Tyler's latest novel, the New York Times bestseller \"Three Days in June\" (Knopf), details a long weekend in the life of a divorced school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding.",

      "The clock gathered itself together with a whirring of gears and struck a series of blurry notes. Nine o'clock, I was thinking; but no, it turned out to be ten. I'd been sitting there in a sort of stupor, evidently. I stood up and hung my purse in the closet, but then outside the window I saw some movement on the other side of the curtain, some dark and ponderous shape laboring up my front walk. I tweaked the curtain aside a half inch. Max, for God's sake. Max with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder, and a bulky square suitcase dangling from his left hand.",
      "I went to the front door and opened it and looked out at him through the screen. \"What on earth?\" I asked him.",
      "\"You're home!\" he said.",
      "\"Yes ...\"",
      "\"Debbie is at something called a Day of Beauty.\"",
      "\"Right,\" I said.",
      "\"But she knew ahead I was coming. I told her I was coming. I get there and no one's home. I call her cell phone and she says she didn't expect me so early.\"",
      "\"Why did you come so early?\" I asked him.",
      "\"I wanted to beat the rush. You know what Fridays are like on the Bay Bridge.\"",
      "All the more reason not to live on the other side of it, I could have pointed out. I opened the screen door for him and reached for his suitcase, but it wasn't a suitcase; it was some kind of animal carrier. Square patch of wire grid on the end and something watchful and alert staring out from behind it gleaming-eyed. Max moved the carrier away from me a bit and said, \"I've got it.\"",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"It's a cat.\"",
      "\"A cat!\"",
      "\"Could I come in, do you think?\"",
      "I retreated and he lumbered in, out of breath, shaking the floorboards. Max was nowhere near fat, but he was weighty, broad shouldered; he always gave the impression of taking up more than his share of room, although he was not much taller than I was. In the years since we'd divorced he had grown the kind of beard that you're not quite sure is deliberate; maybe he'd merely forgotten to shave for a while. A short gray frizzle with a frizzle of gray hair to match, and he seemed to have given up on his clothes; generally he wore stretched-out knit tops and baggy khakis. I hoped he'd brought a suit for the wedding. You never could be sure.",
      "\"Couldn't you have just left your cat at home with food and water?\" I asked, following him through the living room. \"I mean, it's already bad enough that you're staying with Debbie yourself. In the middle of her wedding preparations, for God's sake!\"",
      "\"She said it would be fine if I stayed,\" Max told me. \"She said it wasn't a problem.\"",
      "\"Okay, but then to add a cat to the mix ... Cats do very well on their own. They almost prefer it, in fact.\"",
      "\"Not this one,\" he said. He set the carrier on my kitchen counter. \"This one is too new.\"",
      "\"It's a kitten?\"",
      "\"No, no, it's old.\"",
      "\"You just said\u2014\"",
      "\"It's an elderly female cat who belonged to a very old woman, and now the woman has up and died and the cat is in mourning,\" he told me.",
      "There was a lot I could have asked about this, but it didn't seem worth the effort. I leaned closer to peer at the cat. \"Does Debbie know you're bringing it?\" I asked him.",
      "\"Now she does.\"",
      "I waited.",
      "\"It's complicated,\" he said. He blotted his face on his shoulder. \"I phoned her; I said, 'Where are you?' She says she's at a Day of Beauty. 'Did you leave a key out someplace?' I asked her, and she says no, but she'll be home in a few hours. 'A few hours!' I say. 'I can't wait a few hours! I've got a cat here!' She says, 'A what?' Then she hits the roof. Tells me I can in no way bring a cat to her house, because Kenneth is allergic.\"",
      "\"He is?\" I said.",
      "\"Deathly allergic, is how she put it.\"",
      "\"But ... Kenneth doesn't live there,\" I said.",
      "\"Don't kid yourself,\" Max told me. \"You know he stays over a lot, and besides, he does plan to live there after the wedding.\"",
      "\"Well, sure, after the wedding.\"",
      "\"'Deathly' allergic, Gail. As in, if he walks into a house where a cat has left a smidgen of dander behind, even if the cat is long gone he'll need a respirator.\"",
      "\"A respirator!\"",
      "\"Or whatever you call those things that asthmatics have to carry around with them.\"",
      "\"You mean an atomizer,\" I said.",
      "\"No, not an atomizer; a what's- it. A vaporizer, maybe?\"",
      "I thought it over.",
      "\"At any rate, that's what Debbie claimed. She claimed that even if he's just standing next to her and she has cat dander on her sweater, he will start choking up and he'll need a ...\"",
      "We both stood there, considering.",
      "The cat said, \"Hmm?\"",
      "We looked over at the carrier.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Max said, and he unfastened the two latches and lifted the lid. Instead of stepping out, the cat hunched lower and stared up at me. A gray-and-black tabby with a chunky face. \"So I couldn't think where to go except here,\" Max said. \"I knew where you hide your key. It didn't occur to me that you would be home on a weekday.\"",
      "\"Yes, well ...,\" I said. And then I told the cat, \"Hey there.\" She squared her eyes at me.",
      "\"What's her name?\" I asked Max.",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "\"What? How could you not know?\"",
      "\"I'm just the fosterer,\" he told me. \"I volunteer at this shelter where they need people to foster animals until they can be adopted. Ordinarily it's kittens, batches of feral kittens that need domesticating first, but this one's a senior citizen. I'm thinking of naming her 'Pearl,' at least for as long as I have her around.\"",
      "\"Pearl!\"",
      "\"On account of her color.\"",
      "\"You can't name a cat 'Pearl.'\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"Cats are so bad at language,\" I told him. \"They're not the least bit like dogs. Cats just get your general tone, and 'Pearl' has a tone like a growl.\"",
      "\"It does?\"",
      "\"So does 'Ruby.' So does 'Rhinestone.'\"",
      "\"Aha!\" Max said. \"See there? Everything turns out for the best.\"",
      "\"It does?\" I said. \"What are you talking about?\"",
      "\"You can advise me on cat lore,\" he said. \"Plus you might even decide to adopt her; who knows?\"",
      "\"Max,\" I said, \"sometimes I wonder if you understand the least little thing about me.\"",
      "\"But you love cats! You used to have that homely little calico cat. And this one's accustomed to older women.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" I said.",
      "\"'Older,' I said. Not 'old.'\"",
      "\"I do not want a cat in any way, shape, or form,\" I told him. \"What do you think of 'Mary?'\" he asked. \"Or 'Carol.' How about that?\"",
      "\"Forget it, Max,\" I said. Then I added, \"And you want to steer away from the r sound. An r is a growl, straight out.\"",
      "\"Oh, right. Yes. Thank you.\" He paused. \"How about 'Lucy'?\" he said.",
      "\"Forget it, I told you.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Maybe you could drop her off at a shelter here in Baltimore,\" I said. \"I mean, surely they wouldn't refuse her.\"",
      "\"We're not allowed to just dump our charges any-old-where,\" he told me. \"No, I'd better keep her here at your house, and then take her back to Cornboro if you really don't want her.\"",
      "\"I most emphatically do not want her,\" I said. Then, \"Nor do I want a houseguest.\"",
      "\"Yes, but, see, there's dander all over my clothes now. I can't possibly go back to Debbie's, even without the cat.\"",
      "\"In fact, I wonder if you should come to the wedding, even,\" I said. \"Just think if Kenneth starts choking during the vows.\"",
      "This was pure mischief, on my part. I seriously doubted that Kenneth would choke; he'd always struck me as a sturdy type of guy.",
      "But Max looked stricken. He said, \"Not attend my own daughter's wedding?\"",
      "\"Well, you could maybe wear a raincoat,\" I said. \"Or one of those hazmat suits.\"",
      "The kitchen phone rang. We both glanced over at it. It rang again, and then a third time. \"Aren't you going to get that?\" Max asked me.",
      "But I was thinking it might be Marilee, and sure enough, after my outgoing message Marilee came on and asked, \"Gail? Are you there?\"",
      "This was why I still had an actual, physical answering machine: there were too many people I might not feel like talking to.",
      "\"Because we really need to discuss this,\" Marilee said. \"Could you pick up, please?\"",
      "Max wrinkled his forehead at me.",
      "\"Ignore that,\" I told him.",
      "\"What's going on?\"",
      "\"Nothing's going on.\"",
      "\"Okay ...\"",
      "The answering machine clicked off, and I turned back to the cat. I briefly closed my eyes at her. Cats take that as reassurance; to them it's like a smile. Then I looked off in another direction. I heard a rustle, and when I slid a glance sideways I saw her unfolding herself from the carrier by degrees and stepping gingerly onto the counter. \"A little weight problem,\" I murmured.",
      "As if to demonstrate, she landed on the floor with a noticeable thud.",
      "\"I think it's from stress,\" Max said. \"Apparently she'd been alone for some time before anyone realized her owner had died.\"",
      "I made a sympathetic tsking sound.",
      "\"What's up with Marilee?\" Max asked. He'd never been very good at minding his own business. I said, \"Nothing's up with Marilee.\"",
      "The cat was heading into the living room now, so I made a big show of following her. She paused to sniff at the fringe on the rug and then padded over to an armchair and sprang into it, more nimbly than you might expect.",
      "\"What does she want to discuss?\" Max asked, trailing after me.",
      "I gave up. I said, \"She's retiring in the fall and she wants the board to hire this other person in her place, this Nashville person. And the Nashville person is asking to bring in her own assistant. So I'm thinking I should just quit before they fire me.\"",
      "\"Excellent,\" Max said.",
      "I turned to look at him.",
      "\"Your great talent is for teaching; you know that,\" Max said. \"Dealing with all the kids who are scared to death of math.\"",
      "\"You're forgetting that teachers make no money, though,\" I told him. \"Why else did I put in all that hell time getting my master's degree?\"",
      "\"So? Now that Debbie's finished law school, you can go back to doing what you're good at.\"",
      "\"It's not that simple,\" I told him.",
      "Still, it was nice of him to say that I was good at something. But then he changed the subject. \"Guess I might as well bring in the cat supplies,\" he said. And he went on outside, leaving the front door open behind him even though the air conditioning was on.",
      "I turned back to the cat. She was a bread-loaf shape in the armchair now with her front paws folded beneath her, and when she saw me looking at her she shut her eyes lazily and then opened them again.",

      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "summary": "FDA advisers are set to meet Thursday to decide on updates for this fall's COVID shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",

      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",

      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 16:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",

      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",

      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",

      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",

      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 16:50:51 -0400",
    "summary": "House Republican's budget bill would create $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born between January 2025 and January 2029.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants to kickstart wealth creation for American children by creating $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",
      "Originally called \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or \"MAGA\" savings accounts, the renamed accounts would be managed by banks or investment firms, and operate like traditional investment accounts.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed \"Trump accounts\" for newborns.",
      "What are they called?",
      "House Republicans on Wednesday submitted an amendment to Mr. Trump's domestic policy bill to ditch the original \"Maga\" acronym and rename the accounts \"Trump accounts,\" after the president himself.",
      "Who would get one?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",

    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

      "Stocks are slumping amid signs of slowing consumer spending and investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
      "Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, on Wednesday reported weaker sales for the first quarter and warned of a potential downdraft over the rest of the year as Americans react to U.S. tariffs by pulling back on consumption.",
      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 96 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,845. The Dow Jones Industrial Complex dropped 817 points, or 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4%.",
      "Target shares fell $5.11 on the day, or 5.2% to $93.01.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",
      "Shrinking corporate sales and profits could eventually shackle job growth, which has remained resilient in recent months, experts note.",
      "\"Businesses expect growth in consumer demand to slow and view the outlook as unusually uncertain, so they are pausing hiring,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Some retailers are benefiting from the current environment as some consumers tighten their belts. Discount giant TJX Companies, whose brands include HomeGoods, Marshall's and TJ Maxx, on Wednesday reported a 5% rise in net sales for its fiscal 2026 first quarter from a year ago.",
      "Tax bill overhang",
      "Investors are also assessing how a Republican-backed tax and spending bill\u00a0now being negotiated in the House could impact the nation's finances. Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform.

    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",
      "You can also avoid entering default and having wages garnished through loan consolidation. Essentially, this process replaces your old debt with a new loan that's in good standing and on which you can start making payments. If you're able to repay your loans in full, that's another way to exit default.",

    "story": [
      "Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed to CBS News Friday.",
      "An Army official confirmed that on May 1, the Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land.",
      "FAA air traffic controllers at the airport aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 during the Black Hawk's initial flight toward the Pentagon because they realized both aircraft would be nearing the Pentagon around the same time, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview.",
      "Because of the 20-second loss of contact, the Pentagon's tower did not clear the Black Hawk to land, so the helicopter circled the Pentagon a second time. That's when air traffic controllers at the airport decided to abort the landing of a second jet, a Republic Airways Embraer E170, because they did not have a confident fix on the Black Hawk's location, Braman said.",
      "The Army said in a news release Friday evening that the cause of the lost contact with the Black Hawk is thought to be that a temporary antenna was in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review \"found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic.\"",
      "Braman told the AP that the antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon.",
      "The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.",
      "In initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Army helicopter was on a \"scenic route.\" But the ADSB-Out data, which the Army shared with the AP on Friday, shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path \u2014 directly up the I-395 highway corridor, which is called Route 5, then rounding the Pentagon.",
      "Reagan National Airport air traffic controllers had directed \"go-arounds\" for the two commercial aircraft \"out of an apparent abundance of caution,\" the Army said in its statement. The first go-around occurred before the Black Hawk arrived at the Pentagon helipad and resulted from \"an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,\" according to the Army, and the second occurred during the Black Hawk's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on \"conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.\"",
      "Braman said federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn't have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given controllers its precise location, but Braman said FAA officials told him in meetings last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive, with some of it deviating by as much as three-quarters of a mile.",
      "\"It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,\" Braman said.",

    "story": [
      "Four partners at Paul Weiss \u2014 including the high-profile Democratic attorney Karen Dunn \u2014 are departing the law firm, a spokesperson told CBS News, after Paul Weiss drew attention for striking a deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government.",
      "In addition to Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips and Jeannie Rhee are leaving the 150-year-old firm.",
      "\"On behalf of the firm, Paul Weiss is grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions. We wish them well in all their future endeavors,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It's not clear if the four attorneys' departures from Paul Weiss are related to the firm's agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "Dunn co-chaired Paul Weiss's litigation department, where she is known for representing high-profile clients like Apple and Google. She's also known for her longstanding role in Democratic politics, and has helped lead debate preparations for Democratic candidates for over a decade \u2014 including for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year, The New York Times reported.",
      "Rhee \u2014 who served as managing partner of Paul Weiss's office in Washington, D.C. \u2014 previously worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Isaacson and Phillips served as litigators at the firm, according to their bios on Paul Weiss's website.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the four departing attorneys for comment.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts. The move was part of a wider gambit to punish the president's foes in the legal community, which he claims have \"played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"",
      "The president's executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked on the team of Manhattan prosecutors that investigated Mr. Trump. It also took aim at the firm \u2014 and Rhee \u2014 for\u00a0taking on a pro bono case\u00a0involving the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and criticized Paul Weiss' diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "But that order was later rescinded by Mr. Trump, who said Paul Weiss had agreed to a litany of compromises, like auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes that both the firm and the Trump administration agree upon.",
      "The apparent deal between the president and Paul Weiss \u2014 along with similar deals struck by other law firms threatened by Mr. Trump \u2014 proved controversial in the legal community.",
      "Some other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional.

    "summary": "Some meteorologists say they were unable to accurately forecast an ice storm that hit Northern Michigan in March because National Weather Service balloon sites were cut or reduced.",
    "story": [
      "Detroit \u2014 When the National Guard has to be called out for an ice storm, as was the case in Northern Michigan at the end of March, the situation is dire.",
      "At the time, meteorologists couldn't forecast just how much of the region would be encased in ice.",
      "\"While it [the forecast] showed devastating ice, it ended up still being worse than expected,\" said Ahmad Bajjey, CBS News Detroit's chief meteorologist.",
      "Up to 1.5 inches of ice accumulated across large portions of Northern Michigan, knocking down power lines, blocking roads, and damaging homes and businesses. Last month, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested federal disaster aid.",
      "Bajjey said he was working without National Weather Service data he usually counts on.",
      "\"We couldn't get true real-world data as often as needed,\" Bajjey said.",

      "Those gaps could have helped during the March ice storm, as well as last week, when dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes hit Wisconsin, meteorologists say.",
      "There have also been cuts in places like the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. and \"Tornado Alley\" in the central U.S., where storms get started and move east. One balloon site was also eliminated in the Florida Panhandle\u00a0just days before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "For the past 100 years of U.S. weather forecasting, there's no better substitute to weather balloons, meteorologists say. \u00a0 Associate professor of meteorology Dr. John Allen teaches future meteorologists at Central Michigan University. He also studies how artificial intelligence can improve forecasts.  \u00a0 But he says the data received from weather balloons is irreplaceable. He showed CBS News a device used to communicate with a weather balloon.",
      "\"So what this device is doing is reporting back every couple of seconds as we look through the whole column of the atmosphere,\" Allen said.",
      "His research in AI cannot make up for a lack of air pressure and moisture data collected by balloons.",
      "\"If we have clouds, satellites really don't tell us much about what's actually happening,\" he said, explaining why weather balloons are essential and their data cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar.",
      "In a statement to CBS on News Friday, a NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting.",
      "\"The National Weather Service is committed to delivering accurate, timely, and life-saving forecasts despite speculation,\" the spokesperson said. \"Through strategic transformation, staff reallocation, and updated service standards, NWS is ensuring resilience and continuity of mission-critical functions. Reports suggesting otherwise are false and disrespectful to the many weather scientists who work tirelessly to produce the best weather data in the world.\"",
      "In the meantime, some meteorologists like Bajjey say they have no choice but to make do with new limitations.   \"This is about public safety,\" Bajjey said. \"It's every single forecast, every warning, every alert, and every update. And this is where it comes from.\"",
      "In an open letter published earlier this month, five living former NWS leaders issued a warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the NOAA.",

      "Some NSC staff are moving elsewhere inside the administration, but not all, the sources said. Aides were informed of some of the changes in a meeting at the White House on Friday afternoon.",
      "Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser, as is White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel. Both will be deputies at NSC, three sources said. Baker will continue serving as a Vance aide, according to a White House official.",
      "About 20 people have been informed so far that they are on administrative leave, sources said. Some of the reassignments don't take place until next week, one source said.",
      "Among those leaving the NSC: Eric Trager, who had been handling the Middle East; Alex Wong, principal deputy national security adviser, who is shifting elsewhere in the administration; and Andrew Peek, who handled European matters.",
      "The NSC's communications team is also dissolving as part of the restructuring. Requests for comment were referred to the White House press team.",
      "Axios reported on some of the changes earlier Friday.",
      "\"It's terrible. Less people means less control of the bureaucracy. The key is getting people who are loyal not less people,\" one former member of the National Security Council said.",
      "Another former member of the NSC \u2014 which advises the president on foreign policy and national security matters \u2014 said the institution is strained, pointing to deep suspicions of the NSC within both Trump administrations as well as the Biden administration.",
      "\"Arguably what the NSC has done best in the last 40 years is build the post-9/11 security state and carry out the Iraq and Afghanistan wars \u2014 all of which is deeply unpopular on a bipartisan basis now,\" the former member said. \"Couple that with a Clinton-era failure to effectively manage the end of the Cold War and recognize the rise of stateless terrorism, the track record really doesn't look good.\"",
      "The sudden changes came three weeks after Rubio took over the national security adviser role, replacing Mike Waltz, who was pushed out of the post and nominated as ambassador to the United Nations. That move was driven by a perception that Waltz didn't vet staff enough, a lack of fit between Waltz and the rest of the team, and Waltz's involvement in setting up a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "It's the latest upheaval at Mr. Trump's NSC. Last month, at least a half dozen staffers were fired shortly after right-wing media personality Laura Loomer accused them of being insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump, CBS News previously reported.",
      "There is no date set for Rubio to depart the dual-hatted national security position. He told CBS News on Sunday that he has no departure date or time frame for a departure.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to dispatch hundreds of border agents to different parts of the country so they can help Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest unauthorized immigrants in the U.S interior, three sources familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The plan would be the latest escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to muster the vast resources and personnel of agencies across the federal government to support ICE in its bid to carry out what the president has vowed will be the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "The effort is expected to involve around 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in charge of interdicting the illicit entry of migrants and drugs, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal governments plans that have not been announced.",
      "The sources said the CBP teams would also include members of the agency's Office of Field Operations, which oversees legal entry points into the U.S., and Air and Marine Operations, a specialized law enforcement unit with maritime and aerial assets.",
      "CBP agents and officers assigned to the effort are expected to assist their counterparts in ICE's 25 field offices by supporting immigration enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally, the sources added.",
      "The effort could start as early as next week, two of the sources said.",
      "As immigration officers, CBP personnel have the legal authority to arrest and process immigrants who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Historically, however, CBP's work has been mainly limited to the Mexican and Canadian borders, maritime sectors and international airports.",

The Department of Defense has already deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border to help CBP deter illegal crossings.",
      "The effort also suggests interior enforcement operations are taking precedence over efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border amid a historic drop in illegal crossings there.",
      "In President Trump's first three full months in office, illegal crossings at the southern border have reached the lowest monthly tallies ever publicly reported by CBP. They are also likely the lowest levels since the late 1960s, according to historical government data.",
      "Officials have attributed the dramatic plunge in illegal border crossings to measures put in place by Mr. Trump immediately after he started his second term, including an unprecedented policy that has effectively closed the American asylum system on the premise the country is facing an \"invasion.\"",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on \"its core, legally-protected principles\" over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The threat to Harvard's international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.",
      "Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.",
      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Garber said in a statement Friday to members of the Harvard community.",
      "\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he said.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said.",
      "An earlier suit from the university challenged more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration. That suit came after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "The lawsuit, which Burroughs is also overseeing, alleged the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claimed that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "China's government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students from Harvard would harm the United States' international standing. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard's international student population, with 1,203 coming from China in 2024.",
      "Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration's decision. Large portions of the men's rowing and squash and women's soccer and golf rosters list international hometowns on the school's website. Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on Harvard athletic rosters for the 2024-25 season had international hometowns.",

    "summary": "A district court judge had ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group about its operations and personnel.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted Friday lower court orders that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group as part of a lawsuit that tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force has to comply with federal public records law.",
      "Roberts issued a temporary administrative stay of two orders entered by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which directed DOGE to turn over records related to it operations and personnel and required its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, to sit for a deposition.",
      "The chief justice's order allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, which was filed with the high court earlier this week. Deadlines set by the district judge required DOGE to turn over documents by June 3 and for Gleason's deposition to be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute before the court stems from a Freedom of Information Act request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The watchdog group has argued that DOGE wields \"substantial independent authority,\" which makes it a de facto agency that is subject to FOIA and the Federal Records Act. But the Justice Department disagrees and asserts that DOGE is a presidential advisory body that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies on matters that are important to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including deposing Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., declined to halt the district court's discovery order, finding that it is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing DOGE when he returned to the White House for a second term. The task force is leading his initiative to shrink the size of the federal government. That plan has included large-scale layoffs at federal departments, and the shuttering of several agencies, though the efforts have been the focus of legal wrangling.",
      "The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk, the billionaire leader of Tesla and SpaceX, is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have\u00a0said in court filings\u00a0that he is not an employee of the task force and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE led the White House to\u00a0declare Gleason\u00a0as its acting administrator. She worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",

      "Security for Trump administration border czar Tom Homan costs more than $500,000 a month, multiple sources within the administration told CBS News, an amount that has drawn attention from allies of President Trump who have been seeking to shrink government spending.",
      "The total cost of Homan's security \u2014 with roughly $500,000 in salaries for agents plus airfare, hotel bills and other travel expenses for his protective bubble \u2014 adds up to around $1 million per month for the Trump appointee, another administration official said.",
      "Homan declined to comment on Friday.",
      "\"DHS ensures our leaders are safe and protected,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News Friday, citing \"dangerous rhetoric\" from politicians and activists surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts that result in an increase in assaults and doxxing, exposing someone's identifying information online.",
      "\"We will continue to take measures to ensure Mr. Homan and his family are safe,\" McLaughlin added. The Department of Homeland Security declined to confirm the cost.",
      "Homan is trailed by a rotating detail of special agents from DHS's investigative arm, known as Homeland Security Investigations or HSI, according to one of the sources, who added that roughly 30 agents trade off to provide round-the-clock protection to Homan. That would add up to about $12 million by year's end.",
      "The protection for Homan \u2014 which includes a security detail at his home, when he drives to his offices in the White House West Wing and at Immigration and Customs Enforcement's D.C. headquarters, or when he is out in public \u2014 is paid for by DHS.",
      "Homan, one of the faces of Mr. Trump's pledge to conduct the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, has drawn threats from those who want to cause him harm, two of the sources familiar with his situation said.",
      "Homeland Security Investigations has performed an intelligence threat assessment to gauge the risk to the border czar.",
      "The question is whether he needs as much security as he has requested, said three of the sources, who requested anonymity in order to speak about sensitive security matters.",
      "One administration official described the personnel and money funneled to Homan's security detail as \"extravagant,\" adding they \"sucked resources away from other senior leadership, including other cabinet members.\"",
      "The border czar at times travels in a four-vehicle motorcade \u2014 more cars than the two-car package cabinet members typically use.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Trump campaign asked for protection for Homan but it was rejected, according to multiple sources.",
      "Not every administration official who deals with public criticism is granted government-paid security.",
      "The expense for officials with protection usually hits the higher range if they're required to travel for their job.",
      "The details for former Trump national security advisers John Bolton and Robert O'Brien, who were guarded by the U.S. Secret Service under the Biden administration, cost about $12 million a year, records show. During Mr. Trump's first term, U.S. Marshals Service protection for Education Secretary Betsy Devos ranged annually from about $5 million to just under $8 million.",
      "Homan frequently appears on television and in other media interviews, increasing his public profile \u2014 and he doesn't mince words when it comes to the administration's views on illegal immigration. He has argued for arresting U.S. citizens who knowingly harbor people who are in the country illegally or impede law enforcement efforts, and has called for drug cartels, which he said have an influence in southern border states, to be \"wiped off the face of the earth.\"",
      "In November, Homan said that he began receiving death threats soon after Mr. Trump announced he'd appoint him to be border czar. He told Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" in February that he requires around-the-clock protection. \"I got state troopers around my house 24-7 right now because of death threats,\" Homan said.",

      "\"It's a hot industry, it's a brilliant industry,\" Mr. Trump said of nuclear power before signing the executive orders.",
      "The White House says the orders the president approved Friday will help ensure American energy dominance and provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to the country. The four\u00a0nuclear energy\u00a0executive actions the president signed Friday will speed up nuclear reactor testing at Department of Energy laboratories and expedite applications, officials said. The orders will also clear a path for the Department of Energy and the Pentagon to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Reactor Commission and encourage uranium mining and enrichment.",
      "\"The first tranche of EOs relates to nuclear energy where President Trump is taking truly historic action to usher in the American nuclear renaissance,\" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a call with reporters Friday morning.",
      "Nuclear energy accounts for roughly one-fifth of the nation's power.",
      "On Friday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the U.S. has \"choked\" the nuclear industry \"through overregulation.\" And nuclear energy is key to winning the AI race with China, Burgum said.",
      "\"Energy security is national security,\" said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, adding that troops need reliable energy.",
      "Kratsios said the U.S. has been the world leader in nuclear innovation in the past, but that in the last three decades, has only started and built two reactors.

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",

      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",

      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

Plans show the ads will target 25 House Democrats and make the argument that by opposing this week's bill, the Democrats voted \"for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.\" Of those 25 districts, 13 are seats where a Democrat won the House contest while Mr. Trump carried the district in the presidential race.",
      "Republicans' best chance at padding their narrow majority next year could come in places that had some of the closest Congressional races in the entire country during the 2024 presidential election, including a California seat where the Democratic candidate ousted a Republican incumbent by less than 200 votes. Other areas closely watched by the GOP that are also the subject of the latest ad campaign include two Democrat-held seats in the red state of Ohio, districts Mr. Trump won in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, as well as seats that could prove to be competitive in New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.",
      "Yet while many House Republicans in Washington are cheering the legislation, Democrats see ample political liabilities for their opponents. Democratic leaders view the House as the party's best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington during Mr. Trump's presidency, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election and the small number of seats it would likely take to flip control of the chamber.",
      "The GOP's targeting of Medicaid in particular has quickly been seized on by the left as a major campaign issue, as Democrats charge the Republican agenda's changes imperil healthcare for millions of people.",
      "\"America cannot afford the Republican tax scam. Now that vulnerable Republicans are on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026,\" Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "It remains to be seen however what kind of bill can eventually make it to Mr. Trump's desk, given the changes the GOP-led Senate may make once it gets its hands on the legislation.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 11:01:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has overseen a wide-ranging effort to restructure the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday continued to block the Trump administration from moving forward with its plans to lay off thousands of government workers at more than 20 federal agencies, providing federal employees a lifeline as a legal challenge to President Trump's bid to restructure the federal government moves forward.",
      "The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston covers 21 federal agencies and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and prevents them from implementing reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The judge, who sits on the federal court in San Francisco, also barred agencies from implementing any orders by the Elon Musk-led DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with an executive order signed by President Trump in February that seeks to transform the executive branch. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as AmeriCorps and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "While Illston also granted retrospective relief by ordering federal agencies to rescind any reductions-in-force, or layoffs, issued under the president's February directive and to reinstate government workers who were put on administrative leave, she paused those components of her decision while the administration pursues an appeal.",
      "The Justice Department informed the court on Friday that it will be asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to review Illston's decision.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "She said that the plaintiffs in the case, which are labor unions, nonprofit organizations and local governments, are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr. Trump's executive order usurps Congress's constitutional powers and exceeds his authority.",
      "\"Put simply, in this case, defendants want the court to either declare that nine presidents and twenty-one Congresses did not properly understand the separation of powers, or ignore how the executive branch is implementing large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations. The court can do neither,\" Illston wrote.",
      "Illston had issued a two-week temporary restraining order on May 9 that directed the Trump administration to pause its plans to lay off vast swaths of the federal workforce. That temporary order was set to expire Friday. Her preliminary injunction now extends the initial block on the administration's restructuring of the federal government as the case proceeds.",
      "The Trump administration already asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to allow it to move forward with its reductions-in-force, seeking emergency relief in a request that arose out of Illston's temporary restraining order. The high court has not yet acted on that bid, though the Justice Department will likely ask the Supreme Court to lift Illston's injunction.",
      "Mr. Trump's February executive order directed agencies to make plans to initiate \"large -scale\" reductions in force as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts, due March 13 and April 14.",
      "The Trump administration has said in filings that 40 reductions-in-force at 17 agencies were in progress but blocked by Illston's May 9 order. The plans target\u00a0thousands of federal workers, including up to 10,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services, 8,500 at the Energy Department and half of the workforce at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs has said it intends to slash 83,000 positions.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "Mr. Trump's government-shrinking efforts began shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force led by Musk, and his administration has taken steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students in its escalating battle with the Ivy League school, saying thousands of students must transfer to other schools or leave the country. Harvard filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration, arguing that its action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "The school said Friday that it would file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the Trump administration's move.",

    "summary": "Mothers and relatives of the Venezuelan detainees in CECOT have been communicating about their loved ones in a WhatsApp group.",
    "story": [
      "On May 18, relatives of the Venezuelan migrant detainees in El Salvador's mega prison CECOT, announced to a WhatsApp group the death of Marlene Ramirez, a grandmother who raised one of the men currently detained there, Jonathan Mendoza Ramirez. Her family said she had died of a heart attack, unable to endure the emotional stress of not being able to communicate with her grandson. She could no longer take it, they said.",
      "Since the Trump administration in March removed a group of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members to El Salvador for indefinite detention, a WhatsApp virtual community has come into being, made up largely of mothers of the detainees. The group grew one by one, as the mothers found out about their sons' whereabouts, largely from videos posted on social media by the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. The videos showed the Venezuelan men arriving from the U.S. in shackles, being frog-marched off the plane and into CECOT. Inside the prison, they were forced to kneel as their heads were shaved by guards.",
      "\"I can't recount these videos or else I fall into a serious depression,\" said Jetzy Arteaga, the creator of the WhatsApp group. Her son, Carlos Ca\u00f1izalez Arteaga, is one of the Venezuelan migrants\u00a0transferred to CECOT in March. \"I try to block them, so that I can go on about my day, but only a mother in this situation can understand why these images hurt so much.\" On days when she can't keep the images out of her thoughts, Arteaga says she can't get out of bed and turns to other mothers in the group chat.",
      "\"When one of us is down, we go to their house, run their errands and pick up their other kids from school,\" says Arteaga. \"They're all over Venezuela, and I understand that today, it might be them needing help, but tomorrow it might be me in the hospital.\"",
      "Arteaga created the group to communicate with other mothers because she says she needed answers. \"I was in a state of disbelief, and I was waiting for the U.S. government to say my son was transferred by mistake,\" said Arteaga. \"The U.S. is a country that follows their laws, and when their investigation concludes my son is not a gang member, they'll release him.\"",
      "Records that prove his lack of criminal gang activity in Venezuela, however, have not led to Carlos' release. The group says it has grown and now includes relatives of 170 of the migrant men detained in El Salvador.",
      "\"The first thing I do every morning is check the group chat, and we ask for updates and prayers,\" said Analia Burbano, whose nephew Victor Andres Ortega Burbano, is being held in CECOT. She says she constantly scrolls through social media to see if there are any updates or photos of her nephew in prison.",
      "Burbano says she is now speaking on behalf of her nephew because his mother is emotionally and physically unable to do so. \"Ever since she saw the video of Victor at CECOT, she fell into a depression, does not get up from bed, does not eat and cries every day,\" said Burbano. \"She is very frail.\"",
      "Burbano says her nephew's arrest and transfer came as a surprise, since Ortega had been granted Temporary Protected Status that allowed him to legally work in the U.S. According to immigration documents reviewed by CBS News, Ortega's TPS was approved for June 2024 through last month, in April.",
      "The group frequently makes trips to Miramar, Venezuela, to pressure officials to demand the release and deportation of the men back to their country. The chat serves as a venue to plan the next protest or opportunity to publicize the men's plight at events like those held by the United Nations.",
      "\"We all have our ups and downs, but through this process, we make sure that none of us let the negative thoughts linger for long,\" said Anyi Yohana Casares Jimenez, mother of Jason Alfredo Silva Casares. On March 13, Jimenez says she received the last call from her son, desperately asking her to send over documents proving he didn't have a criminal record in Venezuela. She never heard from him again.",
      "Jason showed up at the U.S. southern border in August 2024 after receiving an appointment through the CBP One app, but remained in detention because immigration agents were suspicious of his crown tattoo, according to his mother. \"There's not a day that I don't search social media for any new videos of him inside CECOT.\"",
      "The three mothers all claim their sons are not part of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, but they do fault the men's tattoos for causing their imprisonment.",
      "\"It was the argument I always had with my son,\" said Arteaga. \"I always asked what his need for a tattoo was.\" Her son tattooed his mother's name \"Jetzy\" on his wrist, a tattoo that now serves as evidence of gang affiliation, according to court documents.",
      "It's now been more than two months since these men were taken to El Salvador and the U.S. government continues to deport anyone who is in the country illegally after President Trump promised to deport \"the worst of the worst\".",
      "\"All we can do is trust that this nightmare will soon end,\" said Burbano.",

They march past statues of battlefield giants, memorize the lessons of Antietam and Afghanistan and are steeped in stories of courage drawn from the long arc of American military history.",
      "But among the lessons on duty and sacrifice for the class of 2025, there's inspiration among their ranks \u2014 one not found in the footnotes of war colleges or the annals of Medal of Honor citations. It's the story of a teenager who never wore a uniform beyond the one he donned as a Junior ROTC cadet in Florida seven years ago \u2014 a boy who dreamed of being a soldier, but before he could achieve it, he had already sacrificed his life as a hero.",
      "Peter Wang, a member of this year's West Point class, was just 15 years old when he was among the 17 killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",
      "When the sounds of gunfire reverberated through the hallways, Peter was in study hall, passing time over a chessboard. As panic spread through the corridors, he moved toward the exit\u2014not to flee, but to hold the door open, easing the way for his classmates to escape behind him.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator for the state of Florida at the time of the shooting, told CBS News the tributes to Peter were a \"solemn recognition of [his] bravery and heroism on that horrific day. Duty, honor, and country are key pillars of West Point cadets, and it's clear Peter personified these principles.\"",
      "He was shot 13 times, first in the foot, then twice more in the thigh. A round tore through his torso. His arms absorbed five more bullets. The final shots\u2014four in total\u2014were to his head, according to Wendolyn Sneed, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy and testified at the shooter's sentencing hearing.",
      "Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, now a U.S. senator, authorized the Florida National Guard to honor Peter with a military funeral. Hundreds assembled in South Florida to pay their respects, with attendees spanning generations and backgrounds.",
      "Junior ROTC cadets from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and other South Florida schools stood saluting in uniform, joined by military veterans and local residents. The gathering reflected the deep impact Peter had on both his peers and the wider community.",
      "An American flag was draped over Peter's casket as \"Taps\" echoed through the air and salutes rose from all corners of the crowd. Among them were veterans with lined faces, uniformed service members, and first responders in dress attire. But it was the youngest among them\u2014fellow Junior ROTC cadets in crisp uniforms\u2014who stood most still.",
      "For his actions, Peter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",
      "West Point granted Peter honorary admission to the class of 2025, which is now preparing to take their commission as second lieutenants and potentially lead soldiers into battle.",
      "\"Peter demonstrated the characteristics and attributes we seek out of graduates of the Naval Academy or West Point,\" said retired Lt. Gen.

      "The Trump administration has launched an operation to terminate the immigration court cases of certain migrants, in order to arrest them and place them in a fast-tracked deportation process instead, government officials and attorneys told CBS News.",
      "Lawyers and advocates this week reported arrests of migrants outside of immigration courthouses across the U.S., saying teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had detained individuals whose cases in front of immigration judges had just been terminated at the request of the government.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News that ICE is conducting an operation to expedite the deportation of migrants with court hearings scheduled in the near future. It's the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country and fulfill what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "The operation involves ICE prosecutors asking immigration judges to terminate the court cases of certain migrants, so agents at the agency can instead arrest those individuals and place them in a more rapid deportation process known as \"expedited removal,\" the officials said.",
      "Unlike immigration court proceedings, which can take years to complete due to a massive backlog of 4 million pending cases, the expedited removal process allows officials to more quickly deport migrants, if their cases satisfy certain conditions.",
      "Migrants who lack proper documents and can't prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years are eligible to be deported under expedited removal, without a court hearing.",
      "Historically, officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks. But the Trump administration vastly expanded its scope soon after taking office.",
      "Expedited removal can also be applied to unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. with the government's permission at legal entry points, and there's no two-year entry limit for those cases. That would place the nearly 1 million migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration program known as CBP One at risk of being targeted by the new ICE operation.",
      "While those placed in expedited removal can be deported without a hearing in immigration court, they are entitled to an interview with an asylum officer if they say they are afraid of being persecuted in their home country. If they pass those screenings, they get a chance to plead their case in immigration court.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin faulted the Biden administration for releasing many migrants with notices to appear in immigration court, instead of trying to deport them quickly through expedited removal.",
      "\"ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Leandro Ferrer, an immigration lawyer based in Phoenix, Arizona, said his clients, two Cuban migrants, appear to have been swept up in the ICE operation when they showed up to their immigration court hearing on Tuesday.",
      "\"There was a sense of relief when the government prosecutors moved to dismiss the removal proceedings,\" Ferrer recounted. \"This has always been, historically, a result that is highly sought after and either we try to win a case on the merits of an application or we try to dismiss the removal proceedings.\"",
      "But to his shock and dismay, Ferrer said ICE agents arrested his clients immediately after they left the courtroom.",
      "\"They did not provide identification, they did not have an arrest warrant, they did not make any attempt to establish whether or not they had committed a crime,\" Ferrer added. \"They just went in and took them.\"",
      "Ferrer said his Cuban clients entered the U.S. in 2022, after showing up to a legal entry point along the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to request asylum.",
      "Even amid ICE's efforts to arrest some migrants after they show up to court, immigration lawyers said they are still strongly advising their clients against missing their hearings, as failure to do so could be grounds for judges to issue a deportation order.",
      "The ICE arrests at immigration courts were reported across the country in several cities with large immigrant populations, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Miami.",
      "\"I began getting calls from family members of those getting arrested asking for help,\" said Antonio Ramos, a Miami-based immigration lawyer, adding that the phone calls began on Monday.",

While numbers have continued to rise under Mr. Trump, experts say the so-called \"Trump Bump\" \u2014 a term used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 is more likely the result of recruitment reforms introduced during former President Joe Biden's term.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exaggerated the scale of the recovery, claiming enlistments have hit modern highs. But public data shows the military is still attracting fewer recruits than it did earlier this decade.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that military recruitment reached 30-year records",
      "Asked for comment on the source of the defense secretary and president's claims, a White House official and the Defense Department both pointed to a\u00a0statement\u00a0by chief Pentagon spokesperson and senior adviser Sean Parnell. \"Since Nov. 5, 2024, the U.S. military has seen the highest recruiting percentage of mission achieved in 30 years,\" Parnell said in April.",
      "Publicly available reports from the Defense Department confirm recruiters are currently meeting their goals for the year, but its monthly reports \u2014 only published online since 2016 \u2014 also show the services frequently adjust annual targets, making historical comparisons less meaningful.",
      "For example, after falling short of their goals in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 amid a tight job market, the Army cut its goal from 65,000 to 55,000 active-duty soldiers for the fiscal year 2024. After meeting that benchmark, it's aiming for 61,000 recruits this year. These shifting goal posts complicate claims of record performance.",
      "When measured by total recruits \u2014 the metric Mr. Trump appeared to explicitly reference \u2014 active military enlistments have risen year over year but remain below recent peaks.",
      "In March, the most recent month available, around 13,000 new people enlisted, an increase of nearly 50% over the prior year, but below the 15,000 recorded in March 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term. The figure includes all branches of the military except for the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The highest monthly figure under Mr. Trump's second term so far was in January\u00a0\u2014 his inauguration month \u2014 when 15,597 recruits received basic training dates. That still trails the 16,800 recorded in January 2018 and 20,000 in August 2024 under Biden.",
      "Recruitment could surpass pre-pandemic levels by the end of fiscal 2025 in September, but it's too early to tell.",
      "And despite recent gains, enlistments remain well below levels achieved three decades ago. In 1990, over 220,000 enlisted in the active military. Those numbers declined after the end of the Cold War and haven't returned to that level, according to historic Defense Department data.",
      "Trump's false claim that recruitment fell to record lows during President Biden's last year",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed military enlistments fell to record lows during Biden's last year in office.",
      "\"Just about a year ago, it was a big story, front page of every paper all over the world, that nobody wanted to enlist in our military,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "That's false. Defense\u00a0data shows military recruitment began to recover after COVID-era declines in fiscal year 2023 and continued to grow in 2024. That year, 146,473 people signed active-duty contracts \u2014 about 12,000 more than the previous year.",
      "Mr. Trump has further suggested enlistment was at a record low right before news of his election. In fact, 10,993 people enlisted in October 2024, the last full month before Election Day, a 60% increase over the same month in 2023.",
      "Experts say recruitment reforms explain why recruitment has ticked up, despite longterm challenges",
      "Experts who study military enlistment say the continued improvements have more to do with changes in recruitment strategy and compensation than the change in commander-in-chief.",
      "Katherine Kuzminski of the Center for a New American Security credits Biden-era programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course launched in 2022 and the Navy's Future Sailor Prep Course launched in 2023 for helping candidates struggling with enlistment requirements. In 2024, about 25% of the Army's enlistments came through a prep course.",
      "\"It's harder to convince someone to be interested in military service than it is to train them to a standard,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Defense statistics show over 70% of American youths don't meet qualifications for military service because of rising rates of obesity, drug use, mental health issues, and difficulties meeting educational standards.",
      "Polls show interest in service has also declined in the last decade, and defense representatives have cited flagging trust in institutions, a shrinking population of veterans who serve as models of service, and the number of job options in the private sector, depending on the strength of the economy.",
      "To better compete with private sector offers, Congress approved a 14.5% pay increase for junior enlisted troops last December that took effect this year.",
      "\"It would benefit the DoD to publicly also recognize that they've made quite a few adjustments to the recruiting enterprise instead of the perception that's coming out that it's driven solely by partisan politics,\" Kuzminski said, \"Because I don't think that for most American youth that's the driving factor for their joining the military.\"",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

    "story": [
      "A Georgia teenager who was detained by federal deportation officers following local traffic charges that have since been dismissed was released from immigration custody late Thursday, her attorney and mother confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, 19, was released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement one day after an immigration judge granted her bond. She was picked up by family friends at an ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, and will return to Dalton, Georgia \u2014 where she lives with her family \u2014 in the overnight hours, Arias Cristobal's mother said. Her mother said she was able to see Arias Cristobal on FaceTime.",
      "Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 4, had been in ICE custody starting in early May, when she was stopped by local police in Dalton over allegations that she had made an improper turn while driving.",
      "She was charged with driving without a license and making an improper turn and booked into the county jail in Dalton. ICE then took custody of Arias Cristobal, who is in the U.S. illegally, at the county jail, which has an agreement to work with federal immigration authorities.",
      "She had been held at the ICE detention facility in Lumpkin since then. Initially, that facility was also housing her father, who had been taken into ICE custody in April, also after a traffic stop. But he was granted bond last week and released.",
      "Though she was released from detention, Arias Cristobal will continue to face deportation to Mexico, as ICE has started a deportation case against her in immigration court. The Department of Homeland Security has previously said she and her father should face \"consequences\" for being in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Given her time in the U.S. and lack of a criminal record, local community members, including the Republican lawmaker representing Dalton in the Georgia legislature, expressed support for Arias Cristobal and called for her release. Community outrage intensified once Dalton authorities dismissed the traffic charges against Arias Cristobal after revealing she had been mistakenly stopped by the police officer who arrested her.",
      "Dustin Baxter, Arias Cristobal's immigration attorney, said an immigration judge on Wednesday granted his client a $1,500 bond, the lowest amount allowed by law.",
      "\"The judge had reviewed Ximena's case in detail and determined that Ximena is in fact not a flight risk or a danger to the community in the least,\" Baxter said. \"The Department of Homeland Security indicated that it would not appeal the judge's decision.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, it would've been unlikely for someone like Arias Cristobal \u2014 an undocumented immigrant without a criminal history who came to the U.S. as a young child \u2014 to be arrested by ICE.",
      "But as part of its sweeping immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has vastly broadened who ICE officers can target for arrest and deportation, revoking Biden-era policies that generally ensured the agency would only target serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals in the country illegally.",
      "Even though Arias Cristobal is an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child \u2014 a group commonly known as \"Dreamers\" \u2014 she did not qualify for an Obama-era program that protects half a million of those individuals from deportation.",
      "That Obama administration policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, requires beneficiaries to have arrived in the U.S. before June 2007. Arias Cristobal came to the country in 2010. DACA has also been closed to new applicants due to federal litigation.",

    "story": [
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink is considering a run for Congress in her home state of Michigan, CBS News has learned.",
      "Brink, who served for 28 years as a diplomat, is mulling a bid in Michigan's 7th congressional district, which is currently represented by Republican Tom Barrett. The Lansing-area district is rated by the Cook Political Report as a tossup, and was represented by Democrat Elissa Slotkin until earlier this year, when she moved to the Senate.",
      "In a statement first given to the Detroit News, Brink said, \"I've dedicated my life to public service \u2014 working under five Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, and am exploring my options and the best way to continue to serve my country and my great home state of Michigan.\"",
      "Brink resigned her post as envoy to Ukraine in April. In an op-ed last week in the Detroit Free Press, she said policy differences with the Trump administration prompted her to step down. President Trump has pressed Ukraine and Russia to strike a peace deal, sometimes lashing out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the process.",
      "On CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, she told moderator Margaret Brennan, \"I resigned from Ukraine and also from the Foreign Service, because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all. It's appeasement and as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.",
      "A career diplomat, Brink was confirmed by the Senate as ambassador to Kyiv shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and stayed on during the early months of the Trump administration.",
      "In April, CBS reported that Brink intended to resign her post as ambassador due to an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including USAID layoffs.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request to halt lower court rulings voiding removals of members from two labor boards.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Trump to remove two members of federal independent labor boards while legal proceedings over their firings move forward.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration to pause a pair of lower court rulings that voided Mr. Trump's removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "\"Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents,\" the court said. \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power. But we do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision.",
      "Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency\u2014a multi-member, bipartisan commission exercising regulatory power whose governing statute contains a for-cause provision. Yet now the President has discharged, concededly without cause, several such officers, including a member of the NLRB (Gwynne Wilcox) and a member of the MSPB (Cathy Harris). Today, this Court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had already temporarily halted the decisions to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider Mr. Trump's emergency appeal. The order from the full court means Wilcox and Harris will remain out of their jobs while the challenge to their firings continues.",
      "Wilcox and Harris' employment statuses have ping-ponged since they were informed by the Trump administration earlier this year that they were removed from their respective roles. Wilcox had been appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed to a second five-year term in 2023. Harris was tapped by Biden to serve on the MSPB in 2022 for a seven-year term.",
      "Each official sued the Trump administration over their firings, arguing they violated the for-cause removal laws that limited the president's ability to oust them. Two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., agreed and voided the firings. The judges each said Wilcox and Harris could remain in their roles at their respective agencies while their litigation plays out.",
      "But a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit paused those decisions, allowing the president to fire Harris and Wilcox again. The two then asked the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider their cases, and it ruled 7-4 to put the district court decisions back in place, meaning Harris and Wilcox could return to their jobs while their challenges moved forward.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and again allow Mr. Trump to oust Wilcox and Harris. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the request for emergency relief that the Constitution gives the president broad power to remove members of multimember boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" such as the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "He argued that a court violates Article II of the Constitution by ordering an executive officer who was removed by the president to be reinstated to their position.",
      "Sauer also argued that the NLRB and MSPB are not covered by an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "The Trump administration did not ask the Supreme Court to overturn that decision in its emergency request, but did suggest that it could consider whether to invalidate the for-cause removal restrictions governing members of the NLRB and MSPB as a violation of the separation of powers. It has, however, said that it would ask the Supreme Court to overrule the 1935 ruling after it receives full briefing and argument and find that it was wrongly decided.",
      "But lawyers for Harris and Wilcox each warned that the administration is asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the structure of numerous agencies, putting at risk the independence of entities like the Federal Reserve Board, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Trump had indicated that he would like to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who he appointed during his first term, writing on social media in April that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" But the president then walked back the suggestion, saying he has \"no intention\" of getting rid of the Fed chief.",
      "The Supreme Court, however, said the structure of the Federal Reserve Board is not threatened because it is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "But Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration and is representing Harris, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president is simply being asked to follow binding precedent, just as his predecessors have done for 90 years.",
      "\"History disproves the government's assertion that the president will be irreparably harmed if he cannot remove Harris,\" he wrote. \"No other president in our lifetimes has ever attempted to violate for-cause removal statutes in this manner. The current chief executive is not being held to a different standard.\"",
      "Katyal also said the MPSB is covered by the exception set by the Supreme Court in its 1935 decision.",
      "\"The board is the easy case,\" he said. \"If the board's structure is not constitutional under Humphrey's Executor, nothing is.\"",
      "In a separate filing, a lawyer for Wilcox, Deepak Gupta, said the statute that lays out the parameters for firing NLRB members has been on the books for nearly 100 years, and no presidential administration until now has tried to remove a member of the board.",
      "\"Nevertheless, the government now claims that its need to remove Gwynne Wilcox is urgent \u2014 so urgent that it asks this court to override the en banc D.C. Circuit's denial of a stay, jettison a century of settled interbranch practice, and signal the overruling of bedrock precedents of this court that have engendered strong reliance interests. The better course is restraint,\" he wrote.",
      "Gupta disputed the Trump administration's claim that it needs emergency relief,, which would require the Supreme Court to \"upend decades of tradition to allow the president to remove an NLRB member for the first time now \u2014 before this court has even had the opportunity to reconsider its longstanding precedent.\"",
      "Beyond the seat on the NLRB that had been filled by Wilcox and Harris' position on the MSPB, there are still vacancies at both agencies that Mr. Trump can fill. But lawyers for both have argued the president's firings have hobbled the boards and stymied their ability to adjudicate labor and employment disputes.",
      "\"By depriving the board of the quorum it needs to carry out its appellate decision making, the president's illegal removal causes immediate harm to the workers, employers, and broader public who depend on it,\" Gupta wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping reshaping of the executive branch. He has fired top officials leading a swath of independent agencies and institutions, and gotten rid of independent agency watchdogs. His administration is moving to dismantle other federal entities and programs, sparking legal challenges.",

Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

      "\"Defendants do acknowledge, as they must, that the Department cannot be shut down without Congress's approval, yet they simultaneously claim that their legislative goals (obtaining Congressional approval to shut down the Department) are distinct from their administrative goals (improving efficiency),\" Joun wrote.",
      "\"There is nothing in the record to support these contradictory positions,\" Joun wrote. \"Not only is there no evidence that Defendants are pursuing a 'legislative goal' or otherwise working with Congress to reach a resolution, but there is also no evidence that the RIF has actually made the Department more efficient. Rather, the record is replete with evidence of the opposite.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:12:56 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",
      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",
      "\"Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes,\" Valantinas said.",
      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",

      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",

      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

    "story": [
      "Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed to CBS News Friday.",
      "An Army official confirmed that on May 1, the Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land.",
      "FAA air traffic controllers at the airport aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 during the Black Hawk's initial flight toward the Pentagon because they realized both aircraft would be nearing the Pentagon around the same time, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview.",
      "Because of the 20-second loss of contact, the Pentagon's tower did not clear the Black Hawk to land, so the helicopter circled the Pentagon a second time. That's when air traffic controllers at the airport decided to abort the landing of a second jet, a Republic Airways Embraer E170, because they did not have a confident fix on the Black Hawk's location, Braman said.",
      "The Army said in a news release Friday evening that the cause of the lost contact with the Black Hawk is thought to be that a temporary antenna was in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review \"found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic.\"",
      "Braman told the AP that the antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon.",
      "The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.",
      "In initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Army helicopter was on a \"scenic route.\" But the ADSB-Out data, which the Army shared with the AP on Friday, shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path \u2014 directly up the I-395 highway corridor, which is called Route 5, then rounding the Pentagon.",
      "Reagan National Airport air traffic controllers had directed \"go-arounds\" for the two commercial aircraft \"out of an apparent abundance of caution,\" the Army said in its statement. The first go-around occurred before the Black Hawk arrived at the Pentagon helipad and resulted from \"an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,\" according to the Army, and the second occurred during the Black Hawk's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on \"conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.\"",
      "Braman said federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn't have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given controllers its precise location, but Braman said FAA officials told him in meetings last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive, with some of it deviating by as much as three-quarters of a mile.",
      "\"It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,\" Braman said.",
      "The Black Hawk was not carrying any passengers.",
      "The aborted landings on May 1, first reported by the AP, added to general unease about continued close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "In March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred. After the May 1 incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The FAA declined to comment on whether its controllers were unable to get a good fix on the Black Hawk's location because of their own equipment issues, citing the ongoing crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "An NTSB official told CBS News Friday that the agency was not briefed on the Army's findings and only learned about them after reading the report from the Associated Press.",
      "\"The NTSB is leading this investigation,\" the NTSB official told CBS News. \"That is well known.

Isaacson and Phillips served as litigators at the firm, according to their bios on Paul Weiss's website.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the four departing attorneys for comment.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts. The move was part of a wider gambit to punish the president's foes in the legal community, which he claims have \"played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"",
      "The president's executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked on the team of Manhattan prosecutors that investigated Mr. Trump. It also took aim at the firm \u2014 and Rhee \u2014 for\u00a0taking on a pro bono case\u00a0involving the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and criticized Paul Weiss' diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "But that order was later rescinded by Mr. Trump, who said Paul Weiss had agreed to a litany of compromises, like auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes that both the firm and the Trump administration agree upon.",

      "Authorities said they became suspicious when a member of the public called the sheriff's office shortly before 10 p.m. on Thursday, questioning whether Johnson was still in custody.",
      "There was an incident at a dorm in the jail where inmates flooded a cell, Sheriff Gerald Sticker said during a news briefing Friday. While a crew was cleaning the dorm, Johnson and another inmate, Trevon Wallace, opened the back door to the jail that leads into the yard, Sticker said. Wallace did not escape and was escorted back inside.",
      "\"Following an immediate head count of the jail population and a review of Johnson's movements throughout the day, it was determined Johnson escaped around 4:30 p.m. when another inmate helped lift him over the perimeter fence,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement.",
      "Sticker said at least four individuals were placed on administrative leave pending a full review.",
      "In May 2024, Johnson was among a group of four inmates who escaped from the jail over the Memorial Day weekend by breaking through the jail's perimeter fence during recreation time in the yard. Johnson and another inmate were found hiding in a dumpster behind a Dollar General store.",
      "Manpower shortages, inadequate staff training and experience, a lack of supervision and insufficient head counts contributed to the escape last year, authorities said at the time.",
      "Tangipahoa Parish's jail in Amite is about 75 miles northwest of New Orleans.",
      "Johnson's escape and subsequent capture come as authorities continue to search for five of the 10 inmates who escaped from a jail in New Orleans\u00a0on May 16. The escape from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, part of which was captured on surveillance video, showed the inmates removing a jail cell door off its track and breaching a wall behind the toilet of a cell.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 20:55:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Some meteorologists say they were unable to accurately forecast an ice storm that hit Northern Michigan in March because National Weather Service balloon sites were cut or reduced.",
    "story": [
      "Detroit \u2014 When the National Guard has to be called out for an ice storm, as was the case in Northern Michigan at the end of March, the situation is dire.",
      "At the time, meteorologists couldn't forecast just how much of the region would be encased in ice.",
      "\"While it [the forecast] showed devastating ice, it ended up still being worse than expected,\" said Ahmad Bajjey, CBS News Detroit's chief meteorologist.",
      "Up to 1.5 inches of ice accumulated across large portions of Northern Michigan, knocking down power lines, blocking roads, and damaging homes and businesses. Last month, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested federal disaster aid.",
      "Bajjey said he was working without National Weather Service data he usually counts on.",
      "\"We couldn't get true real-world data as often as needed,\" Bajjey said.",
      "At least 13 of nearly 100 balloon sites were cut or reduced when the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0took aim at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration earlier this year.\u00a0  Two of them, one in Michigan and another in Wisconsin, left gaps in data.",
      "Those gaps could have helped during the March ice storm, as well as last week, when dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes hit Wisconsin, meteorologists say.",
      "There have also been cuts in places like the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. and \"Tornado Alley\" in the central U.S., where storms get started and move east. One balloon site was also eliminated in the Florida Panhandle\u00a0just days before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "For the past 100 years of U.S. weather forecasting, there's no better substitute to weather balloons, meteorologists say. \u00a0 Associate professor of meteorology Dr. John Allen teaches future meteorologists at Central Michigan University. He also studies how artificial intelligence can improve forecasts.  \u00a0 But he says the data received from weather balloons is irreplaceable. He showed CBS News a device used to communicate with a weather balloon.",
      "\"So what this device is doing is reporting back every couple of seconds as we look through the whole column of the atmosphere,\" Allen said.",
      "His research in AI cannot make up for a lack of air pressure and moisture data collected by balloons.",
      "\"If we have clouds, satellites really don't tell us much about what's actually happening,\" he said, explaining why weather balloons are essential and their data cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar.",
      "In a statement to CBS on News Friday, a NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting.",
      "\"The National Weather Service is committed to delivering accurate, timely, and life-saving forecasts despite speculation,\" the spokesperson said. \"Through strategic transformation, staff reallocation, and updated service standards, NWS is ensuring resilience and continuity of mission-critical functions. Reports suggesting otherwise are false and disrespectful to the many weather scientists who work tirelessly to produce the best weather data in the world.\"",
      "In the meantime, some meteorologists like Bajjey say they have no choice but to make do with new limitations.   \"This is about public safety,\" Bajjey said. \"It's every single forecast, every warning, every alert, and every update. And this is where it comes from.\"",
      "In an open letter published earlier this month, five living former NWS leaders issued a warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the NOAA.",
      "\"Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life,\" the letter said. \"We know that's a nightmare shared by those on the forecasting front lines - and by the people who depend on their efforts.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said that he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple if the company did not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S., a \"frustrating situation for investors\" said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst from Wedbush Securities in a Friday research note.

      "Fans who had purchased tickets to an upcoming performance will be automatically refunded, according to the statement.",

      "Legendary musicians Stevie Nicks, Rod Stewart and Sting were expected to join Joel at different points on the tour.",
      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spinal cord, is the type of fluid that builds up. Typically, your body makes just enough of this fluid each day and absorbs that same amount, according to Johns Hopkins, but sometimes too much fluid can build up, leading to NPH.",
      "\"If that increases abnormally, it can build up in these chambers, called ventricles, in the brain,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained. \"And that can cause pressure on normal brain tissue.\"",
      "As a result, he said, people with the condition may experience symptoms including \"trouble thinking, trouble walking and trouble with urinary incontinence,\" though not every patient will have all the same symptoms.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" LaPook said.",
      "An MRI brain scan can detect the issue, and medical experts say it is usually treatable. The treatment typically involves a surgical procedure to implant a shunt in order to drain the fluid. LaPook said he recently had a patient who was treated this way, \"and now he's feeling perfectly fine.\"",
      "The condition is relatively uncommon, but is more likely to occur in older people.",
      "According to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic, NPH affects bout 0.2% of people between the ages 70 and 80, and about 5.9% of those over 80.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 16:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "summary": "It is Harvard's second suit against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, hours after the Ivy League school challenged a decision by administration officials that targeted its enrollment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed to grant Harvard's request for immediate relief and set a hearing for May 29, during which she will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction in the case. Her order blocks the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "Her brief order said the temporary order is \"justified to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\"",
      "The judge's intervention came hours after Harvard filed a federal lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's decision to bar it from enrolling foreign students, calling it unconstitutional retaliation for defying the White House's political demands. It is the school's second suit against the Trump administration.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government's action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit.",
      "Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries.",
      "The school had said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move, which the department announced on Thursday. It accused Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.",
      "The White House lashed out at the judge's ruling Friday.",
      "\"The American people elected President Trump \u2013 not random local judges with their own liberal agenda \u2013 to run the country,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on \"its core, legally-protected principles\" over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The threat to Harvard's international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.",
      "Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.",
      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Garber said in a statement Friday to members of the Harvard community.",
      "\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he said.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said.",
      "An earlier suit from the university challenged more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration. That suit came after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "The lawsuit, which Burroughs is also overseeing, alleged the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claimed that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "China's government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students from Harvard would harm the United States' international standing. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard's international student population, with 1,203 coming from China in 2024.",
      "Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration's decision. Large portions of the men's rowing and squash and women's soccer and golf rosters list international hometowns on the school's website. Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on Harvard athletic rosters for the 2024-25 season had international hometowns.",

    "summary": "Emails and essays obtained by CBS News shed new light on Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Matthew Crooks had a lot on his mind in January 2024.",
      "The 20-year-old who, six months later, would open fire at President Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally \u2014 striking his ear and killing an audience member \u2014 was busy polishing his applications to transfer from community college to a four-year engineering program.",
      "Crooks was gathering transcripts and asking friends to review his personal statement.",
      "He was also designing a bomb.",
      "He ordered more than two gallons of nitromethane from an online speciality fuel retailer using an encrypted email account, documents obtained by CBS News show. Twelve days later Crooks' purchase hadn't shipped and he wanted to know why.",
      "\"Hello, my name is Thomas. I placed an order on your website on January 19. I have not received any updates of the order shipping out yet and I was wondering if you still have it and when I can expect it to come,\" Crooks emailed the retailer, Hyperfuels, at 7:44 a.m. on Jan. 31, 2024.",
      "Crooks used his community college email account to inquire about shipping, one of the few operational missteps that has allowed for a rare look into the dark side of this ambitious young student.",
      "Two weeks after the nitromethane email, on Feb. 13, 2024, Crooks' focus returned to his academic future, planning a video call he labeled, \"Proofread my Pitt personal essay with friends prior to class.\"",
      "A student who went \"above and beyond\"",
      "Very little is known about how or why Thomas Crooks set out to shoot then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Now, emails, essays and other documents reviewed by CBS News are offering a fresh glimpse into the mind of a young man who was simultaneously planning two irreconcilable futures. In one, Crooks continues his engineering studies, for which he was lauded by professors for his work ethic, progress and class contributions. In the other, he hurtles toward an act that he must have known would end in either prison or \u2014 as it did on July 13, 2024 \u2014 his death.",
      "He was a meticulous and motivated student, attending community college after scoring 1530 on the SATs, records show. He told an adviser he was starting at the school to save money before transferring.",
      "In the hundreds of college emails obtained by CBS News, Crooks rarely veers into personal territory, with a few exceptions. When an upcoming assignment required the presence of five adults, he asked the professor if it would be OK if he only brought two or three. Crooks said that other than his sister and parents, he did \"not have access to any other adults.\"",
      "Crooks wrote a passage for school on why his favorite season is fall on Jan. 30, the day before he contacted Hyperfuels. The passage, penned in various colors, mused on his love for football and his two favorite holidays, Halloween and Thanksgiving. He waxed poetic about the fall weather and asked, \"who doesn't love the changing color of the leaves?\"",
      "Crooks took his classwork seriously, routinely contacting professors to protest if he wasn't satisfied with his grades. After taking a math exam in which he errantly mislabeled a variable, Crooks asked if he could get the point back. The teacher agreed to give him 75% credit for the question.",
      "\"Sounds good,\" Crooks replied. \"That should be enough to get me an A.\"",
      "Crooks did A-level work in most of his courses, according to his transcript. Emails show professors were often impressed by his dedication.",
      "\"Thanks again for your contribution to the class this term \u2014 wouldn't've been the same without you!\" wrote an English professor in December 2022.",
      "One project in particular wowed professors in the engineering department. Crooks, whose mother is visually impaired, designed and 3D-printed a unique chessboard. The prototype included Braille labeling along the rows and columns, and alternating \"raised squares with peg-holes to prevent the pieces from being knocked over,\" as Crooks described it.",
      "Former engineering professor Todd Landree recalls the small department's staff marveling at the project.",
      "\"It was above and beyond what anybody expected,\" Landree said.",
      "Patricia Thompson, who taught the class, said she still thinks about Crooks' project. She also described it as \"above and beyond\" expectations.",
      "\"It's sad that he had so much promise and he chose to do this. It's just very difficult to understand where it came from,\" Thompson said.",
      "A skeptic of government's \"lofty promises\"",
      "Crooks was focused on engineering and computing while at the community college, but a handful of written assignments show hints of a deep skepticism of the federal government and corporations.",
      "A prompt asking students to consider whether engineers involved in NASA's 1986 Challenger disaster acted ethically yielded a dubious reply.",
      "Crooks blamed NASA's administrators, who in pushing for the ill-fated launch \"were trying to live up to the lofty promises they made to Congress which they were never going to be able to fulfill,\" he wrote.",
      "For a 2022 English assignment, Crooks wrote about George Orwell's essay, \"Shooting an Elephant.\" Crooks called the essay \"a powerful allegory warning against adopting imperialistic policies.\"",
      "\"The writing maintains its significance as the themes in it apply to every form of tyrannical government many of which still exist today, and continue to send young men, much like Orwell, to carry out the 'dirty work of Empire,'\" Crooks wrote.",
      "Crooks wrote about Mr. Trump at least once.",
      "The essay was called \"Why Nuclear Energy is the Key to a Cleaner Future,\" and Crooks briefly touched on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, criticizing a decision Mr. Trump made during his first term.",
      "\"To prevent hostile nations from acquiring nuclear technology, America and its allies can stop sales of the technology to those nations and can enter into mutually beneficial agreements like the Iran deal, which effectively halted that nations (sic) nuclear program until President Trump withdrew from it,\" Crooks wrote.",
      "His writing also, at least once, focused in part on then-President Biden.",
      "Crooks reviewed a 2021 opinion column that ran in The Washington Post, concluding that it persuasively argued against Mr. Biden's support for tuition-free community college.",
      "\"Liberals also tend to be in favor of free community college and, in fact, free college in general,\" Crooks wrote. \"So it is very interesting to see an author try to convince the other side using their pre-exisiting (sic) political concerns rather than trying to impress their own on to them\"",
      "While Crooks showed an advanced ability to reason and persuade, he often struggled with spelling and grammar errors. Several essays and work assignments were returned to him asking him to make corrections to his work.",
      "A grand jury with a dead suspect",
      "The nitromethane purchase invoice lists a separate email account from a Belgium-based service that offers end-to-end encryption. FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek told reporters in August that Crooks had researched \"nitromethane, and other materials consistent with the manufacturing of explosive devices.\" Rojek indicated agents accessed multiple overseas-based encrypted email accounts used by Crooks, who did not use explosives during his attack.",
      "A Hyperfuels employee, asked about Crooks' purchase last year, said the company was \"aware of the whole situation.\" The company's president did not respond to phone or text messages.",
      "Crooks' transcript and certain other academic records were first made public by America First Legal, a nonprofit founded by Stephen Miller, a longtime aide to Mr. Trump who is now White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Pennsylvania lawyer Wally Zimolong pursued the records on America First Legal's behalf, winning an open records fight that paved the way for their release last year. Among his discoveries was the little-known federal grand jury that subpoenaed the community college and received Crooks' emails and essays. Zimolong provided CBS News with records related to the grand jury's subpoena and Crooks' transcripts.",
      "A letter from a Justice Department official to the college on July 24, 2024, confirmed the subpoena related to \"an active FBI criminal investigation.\"",
      "Federal grand juries are typically empaneled to determine probable cause to indict a person for a crime, but Crooks \u2014 the only known suspect \u2014 had been dead for 11 days at that point.",
      "\"I think it raises a lot of important questions. Were they investigating anyone else? Are they still investigating?\" Zimolong asked. He said it adds to the mystery surrounding the young man who seemed determined to continue with college until the day he climbed onto the roof of a building in Butler, Pennsylvania, and began firing.",
      "\"A year later we still don't know enough,\" Zimolong said.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 15:31:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Authorities in Hong Kong say COVID-19 levels are the worst in at least a year.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",

      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing.

    "summary": "The House GOP campaign arm is targeting Democrats holding politically risky seats for opposing the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\"",
    "story": [
      "The House Republicans' campaign arm is focusing a new advertising campaign on Democrats from politically risky seats who voted against the GOP's sweeping effort to cut taxes and pass Medicaid work requirements, setting the stage for what may prove to be one of the biggest political messaging clashes of next year's midterms.",
      "Republicans in Washington are attempting to use their control of Congress and the White House to put in place major conservative agenda items sought by President Trump and his allies through one massive piece of legislation, titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" The House GOP's narrow passage of Mr. Trump's agenda earlier this week has set off a struggle between Republicans and Democrats to sway voters about the impact of the bill that is widely expected to play a large role in the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the House will be decided.",
      "In a statement about the advertising campaign, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said the campaign arm \"will make sure voters don't forget how [House Democrats] betrayed working families.\"",
      "The round of digital advertisements places a particular emphasis on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill, which continues key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was the centerpiece of his first term in office. Plans show the ads will target 25 House Democrats and make the argument that by opposing this week's bill, the Democrats voted \"for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.\" Of those 25 districts, 13 are seats where a Democrat won the House contest while Mr. Trump carried the district in the presidential race.",
      "Republicans' best chance at padding their narrow majority next year could come in places that had some of the closest Congressional races in the entire country during the 2024 presidential election, including a California seat where the Democratic candidate ousted a Republican incumbent by less than 200 votes. Other areas closely watched by the GOP that are also the subject of the latest ad campaign include two Democrat-held seats in the red state of Ohio, districts Mr. Trump won in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, as well as seats that could prove to be competitive in New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.",
      "Yet while many House Republicans in Washington are cheering the legislation, Democrats see ample political liabilities for their opponents. Democratic leaders view the House as the party's best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington during Mr. Trump's presidency, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election and the small number of seats it would likely take to flip control of the chamber.",
      "The GOP's targeting of Medicaid in particular has quickly been seized on by the left as a major campaign issue, as Democrats charge the Republican agenda's changes imperil healthcare for millions of people.",
      "\"America cannot afford the Republican tax scam. Now that vulnerable Republicans are on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026,\" Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "It remains to be seen however what kind of bill can eventually make it to Mr. Trump's desk, given the changes the GOP-led Senate may make once it gets its hands on the legislation.",

      "The nighttime Russian attack that stretched into early Saturday came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an exchange that was agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday, acting head of Kyiv military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, wrote on Telegram. According to Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "Prior to the attack, city mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned Kyiv residents of more than 20 Russian strike drones heading towards Kyiv. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend that will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia's Defense Ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine.",

      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \"confidence-building measure\" and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks to end the fighting as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday night that Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \"sustainable, long-term, comprehensive\" peace agreement once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army's battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "On Monday, President Trump said he held a two-hour phone call with Putin which he described as \"excellent.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he thinks Putin wants peace, Mr. Trump responded, \"I do,\" and asked if he trusts Putin, Mr. Trump responded, \"I do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that he thinks \"some progress has been made.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",

      "The attacker targeted people on the platform between tracks 13 and 14 in the station at around 6 p.m. local time, according to police. The station in downtown Hamburg, Germany's second-biggest city, is a major hub for local, regional and long-distance trains.",
      "Hamburg's fire service initially said six people sustained life-threatening injuries, while another three were seriously injured and three had slight injuries, German news agency dpa reported.

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 After a monthlong trial, eight of the 10 people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian\u00a0in Paris in 2016 were convicted on Friday.",
      "The ringleader and seven other people involved in the heist were found guilty, but will not return to prison. The court acquitted two defendants who were accused of handing out information about Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, the ringleader, was handed the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment. Five of those years are a suspended sentence. Due to time already served in jail, he will not return to detention.",
      "Three others who were accused of the most serious charges \u2014 Yunis Abbas, Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexandre Boyer \u2014 each got seven years, five of them suspended. Like Khedache, they will not return to detention. Dubreucq, 69, was absent from the sentencing as he is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Prosecutors had called for the four to face 10-year sentences. The chief judge, David De Pas, said the ages of the defendants \u2014 the oldest is 79 and some others are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences that would have sent them to jail. Boyer, 35, is the only young person involved in the crime.",
      "\"It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening,\" De Pas said. He said the nine years between the robbery and the trial were also taken into account in the sentencing.",
      "Still, he said that Kardashian had been traumatized by the robbery in her hotel.",
      "\"You caused harm, even if you didn't strike physically and blood was not spilt,\" De Pas said. \"You caused fear.\"",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who was not present for the sentencing, said in a statement that she was \"deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice\" in the case. In court, lawyers for Kardashian said the reality star was \"satisfied\" with the verdict.",
      "\"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\" she said in her statement. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.\"",
      "The 10 accused have been known in France as les papys braqueurs, or the \"Grandpa robbers,\" because of their ages. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and Khedache, now deaf and largely mute, leaned on a cane. Khedache and Abbas, who previously admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court before their sentencing and conviction.",
      "In a scribbled note to the court, Khedache offered \"a thousand apologies.\" He also apologized to his son, Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, who was a driver for the gang that night. Khedache's DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",
      "Khedache's son Harminy, 38, accused of having been a driver for the gang that night, was given a five-year sentence, with four of those years suspended.",
      "The only woman in the dock, Christiane Glotin, 79, former companion of Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, who was accused of being the gang's \"secretary,\" was given a four-year suspended sentence.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte, charged with being an accomplice, was handed a three-year suspended sentence. Marc Boyer, father of Marc-Alexandre Boyer, was fined $5,700 on weapons charges.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 09:48:24 -0400",
    "summary": "An ongoing prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia was the only result of recent peace talks, but President Trump wonders if it \"could lead to something big???\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine had carried out a large exchange of prisoners from their more than three-year war, while Ukrainian and Russian officials said the swap was ongoing but not yet complete. The details remained unconfirmed, but the swap appeared to be one of the few signs of any progress in international efforts to halt the fighting.",
      "\"A major prisoners swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social platform. He said it would \"go into effect shortly,\" although it was not clear what that meant.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the details of the swap told The Associated Press that the exchange was ongoing Friday morning but had not finished. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense later confirmed that the swap was underway, saying the two countries had exchanged 270 prisoners of war and 120 civilians, and that the process would continue in the coming days, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Both Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported in recent days that a swap had been agreed for about 1,000 prisoners to be handed over by each side, but those overall figures were not confirmed by either government on Friday.",
      "Shamsail Saraliev, a senior Russian lawmaker and representative of the parliamentary coordination group on military operations, told the country's RBC\u00a0news agency on Thursday that it would be difficult to conduct a prisoner exchange with Ukraine involving as many as 2,000 prisoners in total in just a day, saying the process would likely take several days.",
      "\"This could lead to something big???\" Mr. Trump said in his post on Friday, apparently referring to international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. White House and National Security Council officials did not immediately respond to requests for further details.",
      "Speaking Friday at the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been \"no decisions or agreements yet on the next venue for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.\"",
      "The ongoing exchange was agreed last week in the first direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow's 2022 invasion of its neighbor. That meeting in Turkey lasted just two hours and brought no breakthrough in international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting.",
      "Still, the fact that the two sides had even sat down face-to-face on May 15 was a significant development in itself, even though Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to accept his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's, challenge to show up for the negotiations in person.",
      "Several days later, Mr. Trump held a two-hour phone call with Putin, the tone and spirit of which he described as \"excellent.\" He said Russia and Ukraine would \"immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire,\" and he then held a separate call with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly before taking office for his second term that he could bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end within 24 hours.",

    "summary": "As Trump moves to ban foreign students from enrolling at Harvard, at least one university in China says applicants are welcome to come there instead.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban international students from Harvard would harm America's international standing, and one university in Hong Kong looked to capitalize on the uncertainty by promising to take them in. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University's international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school's data, or about a quarter of the overall student body, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting that Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\"But with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\" the CCTV commentary said. It went on to say that it becomes necessary for international students to consider other options \"when policy uncertainty becomes the norm.\"",
      "Educational cooperation with the U.S. is mutually beneficial and China opposes its politicization, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "\"The relevant actions by the U.S. side will only damage its own image and international credibility,\" she said.",
      "She added that China would firmly protect the rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars abroad but she didn't offer any details on how it would do so in this situation.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem accused Harvard this week of \"fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\"",
      "She said the administration's action against the renowned university would \"serve as a warning\" to other colleges.",
      "Last month, CBS Boston reported that Noem had demanded detailed records on the purported \"illegal and violent activities\" of Harvard's foreign student visa holders.",
      "\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,\" Noem said in a statement. \"Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Harvard has become \"a hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\"",
      "\"They have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions,\" Jackson said in the statement.",
      "Harvard has called the administration's move unlawful, and in a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, the university said the government's action violated the First Amendment and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit. The school said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move.",
      "\"We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University \u2014 and this nation \u2014 immeasurably,\" a spokesperson for the university said in a statement released on Thursday. \"We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community.\"",
      "CBS Boston reported that panic was quickly setting in for some of Harvard's incoming foreign students, who have been left scrambling to find other university options and make new plans ahead of the autumn term. Already, at least one Chinese university is publicly looking to help meet their needs.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology extended an open invitation to international students already at Harvard and those who have been admitted. The institution posted a news release saying it would provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition.",
      "Some people in China joked online about having the university open a branch in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, whose name shares the same character as Harvard's name in Chinese.",
      "The issue of Chinese students studying overseas has long been a point of tension in the relationship with the United States. During Mr. Trump's first term, China's Ministry of Education warned students about rising rejections rates and shorter terms for visas in the U.S.",
      "Last year, the Chinese foreign ministry protested that a number of Chinese students had been interrogated and sent home upon arrival at U.S. airports.",
      "China's state media outlets have long played up gun violence in the U.S. and portrayed America as a dangerous place. Some Chinese students are opting to study in the U.K. or other countries rather than the U.S.",

    "summary": "North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un said a new naval destroyer was damaged in a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness.\"",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vented fury at his own military and other officials Wednesday after his country's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch that he was there to witness, state media reported Thursday. Kim wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country, amid a long-simmering standoff over his nuclear weapons.",
      "It is uncommon for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks or accidents, and observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers' Party meeting slated for late June to address their \"irresponsible errors.\"",
      "\"It's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul's Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country's first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military's operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC appeared to show the vessel rolled onto its side, positioned diagonally from the dock, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin's Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. North Korea has provided Russia's Vladimir Putin with equipment and even soldiers to aid in his ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.",
      "While North Korea's naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North's advancing nuclear program. In April, the U.S. military flew long-range B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula in joint exercise with the South, in a show of force against North Korea days after Kim's powerful sister vowed to resist a U.S.-led push to eliminate the Pyongyang's nuclear program",
      "He says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",
      "Hours after releasing the report on the damaged destroyer, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles from an area about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Chongjin, according to South Korea's military. The launches were a continuation of a streak of weapons-testing activities by North Korea in recent years. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afrikaners-react-trump-white-genocide-south-africa/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 21:04:30 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has singled out White Afrikaner farmers for U.S. refugee status, claiming they're persecuted in South Africa. But most people there say it's simply not true.",
    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",
      "They want to farm in a country, Serfontein says, where most people understand that the land must be shared by both Black and White.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 20:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who pushed back on claims about White genocide in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Attorneys General Kris Kobach, of Kansas, Alan Wilson, of South Carolina, and Drew Wrigley, of North Dakota, spoke with Fox News Digital at the U.S.-Mexico border in Yuma, Arizona.",
      "YUMA, ARIZONA \u2013 Republican attorneys general from 11 states visited the U.S.-Mexico border wall in remote Yuma, Arizona, this week touting a more than 90% decrease in illegal crossings since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "Their visit came a day before the House narrowly passed Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which in part allocates $46.5 billion to revive construction of the wall, which at its current stage covers just a fourth of the approximately 1,900-mile-long stretch separating the United States from Mexico. In Yuma, a city of just 110,000 people, local officials briefed the Republican attorneys general of Kansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Alabama, Montana, Iowa and Indiana on how an average of 1,500 people were illegally crossing the border a day during the first six months of the Biden administration. That\u2019s dropped to about four daily illegal crossings since Trump took office.",
      "In addition to the border wall itself, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach -- chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association \u2013 told Fox News Digital the administration needs other \"force multipliers,\" especially with the task of carrying out the \"largest interior removal since the Eisenhower administration.\" He announced an additional three GOP states entered into 287(G) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which means local and state deputies and officers are trained to exercise federal law enforcement powers, including making immigration-related arrests, initiating removal processes, conducting investigations and tapping into ICE databases.",

      "Republican attorneys general from 11 states visited the border wall in Yuma, Arizona, on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. (Danielle Wallace/Fox News Digital)",
      "\"The thing the Trump administration needs the most right now is force multipliers,\" Kobach said. \"Even if we doubled the number of Border Patrol agents at ICE stations, we still wouldn't have enough. This border wall, which I'm looking at, is one force multiplier at the border. The other big force multiplier is state and local law enforcement signing 287(g) agreements and then helping ICE in the interior. And that's where the red states are leading the way.\"",
      "South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 540 kilograms of fentanyl and 850 kilograms of cocaine were trafficked into the Palmetto State originated from Mexican drug cartels. One kilo alone is enough to kill half a million people.",
      "\"This is the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night. I have two teenage kids in high school. When you hear about parents losing a kid in an overdose, it really strikes at your core. And so it's not just about law enforcement, it's about national security,\" Wilson told Fox News Digital. \"As a 29-year veteran of the Army, an Iraq war veteran. I think in terms of national security, as well as law enforcement. This right here, what happens here, President Trump's policies here have empowered local law enforcement and local and state prosecutors like myself to be able to more effectively combat the illicit activity, starting with Mexican drug cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua.\"",
      "Wilson said it\u2019s important to fortify a \"digital border,\" noting how Mexican drug cartels, Chinese nationals and other illicit criminal organizations launder the proceeds of human and drug trafficking and other crimes using platforms such as WeChat. Wilson has partnered with North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and attorneys general from four other states in a bipartisan effort to target the Chinese app allegedly linked to the international fentanyl trade.",
      "The 11 Republican attorneys general in Yuma highlighted the importance of making the trip to the southern border despite their home states not directly bordering Mexico. Under the Biden administration, the Republicans argued that every state became a border state with the trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly drugs, as well as people across the border.",

That\u2019s leadership,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said. \"In Kentucky, we lost 1,400 lives last year to drugs coming over this border. That\u2019s not abstract\u2014it\u2019s empty chairs at kitchen tables. I\u2019m here to thank the men and women who wear the badge, who\u2019ve made this border secure again.\"",
      "Republican attorneys general hold up makeshift fencing used during the Biden administration surge in Yuma, Arizona, on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. (Danielle Wallace/Fox News Digital)",
      "\"Alabama may not be a border state, but we\u2019ve seen the cost of an open border \u2013 fentanyl deaths, rising crime. The difference now? It\u2019s not the law that changed, it\u2019s the leadership,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said. \"Border encounters are down 93%, gotaways down 95%. That\u2019s the result of letting immigration enforcement do their jobs. We\u2019re no longer the last line of defense\u2014we\u2019re partners in restoring the rule of law.\"",
      "\"When federal officials can\u2019t do their jobs, every state becomes a border state\u2014even Indiana,\" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said. \"We were the first non-border state to sue the Biden administration over its lawless immigration policies. Now, under new leadership, morale at the border has skyrocketed. I\u2019m here not just for our law enforcement, but for the teachers overwhelmed by the fallout, for the parents and professionals caught in a broken system. Enough is enough.\"",
      "A stop on the tour included seeing pallets of $2 million worth of border wall supplies paid for under Trump\u2019s first term that the Biden administration prevented federal contractors from erecting \u2013 something Kobach categorized as \"dereliction of duty\" and \"deliberate efforts to keep our border open.\" The Republican attorneys general also heard from the local hospital system, which incurred $26 million in unreimbursed care costs during a six-month period between December 2021 and May 2022 primarily due to treating migrants. At the peak of the crisis, approximately 350,000 illegal aliens crossed the border through the Yuma sector in a single year under the Biden administration.",
      "The surge caused $1.2 million in losses to three family farms in the region, as migrants camped out and defecated around crops. Local officials underscored the national food security risks given Yuma produces 2,500 semi-loads of leafy greens per day during peak season. The Marine Top Gun School brings thousands more U.S. Marines to Yuma every six months, but live-fire drills had to be shut down due to the surge in illegal crossings near ranges, local officials told the attorneys general, highlighting how military readiness was also impacted due to the Biden border crisis.",

      "\"Many of them were rotated down here to put in pretty lengthy shifts. I heard the challenges. They were very, very frustrated, and a lot put in retirements. We had a lot of agents who just flat quit because they were demoralized,\" Knudsen said, noting how Border Patrol agents who briefed the attorneys general in Yuma reported how the \"difference is absolutely night and day\" since Trump has returned to office with the amount of resources and support at their disposal.",
      "\"During the Biden administration, Montana\u2019s fentanyl seizures went up 20,000% \u2013 cartel fentanyl piling into Montana up 20,000%. During those same four years, Montana\u2019s official count of overdose fentanyl deaths went up nearly 2,000%,\" Knudsen said. \"Every state has become a border state.

      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system.

      "Why are scam ads so widespread?",
      "The problem of\u00a0scam ads on Facebook has grown rapidly in recent years. Experts point to the rise of\u00a0cryptocurrency schemes,\u00a0AI-generated content and\u00a0organized criminal groups operating from Southeast Asia.

      "How to protect yourself from scam ads",
      "Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads.",
      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public.

Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed.

      "If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 16:07:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",
      "We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "Ways to protect yourself after the Ascension data breach",
      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

However, the exact price for the latest models, including the Hero PRO, will depend on factors like insurance coverage, customization and specific user requirements.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "A European startup successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.",
      "While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.",
      "This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics.",
      "By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

      "What was learned and tested",
      "The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK.",
      "Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

      "As authorities investigate the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is urging Americans to confront hatred.",
      "ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement that he felt the shooting was \"inevitable\" in a \"climate of relentless antisemitism\" in the U.S. This aligns with the ADL\u2019s findings in its annual audit, which showed that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose for the fourth consecutive year in 2024.",
      "\"I can't help but think this persistent level of demonization and harassment of Israelis and Jews, along with this rhetoric that celebrates terrorism and violence against Israelis and, you know, made for an environment that enabled this to happen,\" ADL Senior Vice President of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence, Oren Segal told Fox News Digital.",
      "A man looks on next to police officers working at the site where, according to the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary, two Israeli embassy staff members were shot dead near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2025.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)",
      "FATAL SHOOTING OF ISRAELI EMBASSY WORKERS IN DC SPARKS OUTRAGE FROM TRUMP, ISRAELI PRESIDENT",
      "The ADL recorded 151 antisemitic incidents in Washington, D.C., in 2024, a drop from the 171 incidents reported in 2023. However, both 2023 and 2024 represent large spikes compared to 2022, when just 37 incidents were recorded.",
      "Segal told Fox News Digital that the ADL has observed anti-Israel language becoming \"more militant\" and moving away from criticisms of the Israeli government and its policies, which he said are not antisemitic. He also added that after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 massacre \"people were more willing to tolerate the types of activities targeting the Jewish community that, you know, would seem anathema to anybody else.\"",
      "ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS BREAK RECORD FOR 4TH STRAIGHT YEAR, ADL FINDS",
      "\"This was not just against the Jewish community of D.C., but an assault on all Jewish Americans and indeed all Americans,\" Greenblatt said in a statement about the shooting. \"We know that words have consequences. When antisemitic rhetoric is normalized, tolerated, or even amplified in our public discourse, it creates an environment where violence against Jews becomes more likely.\"",
      "Elias Rodriguez, 30, who is suspected of fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy workers \u2014 Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim \u2014 reportedly yelled \"Free, Free Palestine\" as he was being taken into custody. Several Jewish commentators online have said that the shooting is emblematic of what \"globalize the intifada\" \u2014 a slogan used in anti-Israel protests \u2014 means.",
      "\"The concern that many in the Jewish community have when they hear phrases like \u2018globalize the intifada\u2019 is that it reminds them of the intifadas that occurred, right, which were violent,\" Segal told Fox News Digital. \u00a0\"They featured suicide bombings, a lot of death and destruction. So, when you call for the globalization of an intifada, many people hear that as calling for the globalization for violence against Jews.\"",
      "He added that the fatal shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in D.C., was a \"pretty clear\" case of antisemitism.",
      "WITNESS RECOUNTS CHILLING MOMENT DC JEWISH MUSEUM SHOOTER CONFESSED 'I DID THIS FOR GAZA'",
      "Segal also said that since Oct. 7, the ADL has seen an increase in the marginalization of the Jewish community, including \"these efforts to normalize that any Jewish person or anybody who supports Israel is a legitimate target.\" He recalled that just as after Oct. 7, there were those who justified the massacre, there are those who are trying to excuse the murders of Lischinsky and Milgrim.",

      "\"I think what we need to remember is that when we have been calling out the most extreme rhetoric at protests and events around the country, we haven't focused on criticism of Israel. We have focused on the type of language and activity that we believe, that we have seen leads to violence,\" Segal told Fox News Digital. \"And so, I hope that when people try to contextualize what happened in D.C., they look back at what we have been trying to say, what we have been warning about because I think if you understand how words lead to action, more people hopefully will be part of that solution in pushing back against these narratives.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital at the annual Jerusalem Post Conference in New York, Special Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler responded to a Washington Post report that claimed President Donald Trump threatened to abandon Israel unless the war ended as \"fake news.\"",
      "\"That sounds like fake news to me,\" he said. \"I think the president has maintained a very high degree of support for Israel.\" He added, \"He may be saying, 'Hey, listen, let\u2019s try to end the war,' he might speak strongly, but I think American president, in particular, this president's support, President Trump\u2019s support for Israel is ironclad.\"",
      "Separately, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee also rejected the claim. In an interview with Israel's Ynet, he said, \"Their reporting is nonsense. They need to listen to what the President says - not what some uninformed 'source' pretends to know.'\"",

      "Boehler emphasized that the U.S. government's primary focus remains on securing the release of the 58 hostages still held by Hamas. \"I think there's obviously continued back and forth. The President made it very clear that he wants something to come to conclusion.\"",
      "\"I know that he and Steve [Witkoff] are working very hard right now to try to bring that home. So, a very fluid situation, but our primary focus is number one, the hostages, and number two, Israel\u2019s security,\" he said.",
      "On the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Boehler addressed the recent development of opening borders to allow aid trucks into Gaza after two months of a blockade. He also discussed the new U.S.-backed mechanism that could potentially replace the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).",
      "\"Perhaps there needs to be a replacement for UNRWA. We\u2019ve had a lot of issues with the U.N. And if this works, if it gets food to the Palestinian people who need it, then I greatly favor it,\" Boehler said.",
      "Later, in an interview on stage at the Jerusalem Post conference, Boehler recalled the tense moments surrounding the release of American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander. \"It\u2019s an unbelievable moment. It was an unbelievable moment on Sunday. The whole time, we couldn\u2019t sleep. It was exciting, nerve-wracking. We watched pretty much real-time. We were waiting for Steve Witkoff to come. We were waiting the whole time for the Red Cross. When the helicopter landed, we saw it on TV. That first phone call was unbelievable. It was right on Mother\u2019s Day when we went over. It had a lot of meaning \u2014 for me, Steve, and everybody.\"",

If Hamas wants to come forward and make a legitimate offer, they\u2019re willing to stand by and release hostages, we\u2019re always open to that.\"",
      "He also credited the recent Israeli ground operations for increasing pressure on Hamas, saying, \"I do think we\u2019re closer than we ever were. Part of that is because of the movement of Israel and the IDF on the ground.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 17:25:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The FDA picked the LP.8.1 Covid strain for the fall vaccines, fueling concerns that the shots may be limited to only the most at-risk Americans this fall.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it would like drugmakers to update the Covid vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain, fueling concerns that the shots may be limited to only the most at-risk Americans this fall.",
      "The FDA\u2019s decision differs slightly from the recommendation made by its vaccine advisory committee earlier that day, which was to stick to the strains used in the current Covid shots, although panel members said LP.8.1 was a suitable alternative.",
      "Studies by Moderna and Pfizer showed that an LP.8.1-targeted vaccine in fact induced a modestly stronger immune response to the circulating strains than the current Covid shots, which target a variant called JN.1 or one of its descendants, KP.2.",
      "LP.8.1 is also a descendent of JN.1, and it is the dominant strain circulating in the U.S., accounting for roughly 3 in 4 new Covid cases, according to FDA briefing documents released earlier this week. It\u2019s different from a strain dubbed NB.1.8.1 that was recently detected in the U.S. and caused a surge in hospitalizations in China.",
      "Normally, changing the strain for the vaccine wouldn\u2019t raise questions \u2014 it's been the practice of the U.S. in recent years, following a similar model to how the flu shot is updated each year. For Pfizer and Moderna, their mRNA technology makes it particularly easy to update their vaccines.",
      "But this year, the change is expected to trigger new rules by the FDA that new Covid vaccines for healthy kids and adults must undergo placebo-controlled clinical trials \u2014 a process Dr. Marty Makary, the agency\u2019s commissioner, told a Senate committee on Thursday could take roughly a year.",
      "The updated Covid shots are still expected to be available in the fall to adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk for severe illness \u2014 two groups that are exempt from the clinical trial requirement.",
      "The list of underlying conditions that raises a person's risk is extensive \u2014 \u201cphysical inactivity\u201d is even included. Officials estimated that more than 100 million people in the U.S. would still qualify for a shot.",
      "But the clinical trial requirement \u201cwould clearly delay and impede access to vaccines for those people who want it,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at Georgetown University and a former chief scientist at the FDA.",
      "However, Goodman added, a number of questions remain about the FDA\u2019s policy, including how many people would be needed for the trials and whether a new strain selection would indeed trigger the new trial requirement.",
      "When asked by committee members about the new policy on Thursday, FDA officials either said that the questions were off-topic or that the agency was still finalizing the details with drugmakers.",
      "The FDA\u2019s notice also states it would \u201cpreferentially\u201d like drugmakers to update their shots to the LP.8.1 strain \u2014 potentially leaving room for drugmakers to stick to their existing formulations.",
      "\u201cI suspect we will learn more and their approach may become clearer and/or evolve in coming days,\u201d Goodman said. He added it makes sense to leave room for drugmakers to update to either strain, noting it\u2019s often difficult to predict how Covid will evolve.",
      "The FDA directed all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cThe COVID-19 public health emergency has officially ended, and we are entering a new phase in our response to the virus,\u201d Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cA rubber-stamping approach to approving COVID boosters in perpetuity without updated clinical trial data under the Biden Administration is now over.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a Pfizer spokesperson directed NBC News to comments by the company Thursday, which stated it was prepared to \u201cinitiate supply of a 2025/2026 vaccine formula per FDA guidance, immediately upon approval.\u201d",
      "Moderna and Novavax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "There are also questions about insurance coverage and whether patients who are ineligible for the shots would have to pay out of pocket if they wanted one.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna are charging up to $150 per dose for a Covid vaccine, according to the CDC\u2019s vaccine price list. The agency doesn\u2019t list the cost of the Novavax vaccine, which was fully  approved earlier this month.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, said, \u201cHealth plans have prioritized providing affordable access to preventive services, including vaccines.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will continue to monitor the forthcoming recommendations and guidance from ACIP and CDC,\u201d the spokesperson said, referring to the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cAs of today, there is no change in how plans cover the existing vaccines for the previously recommended populations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A U.S.-born citizen who was wrestled into the dirt, handcuffed and detained in a vehicle as part of an immigration raid had a REAL ID on him that was dismissed as fake, the man's cousin said Friday.",
      "Video of the arrest, aired by Noticias Telemundo, showed authorities grabbing Leonardo Garcia Venegas, 25, while at a job site in Foley, Alabama, on Wednesday and bending his arms behind him. Someone off-camera can be heard yelling, \"He's a citizen.\"",
      "Garcia told Noticias Telemundo that authorities took his ID from his wallet and told him it was fake before handcuffing him. REAL ID is the identification U.S. citizens are required by law to have in order to travel through airports and enter federal buildings. It is considered a higher security form of identification.",
      "\"Apparently a REAL ID is not valid anymore. He has a REAL ID,\" his cousin Shelah Venegas said. \"We all made sure we have the REAL ID and went through the protocols the administration is asking for. ... He has his REAL ID and then they see him and I guess because his English isn't fluent and/or because he's brown it's fake, it's not real.\"",
      "Garcia had told Noticias Telemundo that \"they grabbed me real bad\" and the handcuffs were placed \"very hard\" on him.",
      "Garcia said he was released from the vehicle where he was held after he gave the arresting officials his Social Security number, which showed he is a U.S. citizen.",
      "The arrest has left Garcia, who was born in Florida, shaken, particularly because the officers also arrested and detained his brother, who is not in the country legally, Venegas said. She added that Garcia lived with his brother. Their parents are from Mexico.",
      "\"He was actually pretty sore when he got back,\" Venegas said of Garcia. \"He said his arms were hurting and his hands. His wrists, you could see where he had all the marks from the handcuffs. ... The way they put him on the ground, his knees also were hurting.\"",
      "She said they have been trying to find a lawyer but local ones have told them that it is nearly impossible to sue a federal agent. It is not clear from the video whether the authorities were federal immigration agents or local law enforcement carrying out enforcement duties.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to NBC News that Garcia interfered with an arrest during a targeted worksite operation.",
      "\u201cHe physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands,\u201d said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary. \u201cAnyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.\u201d",
      "The response did not address the dismissal of Garcia\u2019s identification.",
      "Garcia denied that he interrupted an arrest. He told NBC News that he was trying to take out his phone when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent took it and threw it to the ground and then an agent began grabbing him.",
      "Venegas said Garcia's brother has signed deportation papers because the family didn't want him detained \"forever\" as they've seen happen to another family member, who was held for months in a Louisiana detention center.",
      "\"It's inhumane, what they are doing to our people. They are treating them as if they were murderers,\" she said.",
      "Venegas said the immigration arrests are creating repercussions among Hispanics, even among U.S. citizens.",
      "\"It's about race now. It's not about whether you are here legally or not,\" she said.",
      "Her family owns a fairly large contracting company, she said, \"and a lot of the people that work with us are not working. ... They are refusing to go to work. They said they are not going to go until this stuff calms down.\"",
      "Venegas added that the majority of her family is self-employed and \"we do the same thing every other citizen does.\"",
      "\"It's just insane we can't be different, the color that we are. We contribute to this country the same way every other citizen does with their taxes,\" she said. \"But we have to be the ones that every time we go to work, we are going to be scared that we're going to get discriminated.\"",
      "\"I think about my family,\" she said. \"Even though a lot of them are citizens, I think about how we all work in the same area in construction and they can't sit out there because they could literally get harassed or attacked the way my cousin did.\""

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack early Saturday with explosions and machine gun fire heard throughout the city, forcing many Kyiv residents to take shelter in underground subway stations.",
      "The nighttime Russian attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an exchange that was agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday, acting head of Kyiv military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, wrote on Telegram. According to Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack, and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "Before the attack, city mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned Kyiv residents of more than 20 Russian strike drones heading towards Kyiv. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend that will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "As the freed men entered the medical facility Friday, people holding signs and photos of their relatives shouted names or brigade numbers, seeking any news of a loved one.",
      "\u201cVanya!\u201d cried Nataliia Mosych, among the gathered relatives, \u201cMy husband!\u201d",
      "The exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians at one time, didn\u2019t herald any halt in fighting.",
      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks to end the fighting as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday night that Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \u201csustainable, long-term, comprehensive\u201d peace agreement once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army\u2019s battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday."

      "The attacker targeted people on the platform between tracks 13 and 14 in the station at around 6 p.m., according to police. The station in downtown Hamburg, Germany\u2019s second-biggest city, is a major hub for local, regional and long-distance trains.",
      "Late Friday evening, Hamburg\u2019s fire service said that 17 people in total were hurt \u2014 four of them with life-threatening injuries. Six others had serious injuries, and the remaining seven had light injuries, German news agency dpa reported.",

      "There was no immediate indication of any political motive, and investigators were looking into whether the suspect may have been mentally ill, police spokesperson Florian Abbenseth said.",

    "story": [
      "The once-solid relationship between President Donald Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook is breaking down over the idea of a U.S.-made iPhone.",
      "Last week, Trump said he \u201chad a little problem with Tim Cook,\u201d and on Friday, he threatened to slap a 25% tariff on iPhones in a social media post.",
      "Trump is upset with Apple\u2019s plan to source the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. from its factory partners in India, instead of China. Cook confirmed this plan earlier this month during earnings discussions.",
      "Trump wants Apple to build iPhones for the U.S. market in the U.S. and has continued to pressure the company and Cook.",
      "\u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday.",
      "Analysts said it would probably make more sense for Apple to eat the cost rather than move production stateside.",
      "\u201cIn terms of profitability, it\u2019s way better for Apple to take the hit of a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US market than to move iPhone assembly lines back to US,\u201d Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote on X.",
      "UBS analyst David Vogt said that the potential 25% tariffs were a \u201cjarring headline\u201d but that they would only be a \u201cmodest headwind\u201d to Apple\u2019s earnings, dropping annual earnings by 51 cents per share, versus a prior expectation of 34 cents per share under the current tariff landscape.",
      "Experts have long held that a U.S.-made iPhone is impossible at worst and highly expensive at best.",
      "Analysts have said that iPhones made in the U.S. would be much more expensive, CNBC previously reported, with some estimates ranging between $1,500 and $3,500 to buy one at retail. Labor costs would certainly rise.",
      "But it would also be logistically complicated.",
      "Supply chains and factories take years to build out, including installing equipment and staffing up. Parts that Apple imported to the United States for assembly might be subject to tariffs as well.",
      "Apple started manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017 but it was only in recent years that the region was capable of building Apple\u2019s latest devices.",
      "\u201cWe believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\u201d wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note on Friday.",
      "Other analysts were wary about predicting how Trump\u2019s threat ultimately plays out. Apple might be able to strike a deal with the administration \u2014 despite the eroding relationship \u2014 or challenge the tariffs in court.",
      "For now, most of Apple\u2019s most important products are exempt from tariffs after Trump gave phones and computers a tariff waiver \u2014 even from China \u2014 in April, but Apple doesn\u2019t know how the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs will ultimately play out beyond June.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re skeptical\u201d that the 25% tariff will materialize, wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.",
      "He wrote that Apple could try to preserve its roughly 41% gross margin on iPhones by raising prices in the U.S. by between $100 and $300 per phone.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Trump intends to target Apple\u2019s India-made iPhones. Rakers wrote that the administration could put specific tariffs on phone imports from India.",
      "Apple\u2019s operations in India continue to expand.",
      "Foxconn, which assembles iPhones for Apple, is building a new $1.5 billion factory in India that could do some iPhone production, the Financial Times reported Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s a stark contrast between the effects on high earners and those on low-income households in a sprawling legislative package House Republicans passed Thursday.",
      "The bulk of the financial benefits in the legislation \u2014 called the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d \u2014 would flow to the wealthiest Americans, courtesy of tax-cutting measures such as those for business owners, investors and homeowners in high-tax areas, experts said.",
      "However, low earners would be worse off, they said. That\u2019s largely because Republicans partially offset those tax cuts \u2014 estimated to cost about $4 trillion or more \u2014 with reductions to social safety net programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The tax and spending package now heads to the Senate, where it may face further changes.",
      "'It skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy'",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal scorekeeper, estimates income for the bottom 10% of households would fall by 2% in 2027 and by 4% in 2033 as a result of the bill\u2019s changes.",
      "By contrast, those in the top 10% would get an income boost from the legislation: 4% in 2027 and 2% in 2033, CBO found.",
      "A Yale Budget Lab analysis found a similar dynamic.",
      "The bottom 20% of households \u2014 who make less than $14,000 a year \u2014 would see their annual incomes fall about $800 in 2027, on average, Yale estimates.",
      "The top 20% \u2014 who earn over $128,000 a year \u2014 would see theirs grow by $9,700, on average, in 2027. The top 1% would gain $63,000.",
      "The Yale and CBO analyses don\u2019t account for last-minute changes to the House legislation, including stricter work requirements for Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration.",
      "The legislation compounds the regressive nature of the Trump administration\u2019s recent tariff policies, economists said.",
      "\u201cIf you incorporated the [Trump administration\u2019s] hike in tariffs, this would be even more skewed against lower- and working-class families,\u201d Tedeschi said.",
      "Most tax cuts in the bill go to top-earning households",
      "There are several ways the House bill skews toward the wealthiest Americans, experts said.",
      "Among them are more valuable tax breaks tied to business income, state and local taxes and the estate tax, experts said.",
      "These tax breaks disproportionately flow to high earners, experts said. For example, the bottom 80% of earners would see no benefit from the House proposal to raise the SALT cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "The bill also preserves a lower top tax rate, at 37%, set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would have expired at the end of the year.",
      "It kept a tax break intact that allows investors to shield their capital gains from tax by funneling money into \u201copportunity zones.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law created that tax break, with the aim of incentivizing investment in lower-income areas designated by state governors. Taxpayers with capital gains are \u201chighly concentrated\u201d among the wealthy, according to the Tax Policy Center.",
      "All told, 60% of the bill\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 20% of households and more than a third would go to those making $460,000 or more, according to the Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cThe variation among income groups is striking,\u201d the analysis said.",
      "Why many low earners are worse off",
      "That said, more than 8 in 10 households overall would get a tax cut in 2026 if the bill is enacted, the Tax Policy Center found.",
      "Lower earners stand to benefit from provisions including a higher standard deduction and temporarily enhanced child tax credit, and tax breaks tied to tip income and car loan interest, for example, experts said.",
      "However, some of those benefits may not be as valuable as they seem at first glance, experts said. For example, roughly one-third of tipped workers don\u2019t pay federal income tax, Tedeschi said. They wouldn\u2019t benefit from the proposed tax break on tips \u2014 it\u2019s structured as a tax deduction, which doesn\u2019t benefit households without tax liability, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower-income households, which rely more on federal safety net programs, would see cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and benefits linked to student loans and Affordable Care Act premiums, said Kent Smetters, an economist and faculty director at the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The House bill would, for example, impose work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP beneficiaries. Total federal spending on those programs would fall by about $700 billion and $267 billion, respectively, through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis.",
      "That said, \u201cif you are low income and don\u2019t get SNAP, Medicaid or ACA premium support, you will be slightly better off,\u201d Smetters said.",
      "Some high earners would pay more in tax",
      "In a sense, it may not be surprising most tax benefits accrue to the wealthy.",
      "The U.S. has among the most progressive tax systems in the developed world, Smetters said.",
      "The top 10% of households pay about 70% of all federal taxes, he said. Such households would get about 65% of the total value of the legislation, according to a Penn Wharton analysis published Monday.",
      "A subset of high earners \u2014 17% of the top 1% of households, who earn at least $1.1 million a year \u2014 would pay more in tax, according to the Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cIn part this is due to limits on the ability of some pass-through businesses to fully deduct their state and local taxes and a limit on all deductions for top-bracket households,\u201d wrote Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.",

To make sure the baby black bear doesn't bond too much with the humans raising it before they try to return the animal to the wild.",
      "The two-month-old black bear cub is the youngest the organization has ever cared for, it said in a statemnet. It's the fourth bear this young in five years to enter rehabilitation care in California.",
      "Campers in the Los Padres National Forest found the cub, weak, underweight and alone, on April 12, the humane society said. After failed attempts to reunite the cub with its mother in the wild, California Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists dropped the bear off April 14 at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center.",
      "\"Our team stepped in to give him the second chance he deserved,\" the humane society said on Instagram.",
      "More than 30 days into its stay, the cub is stable, playful and thriving, the humane society said.",
      "\"He was extremely fragile when he arrived,\" said Autumn Welch, Wildlife Operations Manager at the Ramona Wildlife Center. \"After going several days without nutrition, it was touch-and-go at first. But now, he's active, eating well and gaining weight steadily.\"",
      "The group plans on watching after the cub for up to a year, to prepare it to return to the wild once it's old and strong enough.",
      "The organization said the state wildlife agency would try to pair the animal with another cub should one end up in state care, calling this \"a critical strategy to keep orphaned cubs wild and reduce the risk of imprinting on humans.\"",
      "The other strategy the organization is employing to ensure the little bear doesn't bond too much with his human caretakers: having its team wear bear suits \"to mimic maternal behaviors,\" it said on Instagram.",
      "The bear cub gets four enrichment and feeding sessions a day that will help to prepare it for life in the wild, the humane society said, noting the \"extraordinary amount of time, expertise and resources\" it takes to raise a bear from this young age. Welch also said it's rare to see cubs this young without their mothers.",
      "Video shared on the organization's Instagram shows the bear climbing on a makeshift jungle gym in its enclosure and humane society workers playing with it with a stuffed bear toy."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When House Republicans passed President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package on a party-line vote of 215-214, some Democrats couldn\u2019t help but notice that three safe blue seats in their ranks were empty after those lawmakers recently died in their 70s.",
      "\u201cImagine if one of the older and sicker Dems would\u2019ve retired instead of died in office and what that would\u2019ve meant for millions of people,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a consultant who has advised successful Democratic Senate candidates in two swing states over the last three years, said on X.",
      "Even as some Democrats conceded the GOP bill may ultimately have passed anyway, the moment quickly reignited an intraparty debate about gerontocracy and aging politicians clinging to power \u2014 or seeking promotions \u2014 while they show signs of decline or battle grave health issues. The clash has been fueled by an ongoing reckoning over then-President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 decision to run for re-election before dropping out after a disastrous June 2024 debate in which the 81-year-old incumbent struggled to craft sentences.",
      "The cascade of events has bolstered a generational argument, once limited to a narrow group of young progressives, that is now gaining traction inside the Democratic Party, including among seasoned party operatives who say the sentiment is growing.",
      "\u201cYou get accused of ageism when you start having this conversation sometimes. But it\u2019s like, look at an actuarial table,\u201d said Mike Nellis, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked as an adviser to former Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cIt is a fair criticism to say that we need people to walk away. We need people to know when it\u2019s your moment to go off into the sunset.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd no, the debate is not going to go away,\u201d he said.",
      "The clash is even evident inside the ranks of the Democratic National Committee in the form of recently elected Vice Chair David Hogg, a prominent 25-year-old gun safety activist who has called for challenging \u201cout-of-touch\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d lawmakers through primaries in solidly Democratic seats.",
      "\u201cWe have empowered the cruelty of Republicans and handed them an expanded majority because elderly Democratic leaders refused to step down. It is unconscionable,\u201d Hogg told NBC News. \u201cPoliticians only respond to incentives. That means we need to create a set of dynamics where they decide it is in their best interests to retire, and that includes primaries.\u201d",
      "Two Republicans missed the vote early Thursday \u2014 and if they had voted, three additional Democratic \u201cno\u201d votes could have fought it to a tie, blocking the bill, at least at that moment. The GOP would have had to win the votes of one member who voted \u201cpresent\u201d or flip one of the two who voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill.",
      "Hogg speculated that Republicans would probably \u201chave figured out a way to pass it if it failed\u201d due to a tie vote. But he said that\u2019s no excuse for Democrats to make their task easier.",
      "\u201cIt is undeniable, though, that with less Democratic members it gives Trump greater ability to pass what he wants through Congress. And this never had to happen,\u201d Hogg said, adding that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d when Democrats spend tens of millions of dollars to win swing districts but do \u201cnothing to get sick, older members to step down, and then we lose seats because of it.\u201d",
      "One of the three vacancies was the Virginia seat formerly held by Rep. Gerry Connolly, who announced two days after winning re-election in November 2024 that he had been diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus; he was soon chosen by Democrats to be the ranking member on the Oversight Committee. He died on May 21 at age 75. Another was Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, D-Ariz., who died at 77 two months ago after treatment for lung cancer, a diagnosis he announced in April 2024, before winning re-election for the final time. The third was Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, who died of a medical emergency in March at 70, after previously battling bone cancer.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the margin was so close makes this so frustrating. Millions of people are going to lose their health care,\u201d said Amanda Litman, the president of the group Run for Something and author of \u201cWhen We\u2019re in Charge: The Next Generation\u2019s Guide to Leadership.\u201d",
      "Litman and others note that they aren\u2019t calling for lawmakers to be automatically thrown out after a certain age, but they do want to see them face challenges and external pressure to prove why they should keep serving.",
      "\u201cWe are protecting a system that has privileged seniority and entitlement over efficacy,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe system that protected Joe Biden and the system that protects our elected officials in Congress is the same one,\u201d describing it as a mix of politicians\u2019 egos and the acquiescence of staffers and party operatives who should know better.",
      "Litman responded to critics who say Democrats should focus on blaming Republicans rather than turning their anger within, saying that Biden\u2019s re-election effort and the issues in the House taught her the party won\u2019t evolve without pressure.",
      "\u201cThis conversation has to happen in public, because we\u2019ve now seen it\u2019s not happening in private,\u201d she said.",
      "Ashwani Jain, a 35-year-old former Obama administration official and unsuccessful 2024 House candidate, said the Democratic Party is \u201ctoo focused on protecting the old guard \u2014 propping up aging politicians while sidelining the next generation of leaders.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe establishment clings to a model that prioritizes seniority, fundraising and insider connections over fresh ideas and grassroots energy,\u201d said Jain, who wrote the new book \u201cProject 2027: A Progressive Blueprint to Reclaim Congress and Protect Democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about ageism \u2014 it\u2019s about urgency,\u201d he said.",
      "Another factor driving the conversation is the widespread belief in both parties that House majorities are likely to be narrow for the foreseeable future, which means that every seat can have national consequences.",
      "\u201cMembers often continue to run for the right reasons \u2014 there\u2019s always unfinished business in public service \u2014 but continuing to run with major illnesses leads to painful ends to otherwise accomplished careers,\u201d said Ashley Schapitl, a former top communicator for Democratic senators and the Treasury Department. \u201cCongressional margins have been tight since the 2020 election, making every seat count more than in previous years in determining the outcomes of legislative fights that have monumental consequences for the American people.\u201d",
      "Nellis said aging politicians eventually become \u201cout of step culturally\u201d and, in refusing to step down, are \u201cpreventing future leaders from stepping up, and it creates a cascading problem\u201d by freezing opportunities down the ladder. He said generational change would also mitigate the party\u2019s political struggles to communicate in the modern media.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of leaders who are very smart, care passionately about the issues, but they can\u2019t go do the media the way that we need them to,\u201d Nellis said. \u201cAnd right now what I need is a lot more politicians that can sit on the podcast for three hours and talk about a bunch of issues and get into weird, goofy personal stuff and sit with Joe Rogan. And I don\u2019t have a lot of those.\u201d",
      "It isn\u2019t just politicians, he added.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a generational change problem throughout the Democratic Party,\u201d Nellis said, calling for new consultants, campaign managers, communicators and surrogates, in addition to new legislators. \u201cSo that generation change \u2014 it is actively happening inside the Democratic Party at every level.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis order, like the others, seeks to chill legal representation the administration doesn\u2019t like, thereby insulating the Executive Branch from the judicial check fundamental to the separation of powers,\" Bates wrote. \"It thus violates the Constitution and the Court will enjoin its operation in full.\u201d",
      "Bates noted that not every firm targeted by the administration opted to sue, seeming to critique those firms who threw in the towel and agreed to give the Trump administration free legal assistance.",
      "\"Without ever receiving an executive order, these firms preemptively bargained with the administration and struck deals sparing them. The deals largely mirror Paul Weiss\u2019s, though the price continues to rise: instead of $40 million, these firms have pledged $100 million or more in pro bono legal services the administration has a hand in choosing,\" Bates wrote. \"And in public statements, the President has floated the prospect of deploying the firms to work on the administration\u2019s own projects, rather than traditional pro bono causes, while acknowledging the firms\u2019 lack of wrongdoing.\"",
      "Bates was skeptical of the Justice Department's arguments during a hearing last month.",

      "However, Gutierrez-Reed was required to serve at least 85% of her sentence, Roembach said. In New Mexico, those convicted of a \"serious violent offense\" have this requirement. Involuntary manslaughter is not considered a serious violent offense in all cases, but some, like the armorer's, have drawn that 85% threshold based on circumstances.",

      "The agreement \u201cguarantees further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing immediately, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial.\u201d",
      "The DOJ said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the case once the \u201cagreement in principle\u201d is finalized, by no later than the end of next week.",
      "Under the agreement, Boeing will have to \u201cpay or invest\u201d more than $1.1 billion, the DOJ said in its filing in federal court in Texas on Friday. That amount includes a $487.2 million criminal fine, though $243.6 million it already paid in an earlier agreement would be credited. It also includes $444.5 million for a new fund for crash victims, and $445 million more on compliance, safety and quality programs.",
      "Boeing declined to comment.",
      "The company has been trying for years to put the two crashes of its best-selling Max planes \u2014 a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight less than five months later \u2014 behind it. The Maxes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after the second crash, a pause that gave rival Airbus a head start in recovering from the Covid pandemic.",
      "But families of the crash victims have criticized previous agreements as sweetheart deals for Boeing, called for more accountability from the company and said its executives should stand trial. In 2022, a former chief technical pilot for Boeing was acquitted on fraud charges tied to the Max\u2019s development.",
      "Several of the victims\u2019 family members issued a statement through their lawyer shortly after the court filing was released criticizing the deal and saying it set a troubling precedent for other large companies.",
      "\u201cThis kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history. My families will object and hope to convince the court to reject it,\u201d said the families\u2019 lawyer, Paul Cassell.",
      "The Justice Department said relatives of more than 110 crash victims told the government they support the non-prosecution agreement or \u201csupport the Department\u2019s efforts to resolve the case pre-trial more generally,\u201d but added that others said they want the U.S. to take Boeing to trial and that they would litigate to dismiss the deal.",
      "The aerospace giant reached a settlement in 2021 in the final days of the first Trump administration that shielded it from prosecution for three years.",
      "Under that deal, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.51 billion fine to avoid prosecution. That included a $243.6 million criminal penalty, a $500 million fund for crash victims\u2019 family members and $1.77 billion for its airline customers. The new fund will be on top of the $500 million that was already established.",
      "That 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5, 2024, after the aircraft left Boeing\u2019s factory without key bolts installed.",
      "But last year, U.S. prosecutors said Boeing violated the 2021 settlement, accusing the company of failing to set up and enforce a compliance and ethics program to detect violations of U.S. fraud laws.",
      "Last July, toward the end of the Biden administration, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to the criminal fraud charge in a new settlement. A federal judge later rejected the plea deal, citing concerns with diversity, equity and inclusion requirements for choosing a corporate monitor.",
      "Under that 2024 deal, Boeing would have faced a fine of up to $487.2 million, though the Justice Department recommended that the court credit Boeing with half that amount it paid under the previous agreement.",
      "The U.S. had accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two crashes.",
      "\u201cBoeing\u2019s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,\u201d then-acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division said at the time of the 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.",
      "Messages revealed in an investigation into the Max\u2019s development showed the former top Boeing pilot who was found not guilty of fraud in 2022, Mark Forkner, told the FAA to delete the flight-control system known as MCAS from manuals and, in a separate email, he boasted about \u201cjedi-mind tricking\u201d regulators into approving the training material.",
      "Lawyers for victims\u2019 family members railed against last year\u2019s preliminary plea deal, equating it to a slap on the wrist for the corporate giant, which recently won a contract worth billions to build the next-generation fighter jet and works on other military programs including outfitting two new presidential jets.",

    "story": [
      "This week, Julie Eshelman has been holding her breath, waiting to see if President Donald Trump delivers on his campaign promise to make in vitro fertilization free.",
      "Eshelman is a military wife and, thanks to IVF, a mom. She first began fertility treatments in 2016, and she and her husband finally welcomed a baby girl \u2014 five years, several miscarriages and $80,000 later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a financial burden, but it\u2019s one that we would do over and over again so that we can have our family,\u201d Eshelman told NBC News.",
      "She couldn\u2019t have imagined then that Trump\u2019s second term as president might factor heavily in her decision about whether or not to try for a second baby.",
      "\u201cHearing presidential candidates and the president talking about IVF \u2014 those things weren\u2019t happening five years ago or 10 years ago,\u201d she said, reflecting on the 2024 campaign. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be hopefully optimistic, but there definitely is that side of me that is skeptical of what is to come.\u201d",
      "Trump told NBC News on the campaign trail last year that if he is elected,  his administration would work to make IVF paid for by either the government or insurance companies. The proposal came amid broader political conflict on family policies and abortion in 2024, after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos were considered people under state law, forcing pauses in IVF care before legislators passed a new law.",
      "After he took office, Trump signed an executive order in February asking for a list of policy recommendations on \u201cprotecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\u201d That 90-day deadline came and went Monday. The White House has not provided an estimate on when it will release its findings.",
      "Details about the discussions that took place over the last 90 days from fertility professionals suggest the talks have been wide-ranging \u2014 including those who are eager for the administration to take immediate action to open up access to expensive fertility treatments, as well as some who cautioned the White House away from focusing on IVF.",
      "\u201cAs exciting as the executive order was \u2026 it doesn\u2019t have any actual actions in it,\u201d said TJ Farnsworth, president of Fertility Providers Alliance and the founder of a chain of fertility clinics.",
      "Farnsworth says FPA, a trade group of reproductive medicine providers, wrote a letter to the White House laying out a \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d of ideas for the administration. The White House responded and invited him to meet in March.",
      "\u201cWe brought to the table a fairly broad set of ideas,\u201d said Farnsworth, including training programs to address a shortage of fertility providers in the United States, providing coverage for federal employees and providing more robust coverage for active-duty members of the military.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a thought that there is coverage for our military,\u201d he said. \u201cThey failed to understand how limited that coverage was \u2026 and so they were interested to hear about that.\u201d",
      "Farnsworth said he was also eager to address a division in Trump\u2019s base \u2014 opposition to IVF from anti-abortion activists and others who believe life begins at conception and therefore believe embryos are people, not to be discarded over the course of fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sometimes a competing narrative of whether or not what we do in an IVF clinic and fertility services are congruent with pro-life movements, and so we wanted to make it clear to them, from our perspective, we consider ourselves the definition of pro-life,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cIf you could only create a couple of a certain number of embryos every time you wanted to attempt pregnancy, it would skyrocket the cost of services for patients.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they were also excited to hear the idea that there is no fertility clinic in the country anymore that creates dozens and dozens of embryos,\u201d he said of the administration.",
      "The White House also met with members of groups who are opposed to IVF.",
      "After Trump signed his executive order in February, the Catholic Medical Association put out a statement calling on the administration to \u201creconsider its promotion of IVF\u201d in favor of \u201cmore ethical and effective measures to address infertility.\u201d The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops put out a similar statement.",
      "Both groups called for the White House to instead focus its efforts on restorative reproductive medicine, which supporters say addresses the \u201croot cause\u201d of infertility. The approach is also supported by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "The White House met with some who favor restorative reproductive medicine over IVF.",
      "\u200b\u200b\u201cI felt like there was interest. I felt like they asked thoughtful questions,\u201d said Dr. Marguerite Duane, co-founder of FACTS About Fertility and a proponent of restorative reproductive medicine.",
      "\u201cThey asked the question, how scalable is it? How easy is it for women to learn to track their cycle?\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, \u201cExpanding IVF access for everyday Americans who have been struggling to start families is a key priority for President Trump. The Administration\u2019s close coordination with outside stakeholder groups across the political spectrum to inform our IVF access plan reflects our commitment to delivering on this priority for the American people.\u201d",
      "The inclusion of groups opposed to IVF and the administration\u2019s elimination of the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tracked the use and success of the procedure have alarmed some groups in the space, including major advocacy groups who were not invited to meet with the White House.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very closely with a team at the CDC who worked on IVF,\u201d\u00a0 said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a patient advocacy group. \u201cI\u2019d certainly want the best and smartest and experienced people surrounding me on that particular topic, and that\u2019s who those people were. So they are now gone, and so they certainly cannot weigh in and provide any input on these policy recommendations.\u201d",
      "Fertility experts have also questioned why the White House did not include the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in its talks.",
      "Sean Tipton, the chief policy officer for both groups, told NBC News the groups reached out repeatedly to the White House and never heard back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why the White House would not want to meet with us. We have led efforts in states on IVF access for years. It\u2019s a topic we know a little something about,\u201d he said.",
      "Since having her daughter, Eshelman has channeled her energy into helping other military families navigate infertility and extra challenges that come along with military service. She founded an advocacy group called Building Military Families.",
      "\u201cEvery time we move, we have to re-establish care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat process and the expense of having to transport our embryos from state to state just adds to all of that, and that\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019ve talked about recently is, you know, do we want to try again? Can we afford to try again?\u201d",
      "Eshelman says she\u2019s trying to remain hopeful \u2014 but she thinks there are things Trump could do right now to help families like hers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they needed 90 days to gather those policy recommendations. There\u2019s a lot of legislation that has been introduced over the last several years that is already there, and they could get it done this week if they really wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, actions speak louder than words, and the actions that have been taken so far don\u2019t really change the status quo.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The brain disorder that forced Billy Joel to cancel his concert tour can cause trouble walking and thinking straight \u2014 but is often treatable and can even be reversed, doctors said.",
      "A post on the 76-year-old singer\u2019s Instagram on Friday said that he was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus and that concert performances exacerbated problems with his \u201chearing, vision, and balance.\u201d",
      "The condition is relatively uncommon, according to the Cleveland Clinic, affecting \u201cabout 5.9% of people over 80.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s most commonly diagnosed in older adults, usually showing up around age 70.",
      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "The human body is constantly trying to keep a steady level of cerebrospinal fluid to cushion the brain and spinal cord, either by making more or absorbing it.",
      "That fluid tends to take up a little more space in older adults because brain volume shrinks as a normal part of the aging process, said Dr. Wajd Al-Holou, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan Health.",
      "\"But what happens in normal pressure hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of fluid that causes brain dysfunction because of the pressure it's putting on the brain,\" he said.",
      "What are the symptoms and how is it diagnosed?",
      "Patients are often diagnosed after they see a doctor because they \u2014 or a family member \u2014 are concerned they might be developing dementia, which is also more common as people age.",
      "Memory loss, bladder control issues and trouble walking are also common. Patients can have trouble lifting their feet, putting them at risk for stumbling and falling.",
      "Doctors often learn about normal pressure hydrocephalus and its three hallmark symptoms with this catchphrase: 'wet, wobbly and weird,' said Dr. Vikram Udani, a neurosurgeon in private practice in San Diego.",
      "\"The 'weird' is the cognitive issue, typically things like memory problems or confusion, and the 'wobbly' stands for gait instability,\" he said. \"The 'wet' is the urinary incontinence.\"",
      "Brain imaging, either a CT scan or an MRI, is generally used to look for the buildup of fluid, as well as a variety of neurological testing.",
      "Doctors may also do what\u2019s called a lumbar puncture to drain the excess fluid. If the person\u2019s symptoms improve, the condition is often diagnosed as normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH.",
      "Udani said no one knows what causes the condition, but added that it's highly unlikely that loud music or concert touring would trigger NPH.",
      "How is it treated?",
      "It can look like dementia, but there\u2019s a key difference: normal pressure hydrocephalus is treatable and in many cases reversible if it\u2019s caught early.",
      "Commonly, neurosurgeons implant a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, or tube, into the brain that helps drain the fluid buildup into another part of the body, like the abdomen. The patient then essentially pees the excess fluid out, Udani said.",
      "A drug called acetazolamide can also be used, as it may help the body decrease the level of fluid on its own. The medicine doesn\u2019t work for everyone, Al-Holou said.",
      "It was unclear Friday what kind of treatment Joel would receive. His social media post said that the singer \u201cis undergoing specific physical therapy,\u201d but did not give details.",
      "That kind of therapy is usually given, doctors said, to help patients regain balance.",
      "Any treatment is more effective if a diagnosis is made quickly. If the condition goes on too long unchecked, it could lead to permanent brain damage, Al-Holou said.",
      "If a person seems to be experiencing early signs such as troublesome memory loss and difficulty walking, \u201cthey should see a primary care physician or neurologist to investigate further,\u201d he said."

      "Kim Kardashian is speaking out after a panel of judges and jurors reached a verdict in her jewelry heist trial.",
      "In 2016 during Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian, 44, was held at gunpoint in her hotel room as a number of people stole $9 million  worth of her jewelry, including a 20-carat diamond ring gifted to her by then-husband Kanye \u201cYe\u201d West, according to prosecutors.",
      "On May 23, eight people were convicted of crimes connected to the robbery, while one was acquitted. One defendant was convicted on a weapons charge that was not directly tied to the robbing of Kardashian. Most of the 10 defendants are in their 60s and 70s.",
      "Upon hearing the news, the Skims co-founder expressed her gratitude and commitment to advocating for justice in a statement.",
      "\u201cI am deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case. The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\u201d Kardashian said in a statement. \u201cWhile I\u2019ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s legal team \u2014 Michael Rhodes, L\u00e9onor Hennerick, and Jonathan Mattout \u2014 also stated that she appreciates the court\u2019s decision and thanked French authorities \u201cfor treating her with great respect throughout the process.\u201d",
      "They noted it has been a long journey \u201cfrom that terrible night back in 2016 to her standing courageously in a historic Paris courtroom to confront these criminals.\u201d",
      "The trial began April 28 in Paris, France, and included testimony from those involved in the robbery, as well as Kardashian's childhood friend and Kardashian herself.",
      "On May 13, the entrepreneur testified inside the Palais de Justice in Paris, France, where she shared details about the experience, including how she begged for her life.",
      "Additionally, a letter from one of the people involved in the heist, Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, was read, in which he apologized for the trauma he put Kardashian through.",
      "During the final court hearing on May 23, defendant Yunice Abbas said in a statement, \u201cI have nothing but regrets to offer you and will take my responsibilities.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old had previously written a book about the experience titled, \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\u201d",

      "The verdict comes days after Kardashian completed her law program. \u201cThe Kardashians\u201d star has been vocal about her passion for prison reform and criminal justice over the years. In a 2019 interview with Vogue, she said it was a factor in her choice to pursue a legal education.",

      "Warning: This post has spoilers for the ending of \u201cFear Street: Prom Queen.\u201d",
      "Fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise know to expect a few things from a new installment: blood, witchcraft and high school terror. \"Fear Street: Prom Queen,\" which premiered on Netflix May 23, delivers all of the above \u2014 this time taking viewers to the cursed town of Shadyside in the '80s, in classic slasher style.",
      "The movie follows outsider Lori Granger (India Fowler) whose social status is low as everyone believes her mother murdered her father.",
      "\"I played it as though she had this intuitive rejection towards that story,\" India Fowler tells TODAY.com. \"She wasn't going to accept it.\"",
      "Lori decides to run for prom queen, believing that \u201cit\u2019s time for something to change.\u201d She runs against five other girls for the coveted title, but one in particular seems to be Lori's biggest competition: her longtime bully Tiffany Falconer (Fina Strazza).",
      "When prom night comes around, it's revealed that two serial killers are roaming the grounds, secretly picking off the six unfortunate prom queen candidates \u2014 and their dates \u2014 one by one.",
      "Who is the killer and what are their motives?",
      "Unaware of all the killings, Lori sneaks away from the dancing promgoers with crush Tyler (David Iacono) for a private moment. The killer discovers them and immediately kills Tyler. Lori makes a quick escape, running into her friend Megan (Suzanna Son) who is also fleeing the killer. The two eventually make it back to prom and try to warn everyone about the danger. But everyone ignores them as Lori is crowned prom queen and pulled up onto the stage.",
      "She begs for people to listen to her, but nobody does, before the killer cuts through the crowd with an axe. He then gets on the stage and tries to kill Lori, but Megan jumps on him, giving Lori the opportunity to plunge the crown into his eye. He falls to the ground in pain and pulls his mask off, revealing that Tiffany's dad, Dan Falconer (Chris Klein), is the culprit.",
      "In front of everyone, he admits to his wife and daughter that he did it \"because I knew how much you wanted it, both of you.\"",
      "His wife, Nancy Falconer (Katherine Waterston), is shocked by the revelation, but stays behind to answer the police's questions as Tiffany and Lori \u2014 who happen to be neighbors \u2014 are sent home with police officers.",
      "In the car ride home, Tiffany begins her redemption, apologizing to Lori and admitting that she was \"never good enough\" for her parents, and she's always \"felt like nothing.\"",
      "\"You start to sympathize with her,\" Fowler says. \"And I definitely, when reading the script, sympathized with Tiffany because it\u2019s back to that kind of teenage girl going through mental turmoil. You start seeing her as this real human, young woman.\"",
      "Finna Strazza describes her character as just being a \"product of her environment.\"",
      "\"She has always had a lot of pressure put on her her whole life, by her family, by her peers,\" she adds.",
      "When the girls finally reach their homes, Tiffany asks Lori not to leave. Lori offers to stay and goes inside, and the two spark a \"potential friendship\" after the night's bloody events, Fowler says.",
      "\"Lori will always choose to care for somebody and choose to be selfless,\" Fowler says.",
      "Eventually, Nancy Falconer gets home, but she's not a concerned mother \u2014 she's another killer. She grabs a knife and begins chasing the girls through the house while humming. Terrified, they hide in the closet. There, Tiffany begins freaking out that both her parents are dangerous, yet it turns out she is, too. Tiffany pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori.",
      "Strazza says this part was not initially in the script.",
      "\u201cThe original version I read, Tiffany was not involved at all, and it was just the parents,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the scene that I was doing for my audition, she was just crying, and was like, \u2018Mom, how could you do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "Director Matt Palmer had her improvise being the killer during her final audition. Strazza landed the part, and the script was altered so she was involved in the gruesome finale.",
      "Even with the threat of Tiffany, Lori escapes, running into the hallway where Nancy stabs her in the shoulder blade. With Lori injured, Nancy admits that she used to date Lori's dad and reveals she killed him after he left her for Lori's mom. Nancy prepares to kill Lori, but Tiffany asks to do it.",
      "\"I warned you,\" Tiffany tells Lori before Lori kicks her, sending her flying over the banister where she is then impaled on a table decoration below.",
      "Strazza says that she always likes to do her own stunts, and this 12-foot fall was no different. She describes it as a \"roller coaster.\" But when it came time for the impalement, that was a silicone mold.",
      "\"They made an entirely silicone mold of my entire body, where I was first covered in silicone,\" she says. \"And while that hardened, they covered that in plaster, so I was just kind of stuck as this statue. It ended up taking six and a half hours to get my whole body, but the artistry that was involved in that was so impressive because it looked exactly like me. And it was kind of spooky to see that on set.\"",
      "\"I would walk past my own dead body, which was frightening,\" she adds.",
      "What does Lori's final line mean?",
      "With just Nancy left, Lori tries to escape, but the doors are locked. Eventually, Lori grabs a trophy and whacks Nancy in the head with it. She falls to the ground, slowly dying as she begs Lori for help.",
      "But Lori just walks away as Nancy spews insults, calling her \"trash,\" \"nothing\" and a \"nobody.\"",
      "Nancy's final words before slumping to her death are, \"Who the f--- do you think you are?\"",
      "\"I'm Lori f---ing Granger,\" Lori responds.",
      "Fowler considers the whole film to be Lori's journey to \"self-realization,\" with this final moment being her true acceptance of self.",
      "\"'I\u2019m Lori f---ing Granger' is that moment,\" she says. \"It\u2019s earnest. And she really has gone through it. And been there, like you\u2019ve seen her go through the turmoil.\"",
      "Fowler believes that after the film ends, Lori is \"definitely traumatized,\" but she hopes she comes to terms with what has happened.",
      "\"It would be interesting to imagine how she deals with self-redemption and self-acceptance, which I hope she's experiencing post film,\" she says.",
      "What does the end credit scene mean?",
      "Even though the film is on Netflix, stick around a little longer for an end credit scene. Although it's brief, fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise will recognize the end credit scene ties the film back to the original trilogy.",
      "The end credit scene shows Nancy Falconer's dead body lying on the ground, blood oozing from her head. But then, the blood begins to form into the Witch's Mark \u2014 also known as the Devil\u2019s Mark from the original franchise.",
      "In the initial trilogy, the Witch's Mark was where Shadyside residents were sacrificed by the Goode family to Satan.",
      "Fowler calls this moment \"a nod to the curse\" from the original trilogy and a way for their film to \"pay homage\" to the origins.",
      "\"This film is its own thing,\" she says. \"You don't necessarily have to watch the first three to understand this film, but I think that they did such a good job of doing the subtle nod to the fact that Shadyside is a cursed town, and it's inescapable and it's still apparent.\"",
      "She adds that the end credits aren't the only \"Easter egg\" to the original trilogy. In fact, at the beginning of the film, there's a small shrine to everyone who died in the 1978 camp massacre, alluding to the events of the second film.",
      "Were the Falconers cursed?",
      "With that in mind, it begs the question: Was the Falconer family another victim of the curse of Shadyside?",
      "Strazza thinks so.",
      "\"I think there's something in the water,\" she says. \"I think that it's not a coincidence that these crazy people end up on the loose. Who knows who is connected to the Falconers in the past?\"",
      "Personally, Strazza thinks Tiffany \"sold her soul to the devil.\"",
      "One potential reason? Strazza pitches a search for \"forever beauty.\"",
      "\"That would be something the Falconers would be into,\" she adds."

      "Fowler adds that Strazza was not alone in being directed to improvise certain moments. For the teens' dance battle, Strazza was taught classic '80s choreography, but Fowler was asked to improvise.",

      "\u201cBut we have no plans to be in that,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I do wish her the best, because the script I read, I thought, was really good and a new and different take that really brings the office up to date the way that people live now.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe had one official crack at the script,\u201d Tomlin told People in 2024. \u201cThe draft just didn\u2019t work for us. We couldn\u2019t really see the work world today (in the pages). People work from home. They take gig work. They don\u2019t even know their boss. They\u2019re at home!\u201d",

      "\u201cI felt sort of the same way I felt about the musical. You know, part of you feels rejected. You think that character\u2019s yours always. And you could reembody it,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to make (the movie) happen. My sympathies are with Jennifer and her writer Diablo, who is a good writer.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Sirens.\"",
      "Is Michaela Kell's mysterious lifestyle really a cult? The question that loomed over the five episodes of Netflix's \"Sirens\" is finally answered in the finale, which premiered on May 22.",
      "The resolution of an explosive weekend on a lavish New England island leaves no character unscathed, as the lives of the people in Michaela's orbit are completely upended.",
      "Julianne Moore, who stars as Michaela in the series, tells TODAY.com the series started as a look at the Greek myth of sirens \u2014 winged creatures, half-birds and half-women, with songlike voices capable of luring sailors at sea to their demise.",
      "\u201cWhy do we hear about the sirens from this perspective? We always hear about it from the sailors\u2019 perspectives, not from the sirens\u2019 perspective,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, what are the sirens asking for? And in fact, why are they responsible and not the men?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men are always saying, \u2018These women lured me in. These women made me crash my ship. These women made me throw my life away.\u2019 Suddenly, these men have no agency. They have no autonomy,\u201d she adds.",
      "Moore says it was the daughter of the series\u2019 showrunner, Molly Smith Metzler, who asked her mom the questions about Greek sirens that led her to write the play the series is based on.",
      "\u201cI think Molly wanted to incorporate that idea into the show, this idea of, \u2018What\u2019s their story?\u2019\u201d Moore says.",
      "What is 'Sirens' about?",
      "The five-episode Netflix series also stars Meghann Fahy as Devon, who travels to the island after being unable to reach her sister Simone, played by Milly Alcock, who is employed as Michaela's assistant.",
      "Devon's arrival on the island causes utter chaos in Michaela's perfectly precise and planned out life. The final episode starts at the end of the whirlwind weekend, as Michaela's annual gala is just beginning.",
      "Michaela has been preparing for the event with beloved assistant Simone by her side for months, but the party gets upended when Michaela decides to fire her hours before it's set to begin. The socialite discovered that her husband, Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), kissed Simone \u2014 and had photographic evidence to prove his infidelity.",
      "While Simone insisted Peter came on to her and that she walked away after the kiss, the discovery came after Michaela found out Simone had been lying to her about her secret relationship with Peter's best friend Ethan (Glenn Howerton).",
      "Simone and Ethan did go public with their relationship earlier in the season, leading him to propose to her, but Simone turned him down. After the rejection, Ethan began to spiral, and he fell off of a cliff while fighting with Simone.",
      "How does 'Sirens' end?",
      "The beginning of Episode 5 starts with Ethan recovering in the hospital, and when he sees Simone in the room, he starts screaming and telling her to get out. Kevin sticks up for Simone, telling Ethan he needs to respect her.",
      "Moore says the series represents a push-and-pull of power dynamics between men and women. While it may look like Michaela is calling the shots, it\u2019s really Peter who is pulling the strings all along.",
      "\u201cPeter Kell has all the power because he has all the money, and this is very much about social and economic hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you really peel it back, you realize the person making the decisions, if you go all the way up, is that billionaire.\u201d",
      "After Peter asks Michaela why she fired Simone, he sees Simone running down to the beach. He follows her, and he tells her that the end of her employment was his fault and that he would fix it. She says she has to tell him something, but the scene cuts away.",
      "The gala is in full swing back at the house as Devon confronts Michaela about the rumors she's a cult leader \u2014 and that she killed Peter's first wife \u2014 in front of all of the guests. Michaela shares that after Peter's divorce, his ex-wife had botched plastic surgery and became a recluse, shutting down all of the town gossip.",
      "After the confrontation, Peter approaches Michaela and asks to talk to her in private. He then tells her he wants a divorce after he claims she kept him from his children from his previous marriage. He also reveals that he had found the photo of him and Simone \u2014 and destroyed it.",
      "Moore says she thinks Devon's arrival on the island may have ignited the tension between Michaela and Peter, but adds their marriage was doomed no matter what.",
      "\"I think it was inevitable,\" Moore says. \"I think these kind of situations, particularly in marriages, if that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen. So it\u2019s not like Devon not coming would have changed anything. I think there would have been the same result.\"",
      "After Michaela storms out of the room, Simone walks down a set of stairs wearing an evening gown. Peter extends his hand, and walks her out \u2014 signaling that what they talked about down at the beach was starting a real relationship.",
      "As they walk into the gala, Simone sees Devon and fills her in that she's now with Peter, much to Devon's shock. Devon says she is going to go back to Buffalo to take care of their father, and the pair share a tearful goodbye when it's clear Simone is planning to stay on the island with Peter.",
      "Simone gets up and gives a toast to the gala's attendees, standing in Michaela's usual place. Devon gets on a ferry back to the mainland.",
      "On the ferry, she runs into Michaela and the pair have a heartfelt conversation about what's next for them.",
      "\"I think she\u2019s ready to get on with her life,\" Moore says of her character. \"In a sense, she\u2019s kind of back to herself. She\u2019s really back to someone who doesn\u2019t know what her future is, but she has agency, and she\u2019ll make decisions based on her own life and her own needs. So I actually think she\u2019s in a good place.\"",
      "The episode ends with a shot of Simone standing in front of Peter's home, looking out at what is now hers and thinking about all it took for her to get here \u2014 and what happened to the person who got in her way."

      "Miley Cyrus revealed the medical condition that's behind her unique voice, and why it impacts her ability to go on tour.",
      "Cyrus shared more about her Reinke's edema diagnosis in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe on May 21.",
      "\u201cI have the Reinke\u2019s edema, which is something that is called, it\u2019s abuse of the vocal cords,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cAnd being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this \u2014 it's a part of my unique anatomy.\u201d",
      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is a voice disorder caused by the swelling of the vocal chords, and occurs when fluid builds up in the outer layer of the vocal chords, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The disorder is most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, but people with chronic acid reflux, or a history of repetitive vocal trauma, like Cyrus, can also be affected.",
      "The \"Flowers\" singer went on to add that she also has a large polyp on her vocal chord, which she says has given her \"a lot of the tone and the texture\" that has made her who she is as a performer.",
      "\"But it's extremely difficult to perform with, because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus, 32, said that sometimes when she calls her mother, Tish Cyrus, at the end of the day, her mom tells her, \"Oh, you sound like you're talking through a radio.\"",
      "\"And that's how you know I'm really tired, because it creates that ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said. \"And so I do have this blessing of a condition that I live with.\"",
      "Cyrus said that even though she has both Reinke's edema and the large polyp on her vocal chord, she doesn't have plans to remove the polyp.",
      "\"I'm not willing to sever it, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus told Lowe she plans a tour \"like every other week,\" but that her health and other factors play into her actually going on the road to perform.",
      "\"I want to do it, but it would have to be in a way that is sustainable for me in all the ways that we talked about, and then also with what I got going on,\" she said. \"Like, I don't lip sync. I sing live, and these songs are big.\"",
      "She referred to two songs on her upcoming record, \"Something Beautiful,\" which is set to drop on May 30.",
      "\"'End of the World' is a huge song, and 'More to Lose,' it's really strenuous, it's a big song. And so I don't write little songs,\" Cyrus said. \"And even if you listen to the past albums, like 'Party in the U.S.A.,' maybe, if you're in the audience and you're singing along, it's one thing, but when you've got the mic and you're performing, it's totally different.\"",
      "Cyrus also listed the logistics of traveling with a big crew, plus transporting the stage and lights, and needing to be able to play a certain amount of shows for it to \"mathematically make sense.\"",
      "\"So really, the problem for me with touring, is not only me, because this is about connecting with people around the world and using my music as a tool to heal,\" she said. \"I've always said, medicate a sick culture through these songs that I've created, or am creating. But the truth of it is is that touring, as much of it's an experience for the audience, it's a business for everybody else.\""

    "story": [
      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the finale of \"Survivor\" Season 48.",
      "Who earned the title of \u201csole \u2018Survivor\u2019\u201d at the end of Season 48 and walked away with the $1 million prize?",
      "As the conclusion to \u201cSurvivor\u201d 48 began on Wednesday, May 21, there were only five castaways remaining: Eva Erickson, Kyle Fraser, Mitch Guerra, Joe Hunter and Kamilla Karthigesu.",
      "The three-hour finale included multiple surprising eliminations  before the winner was announced. So, as host Jeff Probst says every episode, \u201cLet\u2019s get it on!\u201d",
      "Who won 'Survivor' Season 48?",
      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",
      "After the jury members' votes were cast, Probst continued the divisive recent tradition of announcing the winner then and there.",
      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",
      "All the jury members congratulated Kyle, and he toasted his fellow \"Survivor\" cast members with champagne."

      "In 2019, Kim Kardashian spoke about her passion for prison reform in an interview with Vogue, citing it as the driving force behind her decision to pursue a legal education. Despite having never obtained an undergraduate degree, the 44-year-old pursued a nontraditional legal education path known as \u201creading the law,\u201d a program available in California and a number of other states. The approach allows individuals an opportunity to qualify for the bar exam under the mentorship of a licensed attorney.",
      "Khloe Kardashian posted a video capturing her sister sitting on the side of a small stage as two of her mentors spoke about her achievements. Attorney Jessica Jackson, one of the mentors who sponsored Kim Kardashian during her studies, lauded her for putting in the work to achieve her goal while also working as a mother, businesswoman and public figure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute honor to stand here today, not just as mentors, but as witnesses to one of the most inspiring legal journeys we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSix years ago, Kim Kardashian walked into this program with nothing but a fierce desire to fight for justice. No law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination and a mountain of case log books to read.\u201d",
      "Jackson underscored how Kim Kardashian allocated 18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year, for six straight years to study.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s time she carved out while raising four children, running businesses, filming television shows and showing up in courtrooms to advocate for others,\u201d Jackson noted.",
      "In March 2025, E! News reported that Kardashian took the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE),  The National Conference of Bar Examiners notes that the MPRE is a requirement for bar admission in every U.S. jurisdiction (except Wisconsin and Puerto Rico).",
      "Another one of Kim Kardashian's mentors commended her in the ceremony for focusing her efforts on marginalized groups.",
      "Attorney and CNN political correspondent Van Jones was also in attendance and delivered a speech that captured the early skepticism surrounding Kim Kardashian\u2019s legal ambitions and intentions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying not to get emotional,\u201d he said before thanking Kim Kardashian for her efforts and praising her commitment to criminal justice advocacy. \u201cSix years, seven years ago, when you were working on criminal justice, you were not embraced by anybody.\u201d",
      "Jones went on to recall how she chose to work with individuals he described as having been abandoned by society, and at times, their own families.",
      "\u201cThe advocates are always last in line on the other, more popular causes,\" he explained. \"It\u2019s a lonely fight.\"",
      "More photos capturing the event showed Kim Kardashian being celebrated by her sister Kourtney Kardashian Barker as well as a number of her children."

    "story": [
      "When Gillian Flynn sits down to write a book, she never knows the ending.",
      "Such was the case when the New York Times bestselling author wrote her thrilling novel-turned-film \u201cGone Girl,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Flynn is known for her twists, she says she's more interesting in making points about the human psyche and larger-scale world issues.",
      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",
      "Now, Flynn is working on screenwriting and also became a publisher herself, starting her own imprint, Gillian Flynn Books, with upcoming titles like Danie Shokoohi's \"Glass Girls.\"",
      "Flynn chatted with TODAY.com about her books, her new imprint and the advice she'd give aspiring authors.",
      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",
      "I wasn't looking to have an imprint. But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacy Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators.",

      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",

      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",

    "story": [
      "Germany has this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "The historic unit dispatched to the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, was inaugurated Thursday by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said during a military ceremony in the city that \u201cthe security of our Baltic allies is also our security.\u201d",
      "The groundbreaking German military decision is perhaps the most significant in a steady stream of moves by European nations to bolster defenses on NATO\u2019s eastern flank amid persistent security threats from Russia and President Donald Trump's insistence that Europe does more both to defend itself and pay for that defense.",
      "It also comes despite persistent efforts by the Trump administration to bring to an end the Kremlin's three-year-long war in Ukraine.",
      "Among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, the three Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia \u2014 linked to NATO\u2019s main territory only by a narrow corridor that stretches between Russia and its staunch ally Belarus known as the Suwalki Gap \u2014 are perhaps the most vulnerable to an expanded Russian assault.",
      "On Thursday, Merz said that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive revisionism\u201d since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 meant it could seek to redraw the broader map of Europe and not just that of Ukraine.",
      "Standing alongside Merz, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da added that Russia and Belarus had already begun conducting military exercises on his country\u2019s border.",
      "The new German brigade on NATO\u2019s eastern flank will comprise a heavy combat unit of some 4,800 soldiers, hundreds of civilian staff, and 2,000 vehicles, including tanks. It will be headquartered in Rudninkai near Vilnius and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cAnyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d Merz said.",
      "Trump has been putting pressure on America's NATO allies to increase their military spending, previously accusing Germany and other European countries of \u201cfreeloading\u201d at Washington\u2019s expense and even going as far as implementing a temporary pause on military aid to Ukraine in March this year.",
      "It also marks a shift away from America's guarantee of European security against Russia that has been in place since World War II which has yielded U.S. hard and soft power throughout the continent and beyond.",
      "After his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election in February, Merz said his \u201cabsolute priority\u201d was \u201cstrengthening Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.\u201d",
      "In line with Germany, other European front-line countries have begun upping spending in order to fortify their borders against Russia and Belarus. Earlier this month, Lithuania announced it would spend around $1.2 billion on its military, raising it to 6% of its annual gross domestic product.",
      "Neighboring Poland, meanwhile, recently allocated an additional $2.6 billion to the sector, raising it to 4.7% of its GDP this year.",
      "Despite American diplomats holding several rounds of bilateral negotiations with diplomats from Russia and Ukraine \u2014 Trump held an as-yet-fruitless phone conversation Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 the U.S. president has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "Meanwhile, Putin said in a video conference with Russian government officials Thursday that his military had begun creating a \u201csecurity buffer zone\u201d along its border with Ukraine, a day after he visited the western Russian region of Kursk that Russia says its forces reclaimed from Ukraine earlier this month.",
      "Putin's latest move comes after Russian negotiators reportedly threatened during direct negotiations last week to seize the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Sumy if Ukraine did not agree to the Kremlin\u2019s demands that essentially amount to a surrender from Kyiv.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, this week described the threat as a warning sign from Russia in a report.",
      "\u201cThis tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia\u2019s ceasefire preconditions,\u201d it stated."

      "One of the 10 defendants was fully acquitted on charges of planning and carrying out the armed robbery during Paris Fashion Week in 2016, while another was convicted on a weapons charge that arose from the Kardashian probe \u2014 but wasn\u2019t directly tied to the original crime.",
      "Defendants were cleared of kidnapping allegations but three were convicted of a lesser, similar charge of sequestration with no voluntary liberation as Kardashian was bound at the scene but let there to be found safely.",
      "Years of French bureaucracy delayed the trial by almost a decade, despite the defendants being arrested just months later after police found DNA at the scene.",
      "The three judges and six jurors delivered their verdict shortly after 8 p.m. local time, or 2 p.m. ET. The panel of nine had to reach a super majority of seven for a charge to be adjudicated.",

      "The defendants had previously served varying amounts of pre-trial detention, some as long as two years. But they were all free on Friday night.",

      "With one pointing a gun at her, they stole $9 million of her jewelry, including a 20-carat diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, Kanye West, now known as Ye, prosecutors said.",
      "They escaped on bike and on foot, prosecutors say, only to be arrested months later. Aside from a large cross dropped during the escape, none of the jewels have been recovered.",
      "Eight of the defendants proclaim their innocence. Two have admitted they played some role, though they say this has been overstated by the prosecution.",
      "One of them, Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote a book about it entitled \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\u201d",
      "In a final statement to the court Friday, Abbas said, \u201cI have nothing but regrets to offer you and will take my responsibilities.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors say the mastermind was Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, an alleged veteran of the Paris underworld known as \u201cOld Omar.\u201d He admitted he was involved but claims he was only a foot soldier. He says the real leader was someone called \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 who prosecutors assert does not exist.",
      "Khedache was found guilty of theft with a weapon and holding the victim in sequestration without voluntary liberation.",
      "If Khedache does not commit any crimes or other infractions in the next five years, he could avoid an 8-year term.",

      "Khedache\u2019s son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy Ait Khedache, was found guilty of complicity in escape and using committing larceny with threat of a weapon.  The getaway driver must stay clean for 4 years if he's to avoid a 5-year prison sentence.",

      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light but was never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "summary": "Taiwan's youth are stuck. There's growing concern in Taipei over the reliability of the Trump-led U.S. as a security partner, even despite Chinese aggression.",
    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "The nighttime Russian attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an exchange that was agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday, acting head of Kyiv military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, wrote on Telegram. According to Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack, and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "Before the attack, city mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned Kyiv residents of more than 20 Russian strike drones heading towards Kyiv. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend that will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "As the freed men entered the medical facility Friday, people holding signs and photos of their relatives shouted names or brigade numbers, seeking any news of a loved one.",

      "The exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians at one time, didn\u2019t herald any halt in fighting.",
      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks to end the fighting as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday night that Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \u201csustainable, long-term, comprehensive\u201d peace agreement once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army\u2019s battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump threatened to slap European imports with a sweeping 50% tariff, writing online Friday that trade talks with regional leaders are \"going nowhere.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was \"recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\" That rate would be higher than the 39% Trump promised to hit the bloc with on April 2, the so-called \"Liberation Day\" of far-reaching tariffs he scaled back a week later.",
      "Just minutes earlier on Friday morning, Trump had also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if it does not start producing iPhones in the United States \u2014 an outcome industry experts broadly see as a nonstarter. \"The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale,\" the prominent tech analyst Dan Ives said in response.",
      "Later Friday, Trump was asked whether the European Union could do anything to avoid his 50% tariff threat. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"We're going to see what happens, but right now, it's going on in June 1, and that's the way it is.\"",
      "\"They haven't treated our country properly,\" the president added. \"They banded together to take advantage of us.\"",
      "Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Union's top trade official, posted on X after speaking with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the bloc is \"committed to securing a deal that works for both.\" He said the Commission \"remains ready to work in good faith. EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\"",
      "The 27-member European Union and its predecessor organizations were formed at the urging of the United States to bolster security and economies on both sides of the Atlantic after World War II. The bloc is America's biggest trading partner,with the United States exporting more than $350 billion of goods and $238 billion of services there in recent years. The E.U. is also the largest source of U.S. imports, with the nation buying more than $550 billion worth of goods and more than $170 billion of services.",
      "Trump's early morning posts risked reigniting the trade war he started in April after it had cooled down somewhat in recent weeks. His administration had been speaking positively about ongoing trade talks, even though it has so far secured few concrete economic wins. The president has backed down from some of his most severe tariffs, sparking a comeback for U.S. and global markets.",
      "That rebound looked poised to reverse after Trump\u2019s posts, with stock indexes in Germany, France and Italy each dropping around 1.7%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks hundreds of stocks across Europe, dropped nearly 1%.",
      "U.S. stocks opened sharply lower, but ended the day off their worst levels. The S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight day, closing 0.7% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1%. The Dow ended the day lower by 256 points, or 0.6%.",
      "A number of companies with major U.S. and E.U. operations also saw their shares fall. Deutsche Bank shares plunged 4%, carmakers BMW and Jeep-maker Stellantis each dropped 3.5%, and tech giant SAP fell 2%. Cosmetics firm L'Oreal slid more than 2%, and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH fell 3%.",
      "Trump has repeatedly assailed the European Union, calling it \u201cin many ways, nastier than China.\" On tariff rates and what the U.S. calls \"non-tariff barriers,\" Trump has said, \"They'll come down a lot. You watch.\" But the bloc has refused to alter its value-added tax, a frequent point of contention for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other U.S. officials.",
      "Speaking on CNBC shortly after Trump's social media posts, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted: \"10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.\"",
      "Goolsbee added that it would be \"really scary for the supply chain\" if businesses in his Midwest district, which includes auto hub Detroit, would see tariff rates as high as 50%.",
      "The E.U. has been bracing itself for months for the possibility that trade talks with the U.S. would fail. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission\u2019s trade chief, said in early May that the bloc preferred negotiations, \"but not at any cost.\" He added: \"We therefore continue to prepare for every scenario.\" The following day, the E.U. announced more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"With the exception of the E.U., most [countries] are negotiating in very good faith,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday morning on Fox News. \"I would hope that this would light a fire under the E.U.\"",
      "In 2024, pharmaceutical products were the E.U.'s top export to the United States, with more than $90 billion crossing the Atlantic, followed by more than $45 billion of vehicles and automotive products. Telecom, information technology and scientific services were the top imports."
